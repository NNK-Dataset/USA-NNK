More than 11,800 people have been diagnosed with the rapidly spreading virus. More than 250 have died, all of them in China. The State Department told Americans not to travel there and advised those who are already there to consider leaving.
Following a quarantine order issued Friday, which government officials said was last used in the 1960s, evacuees held at a base in California will have their movements tightly controlled for 14 days after they left China because health experts are still uncertain about how readily the virus spreads.
Here is what we know:
The United States has issued a “Level 4” travel advisory for China, its highest level of caution, over the rapidly spreading outbreak.
Beginning Sunday, the United States will funnel all flights from China to the United States through seven airports.
Americans returning to the United States who have been in China’s Hubei province within 14 days will face a mandatory quarantine. Americans returning to the United States from other parts of China will face enhanced screening and a self-quarantine of up to 14 days.
The World Health Organization has declared the virus a global public health emergency, requiring states to ramp up their responses."
"Feb 2, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/02/01/early-missteps-state-secrecy-china-likely-allowed-coronavirus-spread-farther-faster/,The Washington Post,Early missteps and state secrecy in China probably allowed the coronavirus to spread farther and faster,"BEIJING — It was almost the Lunar New Year and Pan Chuntao was feeling festive.
He knew there were reports of a virus in his city, Wuhan. But local officials urged calmness. There was no evidence it was transmitted person to person, they said. They had not reported a new case in days.
On Jan. 16, the 76-year-old left his two-bedroom apartment to attend a government-organized fair.
“We told him not to go because we saw some rumors on WeChat of doctors getting infected,” said Pan’s son-in-law, Zhang Siqiang. “But he insisted on going. He said, ‘The government says it’s not a problem, there are no cases anymore.’ ”
Pan and his daughter may now be among the the 14,300-plus people infected with a new strain of coronavirus — an outbreak that has killed at least 304 people in China, spread to more than 20 countries, disrupted the global economy and left 55 million people in China’s Hubei province under an unprecedented lockdown.
It was a time when Chinese officials were beginning to grasp the threat of a new contagious disease in Wuhan but did little to inform the public — even with the approach of the Lunar New Year holiday for which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel.
An analysis of those early weeks — from official statements, leaked accounts from Chinese medical professionals, newly released scientific data and interviews with public health officials and infectious disease experts — reveals potential missteps by China’s overburdened public health officials.
It also underscores how a bureaucratic culture that prioritizes political stability over all else probably allowed the virus to spread farther and faster.
“It’s clear that a much stronger public health system could save China lives and money,” said Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Medical professionals who tried to sound an alarm were seized by police. Key state media omitted mention of the outbreak for weeks. Cadres focused on maintaining stability — and praising party leader Xi Jinping — as the crisis worsened.
“China’s public health system has modernized, but China’s political system hasn’t,” said Jude Blanchette, head of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “If anything, there’s been a regression.”"

Some of the United States’ best-known manufacturers such as General Electric, Caterpillar and the Big Three automakers, along with many smaller American businesses, depend on what is made in Chinese factories.
Now, they confront life without those items. Major airlines in the United States and Europe are halting their cargo and passenger flights to China for up to two months. Recent visitors to the country are barred from entering the United States.
After four decades of growing integration with the rest of the world, China almost overnight has become an economic island. Its temporary isolation — no one knows for how long — will hurt companies that depend upon Chinese inputs as well as those that sell to Chinese customers.
Consumer electronics makers are among the most vulnerable, because many game consoles, smartphones and tablets are made in China. On Saturday, Apple announced that it had closed all of its corporate offices and retail stores in China — where it booked $44 billion in sales last year — until Feb. 9 because of the virus.
“The concern is not the zombie apocalypse with people dying in the streets. The concern is that a huge chunk of the global economy gets put out of commission as people wait it out,” said Patrick Chovanec, managing director at Silvercrest Asset Management in New York.
White House advisers so far have played down the disease’s effects, with President Trump’s top economic aide, Larry Kudlow, saying last week that he expects the virus to have “no material impact” on the U.S. economy.
Most Wall Street economists, likewise, say the economic damage will be limited. Economists at JPMorgan Chase Bank on Friday cut their first-quarter global growth estimate by 0.3 percentage points to 2.3 percent. But they predicted a swift rebound that would return China and the global economy to their pre-crisis trends by midyear.
The sanguine forecasts are based in part on a disease outbreak from 2003: The Chinese economy recovered quickly after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another fatal flulike infection, temporarily emptied offices and factories.
But there is no guarantee that the coronavirus will trace a similar path. Already, there are indications that while the new virus is less lethal than SARS, it spreads more easily.
China’s $14 trillion economy also is four times as large as it was 17 years ago and far more globalized. About 150 million Chinese business executives and tourists took an international flight in 2018, the most recent data available, more than seven times the 2003 figure, according to JPMorgan. Globally, the number of shipping containers moving among the world’s ports has almost tripled, according to the United Nations.
In Youngstown, Ohio, Phantom Fireworks worries that a prolonged hiatus at its Chinese supplier may prevent it from importing sufficient inventory for the Independence Day celebration.
Though its vendor in Liuyang, about 200 miles from Wuhan, is scheduled to reopen on Feb. 10, Phantom executives say the shutdown will probably last at least an additional week and perhaps several more. Chinese officials also closed the southern port of Beihai late last week, severing a key export link. Few alternative producers exist outside China.
“We’re in a very precarious situation, no question about it,” said Alan Zoldan, the company’s executive vice president. “I’m not very confident at all. It’s pretty unprecedented territory.”
Precautions that the Chinese and American governments are taking to stop the spread of the coronavirus, justified on grounds of medical necessity, are raising the potential economic toll. An official quarantine will keep factories across much of China, closed since Jan. 24 for the Lunar New Year holiday, shut for at least one more week, maybe longer.
Three major U.S. airlines — United, American and Delta — suspended flights to China until the end of March. American grounded its planes immediately, one day after its flight attendants union sued the company, arguing that the virus made such trips unsafe. United and Delta will stop flying at the end of the week.
That means trans-Pacific airfreight shipments will be limited for at least two months even if Chinese factories return to normal operations before then. (Fed­Ex says that for now it is continuing its flights.) Some U.S. companies are drafting contingency plans for supply disruptions that linger into April or May, according to Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
China is the largest export destination for 33 countries and the top source of imported goods for 65, including the United States, according to a 2019 McKinsey Global Institute study.
The accumulating uncertainty is unnerving investors. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 600 points, or 2.1 percent, on Friday.
The U.S. dependence on China was on display two years ago when American companies first sought to dissuade the Trump administration from imposing tariffs on Chinese goods.
Among those lobbying for relief was GE, which relies on its Chinese factories for parts to produce CT scanners, ultrasound and X-ray machines, oil field pumps, valves and motors, and aircraft engine components.
“There are certain inputs that cannot be readily sourced outside China,” Del Renigar, a top official in GE’s Washington office, wrote to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
Finding a replacement for Chinese suppliers would not be easy. Dayco, a maker of engine parts and drive systems in Troy, Mich., said it would need two years to qualify new U.S. suppliers and to secure the needed approvals from its customers to use them.
Prinston Pharmaceuticals of Cranbury, N.J., depends on Chinese ingredients to make medications to treat high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s and depression. Novus Pharmaceuticals said its Chinese plant was the only source approved by the Food and Drug Administration for coartem tablets, a treatment for malaria.
Electronic component maker AVX of Fountain Inn, S.C., produces ceramic capacitors at its plants in Tianjin and Shenzhen, which its industrial customers in the United States use in automobiles, microwave ovens, washing machines, radios and television sets.
The impact of an interruption in Chinese supplies will depend on the duration of any cutoff, which is unknowable, and the size of current inventories, which companies generally do not disclose.
The number of people with the coronavirus has soared above 14,000, and more than 300 Chinese citizens have died. In response, Trump on Friday declared a public health emergency and barred foreign nationals who had been to China in the past 14 days from entering the United States. American citizens returning from the country will be subject to health screening and up to 14 days in quarantine.
The president’s decision came one day after the State Department warned U.S. citizens against all travel to China and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
China, which in recent years accounted for about one-third of global growth, is now radiating economic weakness. The immediate impact of the health crisis will slow its domestic economy. First-quarter growth will dip to an annual rate of 5.2 percent, down from 6 percent in the final three months of last year, the most abrupt slowdown in nearly 10 years, according to PNC Bank.
“It’ll bounce back when it’s over,” said Allen, the U.S.-China Business Council president. “But we don’t know when it will be over.”
Chinese consumers sheltering in their homes rather than engaging in traditional holiday activities will spend less, while factory closures affecting millions of workers threaten parts shortages for American electronics or auto plants, economists said.

"Feb 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-coronavirus-live-updates/2020/02/02/090d75d8-453d-11ea-99c7-1dfd4241a2fe_story.html,The Washington Post,Coronavirus infections predicted to grow exponentially; first death outside China; outbreak becomes political,"BEIJING — One nation after another is closing its doors to most Chinese travelers, as the death toll from the novel coronavirus continues to rise with no sign that the virus can be contained before it becomes a full-blown planetary health crisis. China's increasing isolation threatens to turn this new epidemic into a geopolitical conflict, intensifying preexisting tensions between China and the United States and having potentially significant impacts on the global economy.
At 5­ p.m. Sunday, the United States put into effect stringent travel restrictions on people coming from China. But the official edict of the Trump administration, announced Friday, led to confusion late Sunday about where, exactly, travelers from China deemed in need of quarantining would be screened and housed at or near the airports where they would be arriving.
The U.S. travel restrictions came in the wake of a report released late last week showing that the virus can be transmitted by someone who has not yet shown symptoms of an infection. At least a dozen countries have put travel restrictions on people coming from China. That list includes some neighboring countries that have closed their borders with China.
Such travel restrictions are contrary to public health recommendations and have riled Chinese government officials. The Foreign Ministry’s combative spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, singled out the United States, saying that the World Health Organization has said such restrictions are not necessary.
A “certain country has turned a blind eye to WHO recommendations and imposed sweeping travel restrictions against China,” Hua tweeted Saturday. “This kind of overreaction could only make things even worse. It’s not the right way to deal with the pandemic.”
Hua said many countries have offered China support, but in contrast, “certain U.S. officials’ words and actions are neither factual nor appropriate.” That appeared to be a reference to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who last week said the coronavirus could “help” to bring jobs to the United States as companies moved operations away from China. Hua said these “unfriendly U.S. comments” were “certainly not a gesture of goodwill.”
The coronavirus, which causes pneumonia-like symptoms, and for which there is no vaccine, was first identified in late December in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan. An early cluster of cases was found among people who had visited a seafood market where live animals were sold for consumption. Bats and the catlike civets have been linked to previous mutations in viruses that have jumped from animals to humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which began in southern China in 2002.
China’s National Health Commission reported Monday that there are now 17,205 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection on the mainland, plus 15 in Hong Kong and eight in Macao. The WHO reported 146 confirmed cases in 23 countries outside China. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday confirmed an additional case in California, involving a patient who had recently returned to the United States from Wuhan. That brings the U.S. case number to nine, with no deaths.
Scientists suspect the true number of infections may be many times higher than the official count. So far, 361 people have died, all but one in China.
The most serious illnesses appear to be in the elderly and people with preexisting medical problems, and it is highly contagious. Unless contained soon, it could become a pandemic — a disease that travels almost ­everywhere on the planet in the same manner as influenza.
The WHO on Sunday warned that the coronavirus is spreading not only disease, but also rumors, myths and misinformation.
“The 2019-nCoV outbreak and response has been accompanied by a massive ‘infodemic’ — an over-abundance of information — some accurate and some not — that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it,” the WHO wrote.
A report published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine documented a cluster of cases in Germany linked to a Chinese business traveler who showed no symptoms of disease when she was in Germany and became sick only when she returned home. The WHO, however, said this weekend that such transmission by an asymptomatic person is rare with coronaviruses. “Persons who are symptomatic will spread the virus more readily through coughing and sneezing,” the WHO wrote.

"Feb 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/03/why-we-should-be-wary-an-aggressive-government-response-coronavirus/,The Washington Post,Why we should be wary of an aggressive government response to coronavirus,"As the novel coronavirus has spread, so, too, has fear: Beijing has imposed a travel ban on 16 cities, quarantining more than 50 million people, and several countries, including Australia and Singapore, have also imposed travel restrictions. The World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern. Anti-Chinese sentiment, too, has spread rapidly: In France, a newspaper headline warned of a “Yellow Alert,” and restaurants in South Korea, Hong Kong and Vietnam have reportedly refused to serve Chinese customers. In the United States, customers are avoiding cities’ Chinatown neighborhoods, and students report anti-Chinese sentiment growing on their college campuses.
Initially, the U.S. government adopted a relatively measured response, even as political commentators and some members of Congress demanded that the United States ban all travel from China. It resisted travel bans in lieu of warning people to avoid nonessential travel to China and screening passengers from China at 20 international airports. Its decision Friday to deny entry to non-nationals who have recently traveled to China and quarantine Americans who are returning from that country marks a significant, and potentially counterproductive, escalation in the U.S. response to the coronavirus crisis.
Although this may assuage critics who insisted that the administration take more aggressive action, history and epidemiology warn us that such measures are unlikely to work. Respiratory diseases are not easily contained by travel bans or quarantines. Rather than contain an epidemic, harsh, coercive policies often scapegoat already-marginalized populations and intensify panic rather than quell it.
History offers ample reasons to be wary that authorities may resort to discriminatory measures in the face of a frightening disease. When bubonic plague came to San Francisco in 1900, for example, the city twice enacted racially motivated, scientifically dubious measures. First, health officials required that Asian residents be inoculated with an experimental vaccine before traveling outside the city. After a federal court, in a rare example of judicial intervention during a public health panic, struck down that measure, the city established a quarantine around a neighborhood where many Chinese residents lived, enforcing it only against Chinese residents. That quarantine was also found to be unconstitutionally discriminatory. Decades later, HIV similarly provoked discrimination against groups perceived to be at the highest risk. As children such as Ryan White were kept out of school and well-known commentators demanded widespread quarantine, the Coast Guard picked up asylum-seeking Haitians and quarantined them at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Given that HIV was already widespread, as Judy Rabinovitz, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, noted at the time, “there can be no pretense that this can be to the public health benefit of the United States.”
Our nation’s most recent disease panic further illustrates what can go wrong when fear rather than science drives the government’s response to an outbreak. In 2014, when Liberian citizen Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola while visiting relatives in Dallas, and two nurses treating Duncan contracted the illness, a full-blown panic erupted; demand for coercive responses grew. Despite assurances by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that blood and other bodily fluids were the primary modes of transmission, the news media fueled public fear about casual transmission. Governors responded by quarantining travelers who exhibited no symptoms of Ebola. Although she was not infected, Kaci Hickox, a nurse, was involuntarily detained in a tent outside Newark International Airport after arriving from West Africa, where she had treated patients. After Hickox told her story to the media, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) allowed her to travel to Maine, where state officials sought to quarantine her. A federal court later dismissed her constitutional challenge to New Jersey’s actions, and a federal court in Connecticut likewise dismissed a case brought by several people quarantined in that state. (An appeal of that case is pending.)
The Ebola scare had lasting implications for how the federal government might respond to future outbreaks. In 2017, the CDC published new federal quarantine regulations. Federal law had long given CDC broad powers to restrict international and interstate travel and apprehend and detain people who are thought to have a quarantinable disease (a designation established by presidential order). Despite the breadth of that authority, the CDC had generally left infection control, at least within the country, to state and local health departments. Indeed, the CDC’s own prior quarantine regulations were remarkably thin, offering little guidance as to when and how the agency should exercise its authority. The updated regulations provide far greater specificity, authorizing the CDC to collect detailed information about travelers’ health status, and detain or bar travel (including interstate travel) of people who have — or are “reasonably believed” to be infected with — a quarantinable disease. The level of detail in these provisions appeared to signal that the CDC was prepared to assume a more robust domestic rule in future outbreaks, as it did last week
The regulations also created several layers of internal administrative review. Critics, including one of us, worried that the due-process review provisions were inadequate, allowing people to be detained for relatively long periods while the review proceeded. In addition, the regulations do not provide for review by an independent decision-maker. They also do not limit detentions and travel bans to situations in which they are the least restrictive alternative, a standard that some courts have held to be constitutionally compelled. Also absent are protections from deportation and income replacement for people who are quarantined. Both protections may be critical to ensuring that people are willing to comply rather than seek to evade quarantine orders. In addition to these lapses, the regulations have few safeguards to prevent federal officials from wielding their public health powers in ineffective, potentially abusive ways. And as the Ebola lawsuits show, the public cannot count on the courts to protect them from public health overreaches. When panic strikes, judges are often loath to intervene.
What, then, can protect us from plagues and panics? Although there are no simple panaceas, there are two durable antidotes. One is a strong and resilient health-care system that the public can easily access, and in which public health laboratories and hospitals have a strong surge capacity. Unfortunately, as hospitals close and the number of uninsured Americans increases, our health-care system is facing significant strains. The other is trust: In times of peril, it’s critical that the public have faith in the expertise and good intentions of health officials. When officials are distrusted, or rumors are given as much credence as expert advice, panic is likely to worsen, increasing the chance that the authorities may impose ineffective, discriminatory policies.
Unfortunately, the latter antidote may be in especially short supply today. Although overall trust in science remains high, faith in government is perilously low. As scientists are leaving the federal government, well known and trusted voices in public health are missing. Meanwhile, partisanship and tribalism seem to exert more and more influence on how Americans view the challenges we face as a nation. In such an atmosphere, public health officials may lack the tools to calm the public and guide it through a health crisis. That, in turn, may enhance the risk that they will employ coercive and discriminatory measures, based more on fear of others than on epidemiological best practices. If history is any guide, such efforts are doomed to make a bad situation worse."
"Feb 4, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/02/03/what-travelers-should-know-about-face-masks-amid-growing-coronavirus-concerns/,The Washington Post,What travelers should know about face masks amid growing coronavirus concerns,"The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now responsible for 17,228 confirmed cases in China, reported by the country’s National Health Commission on Monday, and confirmed cases of the strain in 23 countries outside China, according to the World Health Organization. As with any outbreak, global travelers have the risk of exposure on their minds — as evidenced by masks on their faces. Passing through any international terminal as of late, it’s impossible to ignore a sizable uptick in self-imposed muzzlings. They represent not just wary passengers but also airport staff, flight attendants and ground crew.
The practice remains unadvised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: “CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks among the general public,” reads the most up-to-date FAQ on the federal agency’s website. But that hasn’t stopped travelers from stocking up: Amazon is temporarily sold out of many of its top-selling disposable varieties; they’re easily spotted on faces in airports across the world.
How truly effective are masks, and when should people consider donning them? We queried a wide range of medical professionals on the matter to see what travelers should know in the wake of the outbreak.
“The regular kind of mask you’d find online is not all that helpful against any kind of virus,” warns Amy Shah, a double board-certified medical doctor in allergy and immunology. “Is it bad? No. It’s not like it’s harmful. But will it completely protect you? No. The best thing you can do is wash your hands frequently — with water and antibacterial soap for at least 20 seconds — and to keep your immune system up,” she says.
To that end, she offers disposable gloves as a more effective form of prevention when traveling than the stereotypical surgical mask. And as a more practical measure, she suggests assisting self-defense with lots of vitamin C in the form of food.
“Leafy greens are a great source, more so than eating a ton of oranges,” she says. “Turmeric and vitamin D also work as immune-boosters.”

Thank you very much. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States...
(APPLAUSE)
... and my fellow citizens, three years ago we launched the great American comeback.
TRUMP: Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring. Poverty is plummeting. Crime is falling. Confidence is surging. And our country is thriving and highly respected again.
(APPLAUSE)
America's enemies are on the run. America's fortunes are on the rise. And America's future is blazing bright. The years of economic decay are over.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us.
(APPLAUSE)
Gone, too, are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige. In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of Americans’ destiny.
TRUMP: We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.
(APPLAUSE)
I amthrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. Our borders are secure, our families are flourishing, our values are renewed, our pride is restored. And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress: The state of our union is stronger than ever before.
(APPLAUSE)
The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society, one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise.
From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy, slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements.
(APPLAUSE)
Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high. Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration.
(APPLAUSE)
The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.
(APPLAUSE)
And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. True.
(APPLAUSE)
If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: The unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history.
(APPLAUSE)
African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.
(APPLAUSE)
African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.
(APPLAUSE)
The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years, and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.
(APPLAUSE)
The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low.
(APPLAUSE)
The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history.
(APPLAUSE)
A record number of young Americans are now employed.
(APPLAUSE)
Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.
(APPLAUSE)
In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people, working-age people, have joined the workforce.
(APPLAUSE)
Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent, three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent.
(APPLAUSE)
After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election.
(APPLAUSE)
This is a blue-collar boom.
(APPLAUSE)
Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded.
(APPLAUSE)
Since my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible. This is a record. It is something that every country in the world is looking up to. They admire.
(APPLAUSE)
Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs. All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before, with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, and even more.
Jobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods, thanks to opportunity zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts.
(APPLAUSE)
In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven't seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement.
(APPLAUSE)
This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It’s all working. Opportunity zones are helping Americans, like Army Veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family. He was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in opportunity zones.
TRUMP: He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony, keep up the great work. Tony.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you, Tony.
Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law. Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.
(APPLAUSE)
Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere the world, by far.
(APPLAUSE)
With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high.
(APPLAUSE)
We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago. Likewise, we are restoring our nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done.
After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built.
(APPLAUSE)
Companies are not leaving. They are coming back to the USA.
(APPLAUSE)
The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, the place where the action is.
One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal.
(APPLAUSE)
In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for president. Following NAFTA's adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so and then absolutely nothing happened.
But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. We did our job.
(APPLAUSE)
Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers.
(APPLAUSE)
It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity. We will have that. Fairness and reciprocity. And I say that finally, because it's been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions.
(APPLAUSE)
I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of America's jobs. Our strategy has worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA.
(APPLAUSE)
For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States. Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we've done because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, ""That's enough.""
(APPLAUSE)
Now we want to rebuild our country, and that's exactly what we're doing. We are rebuilding our country.
As we restore...
(APPLAUSE)
... American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere.
(APPLAUSE)
That's why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba.
(APPLAUSE)
We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro.
(APPLAUSE)
Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans.
Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate president of Venezuela, Juan Guaido.
(APPLAUSE)
Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you, Mr. President. Great honor. Thank you very much.
Please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you very much.
Socialism destroys nations. But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul.
(APPLAUSE)
To safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment, and it's all made right here in the USA.
(APPLAUSE)
We are also getting our allies finally to help pay their fair share.
(APPLAUSE)
I have raised contributions from other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled.
And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces. It's called the Space Force.
(APPLAUSE)
Very important.
(APPLAUSE)
In the gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman, and what he wants so badly, 13 years old, Iain Lanphier, he’s an eighth-grader from Arizona. Iain, please stand up.
Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, ""Most people look up at space; I want to look down on the world.""
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
But sitting beside Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen -- the first black fighter pilots -- and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather.
(APPLAUSE)
Incredible story. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday.
(APPLAUSE)
A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee, our nation salutes you. Thank you, sir.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: From the pilgrims to the founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future.
Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people.
(APPLAUSE)
The people are the heart of our country. Their dreams are the soul of our country. And their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first."

David Abel and his wife, Sally, are still smiling, for now. Their friends Alan and Wendy Steele are going ""stir crazy"" trapped in their cabin — although they say they are not worried about catching the deadly illness. Still, this was not how the Steeles planned to spend their honeymoon.
Many of the 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members on the Diamond Princess are struggling to keep their spirits up after the luxury liner was quarantined off the Japanese coast Wednesday, with passengers forbidden to leave their cabins.
“We’ve got two weeks’ extra cruise, albeit a confined cruise,” David Abel, 74, said on a Skype call from his cabin. “You’ve got to make the best of the situation, haven’t you? But I’m sure that in 10 or 12 days’ time, I’ll be pulling my hair out.”
Last Saturday, a man from Hong Kong who had spent five days aboard the ship and disembarked was confirmed as having contracted the coronavirus. On Wednesday, with the ship docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan’s Health Ministry said nine other passengers and one Filipino crew member had tested positive. By early Thursday, the ship’s total confirmed cases rose to 20 after officials said 10 more people had tested positive, while 171 were awaiting test results.
The nine passengers who tested positive on Wednesday — two Australians, three from Japan, three from Hong Kong, and one American — have been transferred to hospitals, but none is in serious condition, said Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato.
For those left on board, there is nothing to do but sit in their cabins, wait for meals to be delivered, watch television or choose from a limited selection of movies on demand. Those lucky enough to have a balcony can at least sit in the sun, look at the ocean and talk to their neighbors.
“But you’re not getting anything really positive or encouraging talking to them,” Abel quipped. “It’s all doom and gloom as far as they’re concerned.”
Abel said his greatest sympathy is with those confined to the inside cabins.
“Can you imagine? It would be liked being locked in a wardrobe, wouldn’t it?” he said. “No fresh air. No natural light. It really must be a living hell for them.”
Other passengers tweeting from the ship or talking to Japanese media showed the anxiety on board.
“Still shocked and scared. But better precautions. Have faith in the crews and captain,” tweeted Yardley Wong, who describes herself as a Christian entrepreneur from Hong Kong.
Life on board had been winding down Tuesday as medical staff went through the boat interviewing and testing passengers, with the casino closed and the evening’s main entertainment show canceled.
But guests still gathered for dinner, and smaller events continued where passengers mingled, hours before the captain ordered all passengers to go to their cabins and stay there.
A person with the Twitter handle @daxa_tw and tweeting in Japanese has been posting videos and photos of life on board the Diamond Princess.
“As for myself, I am going to assume that I have already been infected,” he tweeted.
In a direct message, he said he feared the number of infected people could grow significantly, “because this is a cruise whose main purpose is socializing.”
“Whether the quarantine was going on or not, it didn’t matter. Lots of events were offered. Dinner last night was just as it usually is,” he said. “I’m not worried. I just want to go home soon.”
Calls to room service go unanswered as crew members struggle to deliver basic meals. That means passengers cannot get an alcoholic drink.
Breakfast for many arrived about 11 a.m. — a problem for Abel, who has diabetes and needs to eat regularly to maintain his blood-sugar levels. Passengers had received just one cup of coffee by early afternoon.
On orders of Japan’s Health Ministry, they have been told they are not allowed to smoke, a problem for Wendy Steele, a 51-year-old nurse from Wolverhampton in Britain.
“That’s crucifying me,” she said.
The Steeles were married last month; the cruise around Asia was their honeymoon. Now, Wendy faces celebrating her 52nd birthday on Feb. 11 confined to her cabin. Alan, 58, was due to start a new job as a driver on Feb. 10, but his employer will have to wait.
For lunch, they were sent stale bread with ham, he said, a far cry from the meals that had been offered throughout the cruise.
“We’re basically being treated like we’re prisoners and criminals at the moment; that’s how we feel,” he said. “There’s nothing coming down the tannoy telling us when we’re going to be released onto the ship,” he added, referring to the public address system.
The pair said they were relying on the Internet and messages from fellow passengers to find out what was happening. They nevertheless stressed that the crew has been “amazing.”
Aside from going stir crazy, they said they were not worried about catching the virus, because they had socialized on board mainly with the Abels and an Irish couple, dining together every night, and none had fallen sick.
Negin Kamali, a public relations officer for Princess Cruise Lines, which is owned by British-American cruise operator Carnival, said the onboard guest experience team was working on developing “in-cabin activities and entertainment,” adding that the passengers will be allowed to leave the boat after 14 days.
David Abel, who has started a business in his retirement as a wedding celebrant, has been on about 20 cruises with his wife. He said they have three more lined up this year, when they plan to celebrate their 50th anniversary.
They are missing their family and their dogs, two Yorkshire terriers, back home in Northamptonshire. But this experience, he said, won’t put them off.
“We really love our cruises,” he said. This one, their first in Asia, took them to Vietnam, Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as Japan. “I have really, really enjoyed the cruise. I would love to come back and spend another week or so in Taiwan.”

"Feb 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/as-anger-explodes-over-doctors-death-beijing-firm-gives-chinese-government-advice/2020/02/08/6899e3e6-4a52-11ea-9164-d3154ad8a5cd_story.html,The Washington Post,"As anger explodes over doctor’s death, Beijing firm gives Chinese government advice","BEIJING — When sorrow and rage erupted on China's Internet early Friday after the Wuhan ""whistleblower doctor"" Li Wenliang succumbed to the coronavirus, many political observers saw one of the biggest challenges to the Communist Party in years.
In Beijing, Qi Zhongxiang saw an opportunity.
Within 24 hours, Qi and his 150-person company, Womin Technology, quickly compiled a “public sentiment” report drawing on posts from more than 100 social media sources and submitted it, along with their recommendations, to the Communist Party’s central leadership.
The seven-page document, which was reviewed by The Washington Post, analyzed the intensity of public outrage over Li, who was muzzled by Wuhan police after he tried to spread word about the coronavirus in December. It recommended that the Party leadership “affirm” the doctor’s contributions while stepping up efforts to block harmful speech and “divert” the public’s attention with positive news.
It predicted, finally, that there was “low probability” of street gatherings but warned local authorities to be on guard to “deal decisively” with any unrest.
As the document surfaced online early Saturday, many Chinese Internet users condemned the company for offering such services to the government. In an interview, Qi said he was surprised the document leaked, but defended his work as a public service and said it was demonstration of his company’s capabilities.
“Anger is the emotion with the strongest transmissibility. You have to understand how it gets formed, then you resolve the issues one-by-one,” he said, adding he was not paid by the government. “We have nothing to hide with our work.”
It is unclear whether Party officials paid any heed to Womin’s advice, but the report — and the public anger surrounding it — touched upon two truths of today’s China: With opportunities for mobilizing and gathering increasingly restricted, particularly during a nationwide epidemic, politics is increasingly playing out in cyberspace. As a result, the techno-authoritarian government needs precisely the kind of insights Qi provides to maintain its rule.
Qi, a 46-year-old entrepreneur who founded Womin in 2007, said he could not provide proof that his work was influencing policy, but he has been submitting similar reports during national crises for years to high-placed friends inside the Party. He would not say who.
According to his company bio, Qi has been invited to make reports before the Communist Party Central Committee’s General Office, which within the Chinese system is headed by a Party official that is equivalent to the White House chief of staff.
Qi said he mostly has financial sector clients and only submits public sentiment reports to officials during extraordinary crises such as China’s stock market plunge in 2015. His company has access to more than 100 sources of social media data, including Facebook and Twitter and other services nominally banned in mainland China, he said.
Online, Chinese netizens were not impressed. Some called Womin a “public enemy” for offering its services to the government and recommending more censorship. Others called the company a joke.
Qi said his company only recommended blocking rumors and harmful information. “Most people I’m aware of believe our recommendations are reasonable,” he said. “The government collects information and then makes an informed decision about how to act. We just try to capture reality as best as we can.”
Qi said he recommended the government match its actions with the public’s expectations and try to hold officials accountable. The Communist Party on Friday did just that, dispatching anticorruption investigators — an arm of the party generally held in high regard by the public — to look for signs of wrongdoing in the events that led to Li’s death.
Grief, anger and fear accounted for 72, 14 and 8 percent of the responses in the hours after Li’s death first trickled out, according to Womin’s analysis. Posts about the doctor soon blanketed social media and peaked at 11 p.m. Thursday night before dropping precipitously by 5 a.m. — possibly as Internet censors revved up.
The report noted that most of the social media anger was directed at government officials’ “dereliction of duty” and the fact that Wuhan police detained Li in January, which possibly contributed to the epidemic’s spread.
But there were other trends, it noted: “All kinds of people domestic and overseas who are not satisfied with the Chinese political system are using the opportunity to foment and push this case.”
Qi said Womin did not just study social media sentiment on domestic issues. Many of his clients turn to him for insights on matters like the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. (“Trump will definitely win unless he has health problems,” he predicted.)
Womin employs many computer science engineers and sociologists, said Qi, who graduated with a philosophy degree from Beijing Normal University. The company is also advised by prominent Princeton sociologist Yu Xie, who is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, as well as the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. In emails, Xie said he did not work on Womin’s latest report. He said he previously provided consultation but was never hired by the company.
The company has also received investment from Tencent — the owner of WeChat — and participated in the Internet giant’s start-up incubator program.
Qi said he felt only pride for his firm.
“We have people who study communications. We have people with military backgrounds,” he said. “We have a very complete team. There is not another company in China with capabilities like ours.”"
"Feb 9, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-good-and-bad-times-africas-biggest-airline-ethiopian-sticks-by-chinas-side/2020/02/09/67155ffc-4762-11ea-91ab-ce439aa5c7c1_story.html,The Washington Post,"‘In good and bad times’: Africa’s biggest airline, Ethiopian, sticks by China’s side","ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — As dozens of airlines around the world forgo massive profits and suspend flights to China amid fears of spreading the new coronavirus, Africa's biggest airline continues to transport thousands from China every day.
Ethio­pian Airlines has become the loudest proponent of sticking by China and keeping trade links open. Six other African airlines, including Kenya Airways and South African Airways, have suspended their flights.
“Ethiopian Airlines serves countries in good and bad times,” the airline’s chief executive, Tewolde Gebremariam, told local media in Ethi­o­pia this weekend. “China has a strong trade and investment relationship with Africa, and Ethiopian Airlines is the major carrier that links China with many African countries. If we stop flights to China, we break that relationship.”
While no coronavirus case has been confirmed on the continent, jitters have spread as preparedness to test for the disease has only slowly ramped up and the economy of China, Africa’s biggest trading partner, has taken a huge hit.
“Today, if we are not going to fly to China, China and Africa are going to be completely disconnected,” Tewolde said. “We have to take maximum precautions, but stopping flights is not one of them.”
The World Health Organization — headed by Ethio­pian Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus — has not advised airlines to withdraw flights to China. Tewolde said his decisions followed global guidelines. Health and passport screenings at the airline’s hub in Addis Ababa, he said, were stringent enough to catch suspected cases before people entered Ethiopia or transited to other African countries as most of the airline’s passengers do.
The assurances did little to assuage doubts, even among African leaders. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta made a public plea to Ethio­pian Airlines while visiting Washington last week. He said the need to protect the health of Kenyans went beyond Kenya’s economic relationship with China.
“Our worry as a country is not that China cannot manage the disease. Our biggest worry is diseases coming into areas with weaker health systems like ours,” he said. “It has nothing to do with our relationship with any country. It’s about protecting our people from the risk of infection.”
Estimates of how many Chinese citizens live in Africa range from 200,000 to 2 million, and the influence of loans and investments by China’s government and state-owned companies is visible in most African countries, where they have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure and manufacturing projects.

More than a quarter of China’s global construction projects in recent years have been in Africa, said Deborah Brautigam, director of the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. That has caused at least some of China’s partners in Africa to think twice before taking actions that might impede economic ties.
“In Africa, they’re just not seeing a reason yet to disrupt the business with a major economic partner,” Brautigam said.
Economists in Africa warned that the continent’s dependence on China means any downturn there would eventually reach these shores.
“By all accounts, any slowdown in Chinese economic activity is bound to have a material impact on Africa,” said Zemedeneh Negatu, an Ethio­pian business adviser who has consulted for Ethio­pian Airlines.
“Last year, China-Africa trade was around $200 billion, mostly in oil, iron, copper and other raw commodities,” he said. “There are already indications that the Chinese economy will grow at less than 5 percent this year, which means demand from China will be substantially reduced. If the outbreak is prolonged, you will see the impacts very clearly in Africa.”
Spokesmen for three of the eastern African seaboard’s biggest ports, in Djibouti; Mombasa, Kenya; and Beira, Mozambique, said shipping from China hadn’t declined yet, but because container vessels move slowly, the effects of several port closures in China would be felt in Africa in a few weeks.

John Ashbourne, an analyst at Capital Economics who specializes in Africa, said some of the economic wounds, such as airline cancellations, are defensive or self-inflicted. Mauritius, for instance, banned the entry of Chinese nationals even though it owes a few percentage points of its economy to Chinese tourists.
“Realistically, the harm caused by an outbreak is caused by the responses, rather than by the virus itself: travel bans, factory shutdowns, business limitations,” he said.
Business continued apace at Chinatowns in Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Dakar, Senegal. Reporters found business owners and patrons complaining that hysteria around the virus had kept some customers away but inspired a we’ll-get-through-this-together attitude in others.
Ma Quin, a 25-year-old accountant for a fishing company who moved from Beijing to Dakar last month, said his boss told staffers to start wearing face masks. Other than that, he said, the firm hasn’t changed anything because of the outbreak.
“I’m worried when I travel,” Ma said between sips of egg drop soup at a Chinese lunch spot, “but I feel safe here.”
People in Senegal treat him and his colleagues like human beings, he said — not walking contagions.
“I hear about racism against the Chinese in Europe,” he said. But Africa “can’t afford to close all doors to China.”

This matters. Local bodies hold the key to lasting solutions for a broader crisis of financial resources.
The federal government’s chronic deficits dominate discussions about India’s precarious public finances. It’s time to flip this New Delhi-centric approach. State government accounts deserve scrutiny because they collectively spend 36% more than the federal administration. Yet their fundraising abilities are limited. Of the 24 trillion rupees ($340 billion) that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s team hopes to pull in via taxes in the coming fiscal year, less than a third is intended for the states. A 20% jump looks impressive only because this year’s transfer saw a 14% squeeze from the previous.
Formerly known as Bombay, the capital of the western state of Maharashtra faces a further crunch. Centered on seven Arabian Sea islands that Portuguese colonizers handed to the British in 1662, modern Mumbai has expanded into independent India’s pulsating trading and financial center, a cosmopolitan agglomeration of 26 million people — twice as populous as business hubs like Hong Kong and Singapore combined. 
The birthplace of Bollywood boasts the country’s priciest real estate, but the property market is toast, in part because a shadow-banking meltdown choked developers’ access to finance. With unsold homes piling up, Mumbai can’t earn much from homeowners or builders. Up to 34% of the municipality’s recently announced 334 billion-rupee annual budget will rely on compensation. This was offered in 2017 by the federal government to get state and municipalities to agree to scrap inefficient indirect taxes — in Mumbai’s case, a levy on merchandise entering the city for sale — in favor of a nationwide goods and services tax.
GST was a major reform, but awkwardly designed and poorly implemented. Its failure weakened federal finances, though Modi at least has access to the central bank’s printing press. A bigger challenge has opened up at the subnational level. As Mumbai real-estate analyst Vishal Bhargava notes, the city’s compensation deal ends in 2022. Its revenue will fall to what it was a decade ago, only facing higher costs. The authority is already dipping into reserves to meet pension obligations; a further income shock will be a disaster.
Every year, Mumbai’s creaking infrastructure faces a huge risk from flash floods. Yet such are the funding constraints that a city of tycoons, bankers and movie stars — who live alongside masses huddled in shantytowns — can allocate only 9 billion rupees of capital expenditure on storm drains, a fifth of what the civic body will spend on employee pensions. 
India’s richest metropolis opens a window on the crippling lack of basic services in smaller cities, towns and villages where 1.3 billion people live. New Delhi, the capital, is at least contained in a mini-state, which gives the city access to a more diversified resource pool, such as taxes on petroleum products. But New Delhi’s air quality is foul. Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, is running out of water. Software powerhouse Bangalore, which has lost its entire greenery to urbanization, punishes commuters with the worst traffic congestion in the world. 
The solutions are known. The shallow municipal bond markets must scale up, but that will require cities to adopt internationally acceptable accounting, create own sources of revenue, and bring down endemic corruption. The GST needs to be overhauled so that overall tax collection, which Team Modi expects to rise by 12% next fiscal year, doesn’t repeat this year’s paltry 4% increase.
As the pie grows, distribution must also be fair. A commission that sets the formula for resource-sharing is proposing to leave the states’ portion broadly unchanged at 41%. But as I said, in reality, states are getting less than a third of what New Delhi collects. A lot of taxation now takes place in the form of targeted levies on education, health and sanitation, kept in full by the federal administration. A new bargain between different levels of the government must change this. 
At 70% of GDP, India’s overall government debt — at all levels — is too high for an investment-grade sovereign. Without bumping up local capital spending, people’s incomes and their ability to pay taxes and fees won’t rise fast enough to reduce national debt.Weak national finances will leave India unprepared to deal with climate change and epidemics. The coronavirus isn’t a big headache for India, at least not yet. It’s the next outbreak that planners must worry about. Setting aside more money for drains, sewage management and hospitals will better protect citizens and economic assets. The money circulating in the economy because of municipal-level spending will ease India’s fiscal crisis.
Will it happen? Take Mumbai again. Shiv Sena, the homegrown right-wing party in control of the municipal corporation since 1985, was a long-time ally of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party until it broke ranks last year. It  now leads a coalition controlling the entire state. The Shiv Sena leader, Uddhav Thackeray, has hinted at pulling the plug on a Japanese-funded high-speed train link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad in Modi’s home state, Gujarat, which is promoting a Mumbai-rivaling international financial center.For India’s fiscal balance to regain its footing, the economics of public spending will have to become more local. Politics already is. "
"Feb 12, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/under-armours-new-ceo-makes-an-ugly-start/2020/02/11/a3fede46-4cf5-11ea-967b-e074d302c7d4_story.html,The Washington Post,Under Armour’s New CEO Makes an Ugly Start,"Any new chief executive likes to make their own mark. For Patrik Frisk, who took the helm of Under Armour Inc. last month, there’s even more reason than most. While founder Kevin Plank has ceded the role of CEO, he’s staying around as chairman and brand chief at the maker of athletic apparel.
At first glance, the surprise sales and profit warning that Frisk, who spent two-and-a-half years as chief operating officer, announced on Tuesday, looks like the last thing he would have wanted to unleash on investors during his first update. And that’s not all: Under Armour is also considering another restructuring,
To be fair, some of the cut to revenue guidance is down to the coronavirus –  a risk shared with rivals Nike Inc. and Adidas AG. But it is also due to a decline in sales in North America, where efforts to rein in discounting and concentrate on the style, fit and performance of apparel have taken longer to bear fruit. Profit estimates were also lowered: The mid-point of the $105 million to $125 million range would imply a halving of operating earnings from 2019, according analysts at Bernstein.
The big downgrade is clearly unwelcome to investors, who may be forgiven for thinking they have been here before. The group has been restructuring, including cutting jobs, for the past three years. However, such a dramatic lowering of guidance does provides more leeway to try to fix the U.S. business, where more work is clearly needed, and potentially scope to outperform later on.  
There were some bright spots. Under Armour’s gross margin, which expanded by 1.8 percentage points in 2019, is forecast to widen by another 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point this year. Inventories are also falling, and the wholesale market is showing signs of stabilizing.
Under Armour’s reduced outlook also paves the way for more cost-cutting. Taking an ax to expenditure could lead to savings of $30 million to $50 million in 2020, even though this could cost as much as $425 million in pre-tax charges. Of this, $225 million to $250 million relates to the possibility of foregoing opening a flagship store in New York. Pausing this project looks wise given the outlook. So Frisk may be erring on the side of caution as he takes the reins.
But there’s still considerable uncertainty as to whether Under Armour’s strategy  —  focused foremost on performance rather than fashion —  will pay off. Meanwhile, competition from Nike and Adidas isn’t getting any easier, with the latter pushing ahead with its collaboration with Beyonce. Add in a federal investigation into Under Armour’s accounting practices, and whether Plank will be able to relinquish some control and the outlook remains highly uncertain.
After under-promising, Frisk has little choice but to over-deliver."
"Feb 12, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/sometimes-a-billionaire-just-needs-a-volvo/2020/02/11/89472cda-4d26-11ea-967b-e074d302c7d4_story.html,The Washington Post,Sometimes a Billionaire Just Needs a Volvo,"Chinese billionaire Li Shufu is bringing his cash cow in-house. Let’s hope he doesn’t milk it dry.
Volvo Car AB and Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. have said in a statement that they’re considering merging their businesses in a combined entity that would tap capital markets through Hong Kong and Stockholm. The parent company that they share, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., is run by the ambitious Mr. Li, who seems to be taking a big first step toward consolidating his sprawling holdings. 
Other moves, such as a spinoff, had already been signaled. In a bond prospectus dated November, Geely Automobile said that Volvo and the parent intended to merge operations into a standalone business to develop “next generation combustion engines and hybrid powertrains.” Volvo Car said this would clear the way for it to focus on developing all-electric premium vehicles.Li has spent billions buying or building stakes in the likes of Mercedes Benz-maker Daimler AG, Volvo AB and Lotus Cars Ltd. through to flying-car maker Terrafugia Inc. He was recently reported to be in the running to make an investment in Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc. Until now, he’s kept them separate but under his holding company.
Bringing the Swedish and Chinese car companies under the same umbrella makes sense at first glance. Volvo Car’s stable profits ($5.5 billion in 2019) could offset the tough terrain that Geely faces in China’s shrinking car market. The two already collaborate through a joint venture on the Lynk & Co. brand. Since the parent bought Volvo in 2010, Geely’s cars have received an upgrade after it set up the joint China-Euro Vehicle Technology AB research and development center. There’s also a case for cost sharing. Volvo is focused on the higher- and greener-end of the car spectrum. Geely hasn’t quite gotten there. That will help as China pushes forward with its electric car ambitions.
The pair said in their statement that the merger would “accelerate financial and technological synergies” and create a strong global group. So, let’s talk about the finances. To build up his empire, Li has piled on leverage at the Zhejiang Geely holding company level. Net debt stood at $8.1 billion at the end of September, more than double from a year prior. It needs to service that debt while feeding and funding its ambitions. S&P Global Ratings expects the company’s leverage to increase this year as volumes and margins contract.
Volvo has been a cash source for its parent. In 2019, Volvo paid out dividends of 2.9 billion kronor ($306 million), with 2.8 billion kronor of that to its parent. That was higher than the first dividends paid out in 2016. Volvo injected 1.15 billion kronor into another jointly-owned Geely brand, Polestar Group, last year. Related-party transactions with the Geely sphere of companies totaled 4.1 billion kronor in 2019.
Geely has held up relative to its auto-making peers, but earnings have been shrinking as sales in the world’s largest car market deteriorate. Its ability to spend and stay ahead of the technology curve are also constrained. It shelled out $423 million on capital expenditures in the 12 months to June last year, compared to Volvo’s $1.25 billion in 2019. It’s clear who will be driving once they come together.
The parent company will keep its firm grip. Through connected transactions, it holds the licenses that Geely uses to manufacture the cars in China. Because of this structure, Geely can make and sell cars there while holding 99% stakes in operating subsidiaries, despite its offshore incorporation, according to Moody’s Investors Service Inc.
Li needs this merger to work. With the coronavirus potentially wreaking operational havoc, the parent company has to be in financial order. A blockbuster valuation will help fund his future ambitions in a tougher global auto industry and pay down the debt he’s built up.  What better way than to create an improved asset in the new entity, give it a boost with your crown jewel, Volvo, and monetize it. A more valuable asset makes for better collateral.  Li will look  to maximize the efficiency of his capital.
Geely, with an enterprise value of around $16 billion, trades at 7.2 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. It’s sitting on cash of around $2 billion and very little debt. Volvo generated $3.2 billion of Ebitda in 2019. Assuming a multiple of 2.5 times earnings, around that of other European carmakers, would value the Swedish company at around $8 billion. The valuation of the combined entity will be higher. Even two years ago, Volvo was looking for a valuation of double that on the lower end to as much as $30 billion when talk of going public alone surfaced.  
Wherever the valuation comes out and whatever shareholders are willing to digest, let’s hope there are indeed synergies and Geely isn’t drawing too much out of Volvo Cars. That may defeat the purpose of Li’s entire exercise."

Is zero low enough? OK, how about we pay you to take it off our hands?
That’s what’s happening in the middle of the U.S. shale patch at the moment — and it’s a symptom of a glut that could reshape energy markets across the world in the coming years.
Gas prices at the Waha hub in Texas’s Permian basin fell to minus 26.8 cents per million British thermal units this week. They’re heading in an even more “aggressively negative” direction, commodities broker OTC Global Holdings told Bloomberg News, as a shortage of pipeline capacity makes producers jostle for a place in the queue.
Selling a commodity for a negative price isn’t quite as crazy as it sounds. Indeed, it’s a relatively common occurrence. Fuel oil — the gloopy fraction of crude used by boilers in ships, buildings and power stations — has hardly ever earned positive margins for refiners. Instead, they aim to make their money on gasoline and diesel, treating fuel oil as a waste product from which they can extract a few extra dollars.
That’s the current situation with natural gas in the U.S. A growing proportion of output is produced not for its own sake but as a byproduct from shale oil fields, where operators don’t care about the price of gas as long as it doesn’t stop them earning a positive margin on their crude production.
Output of this so-called associated gas has increased nearly fourfold from 4.3 billion cubic feet per day in 2006 to 15 billion in 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration, making up about 37% of shale gas production and 12% of total U.S. gas output. 
With this super-cheap gas meeting the first leg of demand, the price at which the entire gas market clears is being driven lower. Thanks in part to an unusually mild winter, the Henry Hub U.S. gas benchmark has fallen by more than a third since its usual early-winter peak at the start of November, hitting its lowest level since 2016 this week.
Even this effect would have been a strictly local issue a few years ago — but as the global liquefied natural gas industry grows up, that’s changing, too. Traditionally gas prices in different regions had little relationship with each other, but the situation is giving way to one where the cost of U.S. exports, plus a margin for transport and conversion to and from LNG, is increasingly setting a unified global price.
That’s likely to shake up many long-standing assumptions about the market. Asia has been mostly immune to the switch of coal-fired generation to gas which, along with the headlong growth of renewables, has caused the rapid shutdown of coal fleets in the U.S. and Europe.
Without the significant domestic gas reserves seen in those regions, prices in Asia simply haven’t been competitive enough. Except for brief periods in summer when gas demand is low, the Japan-Korea Marker gas benchmark has historically mostly priced its energy content at about twice what you’d pay for the same heating value of coal at China’s Qinhuangdao port. 
That’s flipped so dramatically in recent months that even imported gas is now cheaper than coal on a heating value basis. When you take into account the greater efficiency with which most gas plants convert the energy in their fuel into electricity, the discount is even more pronounced. Any utilities expecting current low prices to be sustained ought to be looking hard at switching away from solid to gaseous carbon for any generation that renewables can’t easily supply.
There’s good reason to think this glut isn’t going away. China, a major driver of Asian gas demand in recent years, may be coming off the boil. Slowing industrial demand and a shift toward electricity rather than gas for replacing coal in centralized heating will push down demand, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last month. Prices in Europe and Asia will potentially fall below $3 per million British thermal units, they wrote, approaching North American levels.
Add in the impact of coronavirus and Wood Mackenzie estimates demand this year will come to between 316 billion cubic meters and 324 billion, as much as 19% below the Chinese National Energy Administration’s estimates of 350 billion cubic meters to 390 billion.
LNG will take a smaller share of that shrinking pie, thanks both to rising domestic gas production and imports from Russia’s 38 billion-cubic meter Power of Siberia pipeline, which opened in December.
These conditions should cause producers to slow down — but if anything, things are going in the opposite direction. A record 71 million tons a year of LNG export capacity was commissioned in 2019, adding about 97 billion cubic meters to the global market, according to Morgan Stanley.
That pace will surely decelerate, with projects such as Exxon Mobil Corp.’s P’nyang looking increasingly unlikely to be developed. Still, should we see more success from the faltering crackdowns on flaring — the wasteful practice of burning off associated gas from oilfields — there’s another 140 billion cubic meters of gas supply out there that’s currently being vented into the atmosphere.
Rock-bottom prices for gas, wind and solar swept through the energy sector in the western hemisphere over the past decade. To date, only renewables have really made an impact in Asia. With a flood of new gas supply approaching, that dam could be about to break."

Kraft Heinz on Thursday missed quarterly sales estimates, forecast lower full-year core earnings and wrote down the value of some businesses — including coffee brand Maxwell House — by $666 million.
The Chicago-based company whose products include Philadelphia cream cheese and Planters peanuts also highlighted “very, very volatile” pork prices due to problems in China including the deadly coronavirus, African swine fever and trade uncertainties. Four of the company’s eight factories in China are closed, Kraft Heinz said in an interview with Reuters.
Kraft Heinz’s sales have been muted for 14 straight quarters as consumers turn to cheaper private-label brands, online shopping and fashionable, non-processed and organic food. Thursday’s results mark the first anniversary of Kraft Heinz reporting a surprise loss and taking a $15.4 billion write-down of key brands — a move that rocked the consumer goods industry and led to the ouster of former chief executive Bernardo Hees and other executives.
At the time, the company also slashed its dividend by 36 percent and disclosed an investigation into its accounting practices by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In the year since, Kraft Heinz has announced further write-downs, scrapped its full-year adjusted earnings outlook and is still under SEC investigation.
The company, which also makes Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Kraft cheese slices, said fourth-quarter sales declined 5.1 percent due to lower U.S. demand for cheese, coffee, bacon and other products. The company said this was prompted by higher costs for key raw materials — including dairy and meat — that forced Kraft Heinz to raise U.S. prices by 3.1 percentage points."

But the most important name of all was missing: Paul Elliott Singer. 
Getting top billing in Masayoshi Son’s earnings presentation was Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which netted the Japanese company a 331.9 billion yen ($3 billion) paper gain for the fourth quarter, and telecom arm SoftBank Corp., contributor of 244 billion yen in operating profit. Sprint Corp. also added to the bottom line, though investors were more excited Wednesday about the long-awaited approval of its merger with T-Mobile US Inc.
Son couldn’t escape mentioning WeWork, formally know as The We Co., because it’s the elephant in the room weighing down the Vision Fund and by extension all of SoftBank. The $100 billion fund now has 88 portfolio companies.
But Elliott Management Corp., the investment firm founded by Singer, was conspicuous by its absence in Son’s vocabulary. As a result, his evasion became an unintended key feature of his entire live performance.
The famous activist investor was still there, writ large in a statement titled “SoftBank Group Adopts Enhanced Governance Standards for Investments.” Just last week, Elliott confirmed it had taken a nearly $3 billion stake in SoftBank because it saw room to close the gap between the value ascribed by equity investors and what its own balance sheet indicates. 
That news helped drive SoftBank’s share price up 8% for the largest gain in a year, a jump that was topped just a few days later when  the merger of the two U.S. telecom firms passed the final hurdle.
Elliott has three key strategies that it hopes SoftBank can implement to boost the stock: a $20 billion share buyback, more independent directors, and better corporate governance, especially with regard to its investments.
SoftBank’s press release on the governance, though, looks to be lip service rather than any kind of deep-seated reform. The four paragraph statement used the term standards eight times, but doesn’t actually detail what they are. We’re required to have faith that they exist and are robust. This new corporate governance policy wasn’t mentioned in the 83-page financial statement, and Son didn’t provide any details during two hours on stage. 
It wasn’t until two minutes from the end of Son’s set remarks that he even acknowledged Elliott, and then not by name but merely as “an activist investor.” He used the reference simply as proof that his pet peeve — that SoftBank’s share price severely lags its book value — was shared by others.
Only during the Q&A session did Elliott’s name first get mentioned  — by a reporter. 
Son’s response, and many that followed, were consistent in dodging not only Elliott’s core demands but in recognizing that the U.S. fund even had a valid point. He demurred on the topic of buybacks, noting that they’d been done in the past. He claimed to have had plans to appoint more independent directors even before Elliott brought it up. He indicated that improving standards was already on the radar.
Investors hoping for some contrition after the WeWork disaster — which saw SoftBank bail out the office rental company after an aborted IPO — would be sorely disappointed. Anyone believing that Son might suddenly discover the importance of enhanced management standards is naive. In his own words, corporate governance of startups is exercised by simply not investing in a problematic company.
About the closest Son got to acknowledging any weaknesses in his strategy of making huge bets on unprofitable companies in the hope they’ll come good was to admit that he’d dialed back the size of the planned $108 billion SoftBank Vision Fund 2  — a possibility I foreshadowed last month. Smaller and more circumspect bets may now be on the table.
Even before this second act, investors will need to contend with the more immediate fact that the Alibaba IPO was a one-time bonus, while the rest of SoftBank’s portfolio is at the mercy of stock markets at a time when the coronavirus epidemic is sending share prices on a roller-coaster ride.
So while people may have high hopes about the role Elliott could play in spurring SoftBank to change its ways, they ought to take note of the fact that Son barely utters the name."
"Feb 14, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/airbus-and-boeing-have-both-forgotten-how-to-make-money/2020/02/13/ff0b1dd2-4e4d-11ea-967b-e074d302c7d4_story.html,The Washington Post,Airbus and Boeing Have Both Forgotten How to Make Money,"Bombardier Inc. has given up trying to compete in the commercial aerospace market by selling its remaining stake in the 100-150 seat A220 program to its joint venture partner Airbus SE. The 1.4 billion-euro ($1.5 billion) full-year net loss that Airbus announced on Thursday, alongside that deal, is a painful reminder of why Bombardier’s own large jet ambitions always looked doomed.  
In theory, building commercial jets is a fantastic business. There aren’t many competitors — Airbus and Boeing Co essentially have a duopoly in large aircraft — and demand is booming. As people in emerging markets get richer they want to travel more and climate worries haven’t dissuaded most people from flying yet.
The trouble is that designing and launching a new commercial airliner consumes massive amounts of capital; and that’s if all goes to plan. Typically it doesn’t.
The delayed A220, then known as the C-Series, ended up costing Bombardier at least $6 billion to develop and caused its debts to balloon to an unsustainable level. Airbus came to the rescue in 2017 by taking a majority stake in the program. But even now, long after the plane entered service, it is a burden on Airbus’s cash flow. 
Another reason why Bombardier sought Airbus’s help back in 2017 was that Boeing persuaded the U.S. to impose punitive import tariffs, thereby hurting the Canadian manufacturer.
Trade and tariff threats are multiplying in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit. The better capitalized Airbus is more able to withstand these problems than Bombardier, but it’s not immune. Because of its World Trade Organization dispute with Boeing, the Americans have also imposed tariffs on the planes Airbus exports from Europe to the U.S.
Unlike Bombardier, Airbus and Boeing both have large defense business whose cash flows help fund their massive development costs. Even that’s no guarantee of success. Pension costs (a function of the large workforces needed to build big planes) are a challenge — Airbus’s pension deficit has swelled to about 8 billion euros because of low interest rates.   
And then there’s stuff that just seems to come out of the blue. Airbus disclosed an astonishing 5.6 billion euros of negative adjustments to its annual results.
Much of that relates to the fines Airbus must pay to settle bribery charges brought by various international authorities. But the company also suffered yet another 1.2 billion-euro charge on the troubled A400m military transporter program, more than 200 million euros of costs related to defense export restrictions, plus various other one-off costs.
For a while it seemed as though Boeing had cracked the financial alchemy of commercial aerospace. Soaring cash flows were returned to shareholders via a massive share buyback program. After two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max, we now know that success came at the cost of squeezing suppliers, browbeating regulators and neglecting safety. In 2019 Boeing reported its first yearly loss in two decades.
Following the disappointments of the A380 superjumbo program —  a seemingly bottomless money pit —  and various production difficulties involving new narrow-body aircraft, Airbus shareholders were hopeful that it too would start converting its massive order book into cash that could be returned to them. 
Airbus’s performance has certainly improved, yet that windfall never seems to arrive. Airbus’s 2020 production and profit guidance was weaker than expected. It should generate 4 billion euros of free cash flow this year, but once the corruption fines and several hundred million euros of tax and legal costs are paid, there will be precious little left. The coronavirus could yet cause unexpected setbacks; struggling airlines might have to cancel orders and there could be an impact on the supply chain. While Airbus is raising the dividend by 9%, share buybacks will have to wait.
Bombardier’s withdraw from commercial aerospace is a sad acknowledgement of how hard it is to make money selling big aircraft. Even Airbus and Boeing struggle."
"Feb 14, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/renault-cant-expect-a-tesla-style-helping-hand/2020/02/14/6a9ee0b4-4f2b-11ea-967b-e074d302c7d4_story.html,The Washington Post,French Giant Looks at Tesla With Burning Envy,"On one side of the Atlantic, Tesla Inc. is capitalizing on its soaring share price by selling $2 billion in stock so it can build more electric vehicles. On the other, French manufacturer Renault SA has been forced to cut its dividend by 70% and announce a big reduction in fixed costs so it can afford to do the same.
Dwindling profits and Renault’s drastic remedies were mirrored this week by its Japanese alliance partner Nissan Motor Co., as well at Daimler AG. (Renault has an engineering partnership with Daimler and owns a small stake in the German car and truck maker.) Their problems aren’t identical but all three had expanded their workforces in anticipation of demand that hasn’t materialized and now they have to tighten their belts to pay for expensive electric vehicles, for which demand remains uncertain.  
Renault’s shares are near their lowest level in eight years, which means the company is capitalized at barely 10 billion euros ($11 billion), a sum that includes the 43% stake Renault owns in Nissan. Needless to say, that’s a sliver of what Tesla is worth, even though the U.S. company’s annual output is still almost a rounding error for the Renault-Nissan alliance.  
This juxtaposition sends a crystal clear message: Carmakers that grew fat and happy producing combustion engine vehicles won’t get any help from the stock market now that they’ve decided to embrace an electric future. Instead the gasoline gang are going to fund these changes themselves and it’s going to be painful, for both employees and shareholders.
Long-established automakers have decided that their salvation is to be found in alliances and partnerships, which spread the cost of developing expensive technology over a greater number of car sales. It’s why Renault tried to merge with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, before Peugeot-owner PSA Group beat them to it.  
But in Renault’s case its links to other manufactures are amplifying its problems right now, not solving them. Relations with Nissan fell apart when former alliance boss Carlos Ghosn was arrested and remain fragile now that he’s free to settle scores. Both sides have since hired new CEOs but their shareholders aren’t yet ready to buy the story that harmony has been restored.
With its own profits slumping, Nissan can’t afford to pay big dividends to Renault and the French are also earning less from the Daimler partnership. The upshot is that Renault is a bit squeezed for cash — net cash at the automotive unit dwindled to just 1.7 billion euros at the end of December (though gross liquidity, including available credit lines, was a more respectable 16 billion euros). 
One way Renault could free up some money would be to sell part of its Nissan stake, which might have the added benefit of helping to re-balance the alliance in Nissan’s favor, something the Japanese have long sought. The trouble is Nissan’s shares have halved in value over the last two years so selling now wouldn’t provide Renault with nearly as much as it once would. Interim CEO Clotilde Delbos all but ruled out such a move on Friday.
So it’s no wonder that Renault has opted to drastically scale back its own dividend and will try to cut costs by 2 billion euros in the next three years. Delbos, who’s also the chief financial officer, didn’t go into much detail about how those savings will be delivered but the company plans to review its “industrial footprint,” which suggests plant closures are a possibility. (Alliance partner Nissan has already announced 12,500 job cuts, while Daimler is targeting at least 10,000.)
Lowering costs won’t be straight forward. New Renault CEO Luca de Meo, a former Volkswagen AG executive, doesn’t start until July and French unions aren’t known for championing efforts to slash jobs. In the near term, restructuring costs will also put further pressure on Renault’s cash flow and the coronavirus could yet create unexpected problems. 
But unlike at Tesla, Renault doesn’t have a queue of wealthy supporters clamoring to help fund this epochal clean-vehicle transition. One way or other, employees and existing shareholders will end up paying."

A lot bigger than we were initially told, it turns out.
On Thursday, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China’s Hubei Province — the epidemic’s epicenter — jumped by almost 15,000. It’s not that there was a sudden wave of new infections. Rather, the increase reflects a change in how China counts patients; it couldn’t diagnose the disease rapidly enough via lab tests, so it started identifying cases in other ways, such as CT scans.
That change not only upped the case total dramatically – it also threw into doubt assumptions about how much the disease has spread and how well it is being contained. It also revealed a critical vulnerability in the world’s ability to combat the virus and others like it. If we can’t accurately and rapidly diagnose the disease, how can we control it?
It will be months if not a year or more before an effective medicine is broadly available. Knowing who has the disease and whether to treat or isolate them has a far more immediate public health impact. Unfortunately, diagnostic efforts often reap less profit and get less funding than drug research. That’s contributed to an ecosystem that isn’t up to the current challenge.
In order to confirm infection, health workers now must send blood samples to central labs, which can test for the genetic signature of the virus — but are becoming increasingly overwhelmed. China has rapidly approved new tests, but there aren’t nearly enough kits available. America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is attempting to chip in, but some of the hundreds of test kits it has sent out are flawed. 
Even if there was enough testing capability, this approach has issues. Beyond labs getting overwhelmed, as they have in China, these tools aren’t capable of detecting the disease in its earliest stages. That lack of early detection means infections are inevitably missed, leaving us less able to contain it or know how far it has spread. Delays also raise the risk that healthy people get stuck in quarantine, where they are more likely to contract the virus.
Catching up to the demand for lab tests would only be a start. There needs o be a well-funded effort aimed at creating rapid tools to use on the front lines, from hospitals to airports and stranded cruise ships. Dozens of clinical trials of potential treatments are underway, testing everything from repurposed HIV drugs to traditional Chinese medicine. The Gates Foundation, government agencies, a Norway-based anti-outbreak superteam, and a half-dozen pharmaceutical companies are collaborating on multiple vaccines. There doesn’t appear to be anything comparable on the rapid diagnostic side. 
Governments also need to be able to test blood samples for antibodies at a population level to see how far the disease has spread. Right now, almost all cases outside of China are tied to known infections. But it’s entirely possible that the sometimes relatively mild disease is spreading in the U.S. and other countries without anyone knowing. Without better tests we may not know until outbreaks become too big to stop.
Catching diseases isn’t as sexy as preventing and curing them. But it deserves a lot more attention during the current outbreak and ahead of the next one. "

"Feb 15, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/14/mike-bloomberg-isnt-anti-trump-juggernaut-he-seems-be/,The Washington Post,Mike Bloomberg isn’t the anti-Trump juggernaut he seems to be,"An increasing number of Democrats are thrilling to the candidacy of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. He’s rising in the polls, driven by his seemingly nonstop television and Facebook ads. Here’s the Democratic candidate who’s finally willing to give President Trump as good as he gets on Twitter: When Trump called him a “mass of dead energy,” Bloomberg responded that the president was known as “a carnival barking clown” and that many of “the same people” they know in New York are laughing at the president behind his back. Take that!
The attitude seems to be if you can’t beat them, join them. If it takes an elderly billionaire New Yorker to beat another elderly billionaire New Yorker, so be it. At least Bloomberg actually earned his vast $60 billion fortune and appears to want to do some good with it. Bloomberg has spent untold millions on climate-change and gun-control efforts, as well as millions of dollars helping Democrats flip the House in 2018.
But not so fast. Bloomberg’s candidacy is more than a Faustian bargain, as Eric Levitz correctly noted in New York magazine, of making peace with a semi-benign form of plutocratic rule; it’s a bargain that involves giving up advantages the Democrats actually have against Trump for an uncertain gain.
How well Bloomberg will hold up under public scrutiny is unclear. He is notoriously uncharismatic. All too often, his responses under even vaguely tough questioning reek of contempt and condescension — two mistakes that Trump, an expert public performer, never makes. (The president is just belligerent.) Once, after a nasty snowstorm during his tenure as mayor, Bloomberg referred to city residents’ complaints of his administration’s inadequate clean-up as “griping.” (He subsequently apologized.) New York City too expensive? Get over it. It’s a “luxury product.” Little surprise he refused to meet with the New York Times editorial board and seems less than eager to participate in next week’s Democratic debate.
And there is a lot to criticize: Bloomberg said — in 2019! — that Chinese President Xi Jinping “is not a dictator” and that the Chinese government “listens to the public.” Tell that to the people who tried to get word out about the coronavirus. Or maybe to the Uighurs, more than 1 million of whom are being held in internment camps.
Bloomberg only recently apologized for the heinous stop-and-frisk police policy that overwhelmingly targeted young minorities. His previous defense? “The way you get guns out of kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them.” The financial crisis? It was partly the result of the end of redlining, which, in his view, forced banks to lend money to less creditworthy folks — ignoring the fact that financial institutions had marketed deceptive balloon mortgages and cash-out refinancing to minority neighborhoods.
Trump, who claims to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, is suddenly vulnerable on the issue, given that he recently admitted that he will likely look to cutting them back if elected to a second term. But that vulnerability doesn’t extend to Bloomberg, who in 2013, said, “No program to reduce the deficit makes any sense whatsoever unless you address the issue of entitlements, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.”
And if you want a candidate who can capture the energy of the #MeToo movement and challenge Trump on his allegations of sexual harassment, Bloomberg is not your guy. As Laura Basset reported for GQ, 64 women have sued Bloomberg or his eponymous company for sexual discrimination and harassment. He’s also pointedly refused to release any of them from the nondisclosure agreements many of them signed as a condition of settling lawsuits.
And then, of course, there is the issue of the money. Americans, well, we’ve got a complicated relationship with money. We worship the wealthy, but repeatedly complain (with good reason) they have too much political power. Trump rode to power on this dichotomy, claiming his wealth bought him access and made him independent. In office, we now know that was a scam. Democrats, especially the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing, have emphasized a need to address the power of money in politics. With Bloomberg as its nominee, the party all but cedes that argument. Sure, Bloomberg claims he’ll raise taxes on the rich, but he has a decades-long track record of complaining about doing just that.
None of this is to say I wouldn’t vote for Bloomberg if he’s the nominee. But people like me, who consider Trump a unique threat to American democracy, are not who Democrats need to reach. The idea that a battle royale between two cantankerous billionaires with a host of problematic beliefs will engage less-connected voters is likely more chancy than many want to admit. In a worst-case scenario, it’s another version of what I like to call “fantasy politics for Democratic moderates.” It’s not just that Democrats are selling their soul if Mike Bloomberg is the nominee. It’s that they could be selling it for naught."

“When I was 8 years old, I remember watching a cartoon that explained the immune system to children,” writes Nasif in an email. “I loved it, and I decided then to draw and create my own comics.”
The immune system is the body’s natural defense against viruses, bacteria and other nasty stuff, Nasif says. But viruses are especially good at developing disguises that help them hide from the immune system. Which is why we need vaccines to help our bodies see through the act.
Most vaccines contain a weakened or dead version of the virus they are meant to protect against, though some vaccines carry only the proteins found on the virus’s surface. In either case, once these substances are injected into the body, your immune system grabs them up and learns how to identify them, kind of like a cheat sheet that helps you prepare for a big test.
Then, when the body comes into contact with the real thing — a healthy virus — it knows how to protect against it and can set to work gobbling up the viruses before they can do too much damage.
You may be wondering why you still have to get shots for something such as polio, even though no one you know has gotten it. This is where a term called “herd immunity” comes into the discussion.
“Vaccines act as a firewall that prevents the spread of diseases to others,” Nasif says.
When enough people develop resistances to a disease by getting a vaccine, the chance that a virus can infect someone and then keep spreading drops to near zero. This is how polio went from a disease that was infecting 350,000 people a year in 1988 to one that caused just 33 cases reported worldwide in 2018. Of course, the protection only continues if people continue to give their bodies a cheat code to beat polio — vaccines.
Many people are concerned that a new virus coming from the Wuhan region in China could become a big problem for people around the world. Nasif says that scientists are working hard to create a vaccine for this coronavirus, which causes a disease called covid-19, but that it takes time to produce a vaccine that will be safe to use in people.
For now, she says the best thing you can do to protect yourself against this or any other viruses, bacteria and other things that cause diseases, is to wash your hands frequently and avoid being close to people who are coughing or sneezing.
Nasif also suggests eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of sleep at night — two ways you can give your immune system a helping hand."

Online.","BEIJING — Almost 200 million kids across China started their second semester on Monday. But it was a school day unlike anything they had before the Lunar New Year holiday.
For starters, they didn’t stand in front of a flagpole and sing the national anthem. They watched it on screens. In some parts of the country, so many kids were watching at the same time that Internet speeds ground to a halt.
Then came Chinese and English lessons, all online, and math and science classes, also online. One middle school boy, sitting with his computer at his front door in Beijing, was asked what he was studying. He responded: physical education.
Chinese authorities have taken extreme measures to try to contain the coronavirus, which has spread nationwide. More than half the country’s 1.4 billion people are now restricted from leaving their homes in some way. Public gatherings are banned, including those in schoolyards.
Most Chinese schools were due to resume classes Monday but have instead moved to some kind of online or home learning system, straining the resources of teachers, the attention of kids and the patience of parents.
“What kind of life am I living?” said Cao Jing, a mother of two in Zhengzhou, who is not just cooking and doing laundry for her two children, an 11-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy, but is also copying test papers by hand and trying to wrangle technology for online classes.
Her kids, already struggling with cabin fever, are not enjoying the switch to online learning.
“They only think about playing and don’t want to study at all,” said an exasperated Cao, who added that she hopes they will be back at school before she “falls apart.”
Some parents vented anonymously on social media. “When all schools’ online classes officially kick off today, parents will become teachers’ assistants and nannies,” one mother wrote on Weibo. The sentiment was apparently not appreciated. The post was soon deleted by censors.
For one family at center of coronavirus crisis, a death, stress and fight for a hospital bed
This scene is playing out in homes nationwide — with no end in sight. All schools are closed indefinitely while the public health emergency continues.
So China is channeling its full technological might into making sure kids can do their lessons remotely.
The Ministry of Education on Monday introduced a “national Internet cloud classroom” supported by more than 7,000 servers and designed to cater to 50 million elementary and middle school students at the same time. Lessons cover 12 academic subjects, including “moral education” and “epidemic education.”
Meanwhile, China Education Television is broadcasting online learning programs through satellite to remote areas with weak Internet connections.
China’s state media has tried to turn these lemons into lemonade. “Every disaster can serve as a shock and challenge to our life values,” China Comment wrote. “The ongoing war against the virus is a great class for students and real-life training for adults as well.”
Annie Yao, the mother of a Beijing fifth-grader, gave the online classes a positive review, saying they had not demanded much of her and had occupied her 11-year-old son, Jerry, who studied from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday.
“He’s happy to have classes today,” she said. “His teacher assigned a book to read and asked them to write a report, to draw pictures, do anything they’re good at.”
Still, Jerry said he prefers school and playing with his classmates during recess.
Fourteen American cruise ship passengers with coronavirus among those evacuated to U.S.
In the southern city of Shenzhen, teachers at Mingde Experimental School were trying to come to grips with the technology on the first day back.
“It is a compromise made between the school and parents, because some working parents can’t supervise children’s learning during workdays,” said a teacher who gave only his family name as Yang because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.
Indeed, the system has numerous shortcomings. Many families don’t have computers. Those with more than one child may not have more than one device. Child care in many families in China is provided by grandparents, who may not be Internet-savvy. There is also the problem of extended screen time.
At the upper levels, the disruption to the school schedule could prove calamitous. Each June, about 10 million seniors sit down for their day-long college entrance exam, a single test that can make or break their futures.
The Education Ministry is closely monitoring the epidemic and will decide later whether to delay the exam, an official said last week.
But it’s not just kids who are at home. Many people with office jobs are working remotely, meaning parents are trying to work from home, often in small apartments, with a child taking online classes and unable to go outside to blow off steam.
To try to ease the pressure, Beijing authorities have said that in families with two working parents, one of them would be able to stay home and look after the children without losing any pay.
Despite China’s appeal for a return to work, it’s business as unusual in Beijing
Meanwhile, kids have been robbed of something that is the foundation of family balancing acts everywhere: the comforting structure of the school day.
Children may be feeling stressed and may become more clingy, anxious, angry or agitated, the World Health Organization says in guidelines for dealing with the outbreak.
“Keep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible, or help create new ones in a new environment, including school/learning as well as time for safely playing and relaxing,” the advice says.
China’s Education Ministry said in a notice published last week that “online classes aren’t solely for academic purposes.” In addition to studying the curriculum, teachers could provide instruction on mental health.
Schools around the country report having built classes into the schedule to help kids deal with their emotions.
“We’ve launched all the rich and varied online courses we can think of,” said one teacher at Experimental Primary School in Beijing, giving her name only as Gao because she wasn’t authorized to speak to reporters. Those courses include classes to try to take care of students’ mental and physical health.
In Shenzhen, Yang tried to remain upbeat: “Nobody knows for sure when we can return to school eventually, but we are doing the best we can to engage our students and keep things going.”"
"Feb 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/bolton-says-his-account-of-trump-foreign-policy-risks-being-suppressed-by-the-white-house/2020/02/17/d0feb8a4-51d6-11ea-9e47-59804be1dcfb_story.html,The Washington Post,Bolton says his account of Trump foreign policy risks being ‘suppressed’ by the White House,"Former White House national security adviser John Bolton on Monday questioned whether it was “fair” that President Trump has called him a liar on the subject of Ukraine, but “I can’t talk about it.”
In his first public remarks since Trump was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate, Bolton said his own views of national security policies, and descriptions of interactions with Trump on Ukraine and other issues, risk being “suppressed” and censored by the administration.
His ability to speak was restrained, he said, because of the White House “prepublication review” of his forthcoming book “and threats of possible legal action.”
In a 90-minute question-and-answer session before students, faculty and members of the public at Duke University, Bolton voiced familiar hard-line views on North Korea, Iran and other issues. He said he viewed Ukraine and the impeachment “as sprinkles on the ice cream sundae” compared with other subjects he deals with in the book.
Asked whether he agreed with the president’s assessment that Trump’s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “perfect,” Bolton said “You’ll love Chapter 14.”
Bolton left the administration in September, after 17 months as Trump’s third national security adviser, following policy rifts with the president. Trump announced via Twitter that he had fired Bolton, although Bolton, also via Twitter, said he had resigned. Bolton’s book about his time at the White House, titled “The Room Where It Happened,” is scheduled to be published on March 17.
Portions of the book were leaked to the New York Times, including Bolton’s firsthand account of what he said were discussions with Trump about the president’s withholding of aid to Ukraine unless its government investigated his Democratic political rivals. Those allegations became the basis of Trump’s impeachment in December.
After the impeachment, Bolton offered to testify at the subsequent Senate trial, if subpoenaed, but the Republican majority voted not to call witnesses. This month, the Senate acquitted the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction. In recent weeks, the White House — to which Bolton submitted his book for national security vetting — has told him it has “serious concerns” about what it says is classified information in the book.
Bolton’s lawyer has disputed that assessment and asked for the White House to expedite completion of its review. It remains unclear whether publication will go ahead without White House approval.
“I hope it’s not suppressed,” Bolton said. “This is an effort to write history, and I did it the best I can. We’ll have to see what comes out of the censorship.”
“I say things in the manuscript about what he said to me,” he said. “I hope they become public someday. He tweets, but I can’t talk about it. How fair is that?”
Bolton hinted that the book contains revelations on a number of subjects, but he declined to answer a number of specific questions. Asked for his account of Trump’s controversial meeting with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin in the summer of 2018, he said, “I could read a chapter from my book and give you an answer.”
“In my view, to pursue the right policies for America, I was willing to put up with a lot,” he said.
Bolton has denied leaking any of the manuscript and suggested that the revelations came from within the administration. “Probably with leaks coming out of the administration, in due course you’ll know everything that’s in the book.”
He voiced his well-known views about North Korea, saying that the administration’s effort to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program was “going to fail.”
Despite Trump’s claims that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said he would do so, Bolton said there was “not a single piece of evidence that the government of North Korea intends to give up nuclear weapons.”
“This idea that they can be coaxed into giving up … their nuclear program was flawed from the start,” he said.
Pyongyang, he said, was “jiving the Americans” and is getting closer every day to the capability of dropping a nuclear weapon on American cities.
On Venezuela, Bolton said the administration’s “theatrics” were “not equivalent to support” for the removal of the government of President Nicolás Maduro.
Bolton said China, which he described as “the number one national security issue for the rest of the century,” may have known about the coronavirus epidemic “weeks and weeks before it was announced.”
About 1,000 people attended the free event. Outside, a protest drew about two dozen students and faculty members who objected to Bolton’s hard-line views.
After Bolton’s appearance was announced earlier this month, all available tickets were distributed within minutes.
Duke University has its own connection to prior impeachments. Richard M. Nixon, Class of 1937, and former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr, Class of 1973, earned their law degrees there.
Bolton is also scheduled to speak Wednesday, alongside former Obama administration national security adviser Susan E. Rice, at Vanderbilt University."
"Feb 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/alibabas-china-disconnect-cuts-hong-kong-dead/2020/02/11/ad0cadec-4cb4-11ea-967b-e074d302c7d4_story.html,The Washington Post,Alibaba’s China Disconnect Cuts Hong Kong Dead,"The decision to exclude shares of China’s biggest e-commerce company from a cross-border trading link is a blow to Hong Kong. Is it a punishment, or simple self-interest at work? The answer matters, both for the city’s exchange and for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
Alibaba can’t be included in the stock connect program linking Hong Kong with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges at present, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. China’s securities regulator has yet to agree to rule changes proposed by Hong Kong Stock Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. that would allow the internet company to participate, one of the people was cited as saying.
Granted, the Jack Ma-founded internet giant doesn’t qualify under the stock connect program’s existing arrangements, which exclude companies that have secondary listings with weighted voting rights. These were already in place before New York-listed Alibaba raised $13 billion selling shares in Hong Kong late last year.
But exceptions have already been made. In October, China allowed companies with dual-class shares to join the connect, giving investors in the mainland access to Hong Kong-listed technology companies Xiaomi Corp. and Meituan Dianping. Rules can be changed when there is the desire to do so.
Clearly, that was the expectation among investors here. The notice on dual-class shares was posted by the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges in mid-October and took effect Oct. 28. Three days later, Alibaba was reported to be planning its secondary listing in Hong Kong the following month. The shares started trading Nov. 26.
Investors in Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock will have a right to feel short-changed if the shares lose steam as a result. They dropped as much as 2.5% after the Bloomberg News story published, before recovering to close little changed. Alibaba has rallied more than 20% since its debut in Hong Kong, at least partly on anticipation that the stock will draw a wall of money from mainland Chinese investors who wouldn’t otherwise be able to buy.
The lack of support for Alibaba to join the stock connect is a severe blow to Hong Kong’s aspirations of marketing itself as the offshore listing venue of choice for Chinese technology companies, in an environment where the U.S. has become increasingly inhospitable and businesses are considering their options. Trip.com Group Ltd. and Netease Inc. are among U.S.-listed Chinese enterprises that are said to be looking at listing in Hong Kong. Bankers have talked of pitching other names including JD.com Inc. and Baidu Inc.
The prospect of acquiring an enthusiastic mainland investor base that would help to buoy valuations is a key selling point for those who might be tempted to decamp from a U.S. exchange. If Alibaba — a marquee name with a $578 billion market capitalization — can’t get the nod, what’s the hope for any of the others?
More worrying for Hong Kong is what the reluctance may say about China’s support for the city, as it contemplates the hit to its own economy from the coronavirus epidemic. HKEX, after all, is a competitor as well as a partner with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. If Hong Kong becomes too attractive a venue for China’s leading companies, that may hold back development of the mainland’s markets.
In 2018, Hong Kong relaxed its listing rules to admit unprofitable technology companies, competing with the U.S. and making the exchange even more alluring to Chinese hopefuls than the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets. In turn, Shanghai introduced the tech-focused Star Board in July, a Chinese answer to the Nasdaq that accepts money-losing companies with weighted voting rights. After a lively start, the board’s performance has been underwhelming. It has drawn few big names and has thin turnover.
All may not be lost. Smartphone maker Xiaomi had been public in Hong Kong for 15 months before it joined the connect, while food-delivery app Meituan had to wait 13 months. HKEX and Alibaba will have to hope this is the slow arm of bureaucracy rather than the cold shoulder."

The Trump presidency is a horrifying natural experiment for just this question. On the one hand, even though President Trump exaggerates the case, the economy is growing. Stocks are high, and unemployment is low. On the other hand, there has never been an American president who violates every foundational value of our society the way Trump does.
In a society founded on principles of religious liberty, he called to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In a society that claims to reject racism, Trump is a bigot who praises those who march alongside Klansmen and neo-Nazis. In a society that claims to reject sexism, he is a sexist who has boasted about committing sexual assault. And in a society that claims to reject bullying, lying and callousness toward the worst off, Trump is a walking master class in all three.
But it’s not just that Trump violates our collective values. He also attacks the very institutions of our democracy. He is politicizing the rule of law. He has committed clear abuses of power and sneers at efforts to hold him accountable. He undermines the freedom of the press with threats and intimidation. He is precisely what our Founding Fathers warned us about — the reason they put checks and balances in place.
As never before in American history, voters face some disturbingly straightforward questions as they head to the ballot box this November. What’s the price of your values? Would you sell our democracy? And what abuses are you willing to accept so long as your stock portfolio grows? So far, the answers aren’t reassuring.
Between now and November, Trump will continue to betray American values as he has for the past three years. He will spread unhinged conspiracy theories. He will lie dozens of times per day. He will continue his calls to investigate or jail political opponents because they are his rivals. He will engage in corruption and self-dealing, using public office for private enrichment.
If all Americans were actually willing to vote according to their values, Trump’s candidacy would already be dead. But here’s the unfortunate truth: We are a country full of millions of people who are willing to look the other way and abandon our values so long as the stock market goes up, our 401(k)s soar and the economy shows no sign of slowing down.
None of Trump’s awful behaviors is as likely to damage his reelection prospects as much as a one-percentage-point drop in GDP growth. A weaker-than-expected jobs report in October 2020 would almost certainly hurt Trump’s reelection prospects more than a few more kids dying in detention camps at the border. Enough voters have already chosen their wallets over our values. They are a key voting bloc that has given Trump a (narrow) path to reelection despite his appalling, disqualifying behavior. They are his amoral secret weapon.
Sure, Trump’s disqualifying behavior has had a political effect. Given the historic relationship between economic performance and approval ratings, Trump’s reelection chances should be higher based on economics alone. There are clearly plenty of voters who like the economy but loathe Trump. Millions will vote against him on the basis of values.
Nonetheless, we can no longer ignore an unsettling fact. Many American voters simultaneously believe Trump is a dangerous bigot unfit for office and that he should be reelected so long as the economy stays on track. Those voters will likely cast the deciding votes.
Yet the assumptions underlying such a stance are flawed. First, these voters are wrong on the economics. Growth in the first three years of the Trump administration have been basically the same as the last three years under Barack Obama, and job growth is lower for Trump than for Obama during that same period. To prolong the economic recovery started under Obama’s presidency, Trump’s spending and tax bill have saddled U.S. taxpayers with trillion-dollar deficits for the foreseeable future. It’s a sugar high that won’t last.
Second, and even worse, Trump’s amoral voters are heavily discounting the possibility of catastrophic risk that comes with an intellectually incurious, temperamentally unfit president. So far, we’ve been lucky. Iran’s missiles didn’t kill anyone, North Korea hasn’t launched a nuke, and the Wuhan coronavirus hasn’t become a full-blown pandemic (yet).
But when our luck runs out at some point — and it will — those voters who fixated on their 401(k)s may live to regret the consequences of their choice. By making a Faustian bargain in the short term, they’re sealing a far worse long-term fate for both their wallets and our values.
You don’t have to love Democrats to vote to protect democracy. And you don’t have to hate Trump’s economy to vote against his attack on our values. But if you rationalize a vote for Trump to fatten your wallet while sacrificing your values, you should keep in mind that you may be voting to sacrifice both."

Despite factoring in possible downside from the China coronavirus outbreak in its original forecast, the iPhone maker realized that things have deteriorated much more than it had anticipated. It gave no new figure and merely said the old one no longer applies, an admission that the company really can’t quantify the impact.
While we should expect similar downbeat tones through the rest of the sector, this really means we should keep tabs on the one company that sits at the heart of the global technology supply chain: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
Apple is TSMC’s largest customer. When the chipmaker gave its own first-quarter and full-year forecasts Jan. 16, the world had barely heard of the disease now riveting its attention.
Since then, Apple has shut stores in China and downstream assemblers like Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. have struggled to ramp up production after the Lunar New Year break amid continuing quarantines and a shortage of workers willing to return to the factory floor.
Nvidia Corp., which designs graphics chips, is another major client of TSMC. On Feb. 13, it said the virus had cut its forecast by $100 million. That’s only around 3% of expected revenue for the quarter, but it all eventually adds up. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., not a direct customer, forecast a decline in revenue from its core businesses as consumers on its e-commerce platform shy away from spending. At least some of those lost sales will be electronics products, which use chips made by TSMC.
Chinese companies, including Huawei Technologies Co., accounted for 20% of TSMC’s revenue last year. With numerous enterprises in China on lockdown, adding to the squeeze on both demand and production, it’s unlikely such clients will be able to escape the impact.
And last week, wireless industry association GSMA scrapped its annual Mobile World Congress scheduled for Feb. 24 in Barcelona because most of its major participants had already pulled out. This isn’t a consumer event, but the cancellation shows the breadth and reach of the outbreak’s impact on business. 
Whichever way you look at it, the global tech slowdown leads back to TSMC. 
Revising guidance mid-quarter isn’t without precedent, and TSMC usually does with a statement filed mid-afternoon Taipei time. It did so a year ago this week, cutting its sales and profit outlook after facing troubles with chemicals used in the manufacturing process. The result was a 10% reduction in operating profit. 
Just a few months before that, a production hiccup caused by a computer virus in its equipment hurt gross profit by around 5%. An earthquake four years ago sliced operating income by about 7%. The biggest mid-quarter guidance cut I could find is the 25% hit to operating profit that it took in December 2008 as the financial crisis brought the world economy to a halt.
To be sure, it’s not certain that a cut will be necessary this time. Clients may decide that they want to keep building up inventory of the chips that come out of TSMC’s factories. But at some point, end-demand may dictate a more cautious approach to procurement. 
This epidemic is proving hard to quantify, so TSMC’s biggest challenge may not be whether to revise guidance, but what new number to give. "
"Feb 19, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/hsbc-is-no-mans-land-for-quinn-or-anyone-else/2020/02/18/db8c3cea-522d-11ea-80ce-37a8d4266c09_story.html,The Washington Post,HSBC Is No Man’s Land for Quinn or Anyone Else,"HSBC Holdings Plc is embarking on a radical overhaul while it continues the hunt for a permanent chief executive. For investors, the strategic muddle of this bizarre situation should be at least as troubling as the stinging cuts, $7.3 billion of charges and suspension of buybacks that the bank announced with its earnings Tuesday.
The London-based lender will cut as many as 35,000 jobs, reduce gross assets by more than $100 billion by 2022, shave annual costs by $4.5 billion and slash the size of its investment bank in Europe and U.S. in the biggest raft of changes for years. All this will be overseen by Interim Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn pending the appointment of a permanent successor to John Flint, who was ousted last August.
Quinn was left to present the plan even as HSBC declined to confirm him in the job. This is bad on two levels. First, it undercuts the authority and investor confidence that Quinn might otherwise be expected to enjoy, should he eventually be appointed. At the very least, the delay signals that the board has harbored doubts about his suitability. Second, going ahead with the revamp may impede the search for a replacement.
Any chief executive worth his or her salt will expect to put a personal stamp on the company. But the biggest decisions have already been made. This reshaping will have Quinn’s fingerprints all over it. That may narrow the options for HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker. Stephen Bird, Citigroup Inc.’s former top executive in Asia and the leading external candidate for the job, already has ruled himself out, the U.K.’s Sunday Times reported last weekend, citing unidentified sources.
HSBC might argue that waiting wasn’t an option after years of sub-par performance. “Parts of our business are not delivering acceptable returns,” Quinn said in Tuesday’s statement. HSBC will shift resources to higher-returning markets, while squeezing the cost base and exiting some business lines. “The current strategy is in no man’s land,” as one investor told Bloomberg News pre-earnings.
No one could accuse HSBC of sparing the knife this time. The job cuts are equal to about 15% of the workforce. They’re also an answer to those who, like this writer, have criticized the bank for being overly timid in the past. Still, the overhaul may end up exacerbating some of the vulnerabilities they seek to address.
The restructuring makes the bank even more hostage to the fortunes of Hong Kong and mainland China, two economies struggling with slowing growth aggravated by the coronavirus outbreak. Hong Kong was already the source of 90% of HSBC’s profit in the third quarter. The city is going to become an even more glaring presence in its books.
Besides an economy in recession, competition is getting tougher for HSBC in the city, as online lenders backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. prepare to launch this year. Hong Kong’s dominant bank has also had to navigate political minefields, including being the target of the public ire last year after it closed an account linked to pro-democracy protesters.
China, meanwhile, remains a challenge. HSBC is still struggling  to extricate itself from Beijing’s bad books for providing U.S. prosecutors with information that led to the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co.’s  chief financial officer in late 2018. And disruption to supply chains from the virus outbreak may lead to more credit losses, the bank has said.
That means it’s going to take a long time before HSBC achieves the returns Tucker seeks. While 2019 adjusted pretax profit of $22.2 billion beat analysts’ estimates, HSBC’s fourth-quarter return on tangible equity was a mere 8.4%. That’s much lower than the more than 11% target it abandoned in October. Even its new goal of 10%-12% by 2022 looks unambitious beside the 18% return of JPMorgan Chase & Co. HSBC shares closed 2.8% lower in Hong Kong after the earnings, the biggest decline in more than a year.
Ultimately, HSBC’s biggest risk may be that Quinn’s cuts cause the lender to double down on greater China just as growth in this part of Asia is uncertain. Outside CEOs won’t be clamoring to steer this ship. Quinn may just be stuck with the job. "

Just Like Its Customers,"Apple Inc.’s earnings warning is an unfortunate reminder that, for all of its work to change investor perceptions over the past few years, it remains “the iPhone company.”
For much of its six-year reign as the world’s biggest company by market capitalization through to the end of 2018, Apple was actually less valuable than Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. on one crucial measure. The smartphone maker’s shares traded at a discount to those of the advertising technology giants based on its projected earnings — meaning investors were willing to pay more for a share of its rivals’ future profit. Even in its pomp three years ago, Apple’s stock traded at just 14 times forward earnings. Alphabet and Facebook traded at 20 times and 24 times earnings respectively.
This showed that investors were more confident in Google and Facebook maintaining, or increasing, their profits than they were in Apple doing the same. That was largely because Apple is fundamentally a hardware company: At the time it was getting almost two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone. It has lower gross profit margins since it has to pay for all the components used to make the handsets, as well as the labor and shipping costs. And, in order to meet its earnings targets, Apple has to convince consumers to spend another $800 on a smartphone every two years. If it ever came up with a dud iPhone, then earnings would suffer.
As software companies, Google and Facebook have much higher gross profit. And given their stranglehold on internet advertising, they can count on regularly recurring revenue from that business. Back in 2017, Facebook knew it could generate an average of $21 per quarter for each user from fees that brands would pay to get their ads in front of users’ eyeballs. It wasn’t dependent on any one consumer product to keep that income flowing.
Apple, unhappy about its relative discount, has spent much of the past four years working to lose it by moving beyond hardware. In 2019, iPhone sales represented 55% of its total revenue, down from a 2015 peak of 66%. In part, that’s because sales of the smartphone have declined, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has also invested aggressively in new services (think Apple Music, TV+, News+, Arcade and so on), as well as wearable devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods.
This has made Apple less dependent on the iPhone. And it’s made the company’s customers more dependent on the device. Since the Apple Watch must be paired with an iPhone, for instance, it reduces the chance of customers trading in their Apple handset for a phone that runs on Android. The handcuffs are tightened every time somebody installs a new game from Arcade or adds songs from Apple Music to their library – they’d lose them all by abandoning the company’s operating system.
Apple’s valuation has reacted commensurately. The stock is trading at 23 times forward earnings, more than Facebook’s 21 times and just shy of Alphabet’s 24 times. That’s partly down to the adtech giants’ own regulatory troubles — brought on by their troubling use of personal data and disquiet about their online ads duopoly. But Apple has succeeded too in convincing investors that it has dependable recurring revenue.
That faith will have been shaken a little on Tuesday morning, after the company said revenue in the first three months of the year won’t hit the low end of its expected $63 billion to $67 billion range. The stock was trading some 4% lower in out-of-hours trading. The new coronavirus has stifled demand from Chinese shoppers less able to leave the house, and made it harder to recruit the workers needed to make its new low-cost handset.
That stifled demand will no doubt recover once the virus abates. Nonetheless, this is a clear reminder that, for all its efforts, the iPhone is still Apple’s chief source of income. And that it will always be vulnerable to the capricious nature of consumer demand."

But should his successor ever wish to change it to something racier they’ll have to seek the blessing of Qatar Airways. On Wednesday the loss-making Gulf carrier said it had hiked its IAG stake from 21.4% to 25.1% in a move that will have cost about $600 million at current prices.
Under British share ownership rules, an investor with 25% or more of the stock can block special resolutions, such as changes to the articles of association or to a company’s name. Unlike some airlines, IAG is focused on making money for its shareholders but it’s still a little baffling why the Qatar Airways boss, Akbar Al Baker, would pay all that money for such limited influence (his airline didn’t respond to questions seeking further clarification). Usually, the company’s approach is not to seek board seats.
Qatar Airways is doubtless snaffling up stakes in rivals as a means of asserting soft power on behalf of its government, and enhancing its own global flight network — and it’s not alone in doing that. But the Gulf company is one of the most acquisitive carriers, and maybe that’s not a good thing given the mixed performance of airline stocks. In addition to its IAG shares, Qatar owns minority stakes in Latam, Cathay Pacific and China Southern Airlines. It also wants one in RwandAir. 
Financial considerations aside, Qatar certainly has more of a need to curry favor with international partners than a typical airline. In 2017, the state’s regional neighbors Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates imposed an air, sea and land blockade that remains in place. That threatens Doha’s status as an aviation hub.
But Qatar Airways’ efforts to gain influence overseas by acquiring stakes in rival carriers haven’t always been welcome. Al Baker had to give up on buying a stake in American Airlines Group Inc. after the latter’s chief executive officer, Doug Parker, made clear the Qataris wouldn’t be welcome. U.S. airlines often accuse the Gulf carriers of unfair competition owing to state subsidies, which they deny.
More recently, Lufthansa AG said Qatar Airways should rethink any idea of investing in the German flag carrier. “We did not have Lufthansa privatized in Germany to have it nationalized in Qatar,” a spokesman told Reuters in December, sounding unusually frosty.   
In fairness, IAG has been one of Qatar Airways’ better investments. The stock has gained about 17% in British pound terms since the airline first acquired a 10% stake in 2015. Subsequent IAG share purchases have done better. With respect, though, few financial advisers would counsel their clients to make concentrated bets on airline stocks.
Some of Qatar Airways’ other investments are instructive. Earlier this month Air Italy went into liquidation despite Qatar’s strong desire to keep it afloat. In the end its 49% shareholding counted for nothing. The 9.6% stake that Qatar purchased in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. in 2017 also appears to be underwater. The stake was acquired for HK$13.65 a share but the stock is now worth about HK$10.50 amid the protests in Hong Kong and the new coronavirus. 
Others have struggled too. Qatar’s Gulf rival Etihad Airways PJSC invested in Alitalia and Air Berlin Plc. Both went bust.
Of course, Al Baker can invest his company’s capital however he wishes — he doesn’t have shareholders to answer to. But he may want to listen to someone who does. Walsh, who will step down at IAG in March, had this to say about the merits of shareholdings and alliances late last year: “Taking a minority stake without having some form of control, or some influence over what the airline is going to do, has no value whatsoever.”"

"Feb 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/selling-cars-in-china-is-worse-than-making-them/2020/02/19/de3c2a70-536f-11ea-80ce-37a8d4266c09_story.html,The Washington Post,Selling Cars in China Is Worse Than Making Them,"If you thought Chinese automakers were in trouble, try the companies that sell their cars.  
Investors have piled into auto dealerships’ stocks, pushing some up as much as 90% over the last six months on hopes that one way or another, there will be demand. They’re still up as much as 13% since the beginning of February, when the coronavirus crisis really took hold amid the usual slow buying period of the Lunar New Year. All that without a footfall in showrooms in a country that’s gone into lockdown.
With the outbreak wreaking havoc across the auto supply chain, among others, there has been hope that Beijing will throw around stimulus to get China Inc. through another rough patch. A cratering car market could lead the government to support yet more purchasing incentives and other measures directed at consumers. Already, authorities in Foshan in Guangdong province are giving consumers a 2,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan ($286 to $715) subsidy per new car bought. Households could start talking about car ownership as a safer option to public transport or ride-sharing. After weeks of empty streets, signs that traffic is picking up in bigger cities has many believing sales could get a lift.
Beijing can stuff cash into consumers’ pockets but they can’t drag them into showrooms. Potential buyers won’t go into dealerships and wrap their hands around a leathery steering wheel and engage with fancy gadgets if they don’t know who was touching them before. Yet as they sit at home, they’re in theory a captive audience for sales pitches leading them to dealers’ WeChat showrooms. One advertisement invites shoppers to check out cars in the online exhibition hall and “enjoy the new experience.” Online sales could boost demand, the thinking goes.
Investors are perhaps reaching for cheery scenarios. Under the hood, the situation at dealerships is far worse. Earlier this month, their association pleaded with financial regulators to provide funding support due to “extreme liquidity pressure” as they expect sales to fall off a cliff. In a sign of desperation, one of the weaker but large dealerships for luxury brands like BMW AG and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc tapped its existing bonds Tuesday for just $13 million at 12% for two years.Dealers have good reason to be worried. Their businesses are inherently working-capital intensive. They’re not turning inventory and sales fast enough to generate cash, and accounts receivable are stretched. Elevated inventories continue to tick up. Manufacturers can’t pay dealers on time, and dealers haven’t been able to meet sales targets that determine the rebates they get. Loan-backed sales could start to bite their auto finance arms as a weakening economy crimps consumer incomes.
As for stimulus measures and online showrooms buoying sales, hopes are thinning. Ultimately, buyers need to walk into a showroom and sign documents, whether or not they can pay some fees through WeChat or other platforms. Even the likes of Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. have tried their luck at online car sales, and it hasn’t resulted in much. As Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts put it, buying a car involves several interactions between buyers and other parties, including the dealer, and “the offline interaction requirements make online car sales almost impossible in the medium term.”Dealership earnings are primarily driven by new car sales. All else being equal, an increase of 50 basis points in new car sales margins boosts net profit by more than 10%, according to an analysis by HSBC Holdings Plc. Even if dealers manage to sell the heaps of cars they’re sitting on, big discounts erode margins. 
Other profit streams aren’t looking so strong, either. Dealers have come to rely on various fees and after-sales servicing for a big portion of their earnings. More than 40% of profits, on average, come from fees they charge for things like financing, registration and pre-delivery inspection. With competition rising, those won’t hold up. If sales are low, demand for servicing will also stagnate.
China’s auto dealers are trading at an average 8.5 times their one-year forward earnings. For most of these companies, that’s well above their long-term average of 7.1 times. All this is much better than carmakers themselves are faring. Investors can keep waiting for demand to pick up. But misplaced optimism can take this rally only so far."
"Feb 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/23/robert-samuelson-trump-deficit/,The Washington Post,Trump is hooked on deficits,"We are going to have this argument repeatedly between now and Election Day: Who gave us this lengthy economic expansion, which is now in its 11th year and is the longest in U.S. history? Is it President Trump and his economists, who claim that their policies — tax cuts, deregulation, trade agreements — have restored dynamic growth? Or is it mostly a stroke of good luck, reflecting a gradual revival of confidence after the crushing Great Recession of 2007-2009?
Politically, the answer may not matter all that much. As long as the economy continues to advance, Trump will probably receive the lion’s share of credit. For better or worse, incumbents usually get rewarded or blamed for the state of the economy when they’re in office. Still, the administration, through the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), has mounted an aggressive campaign to show that good policies — not good luck — are the main reason the economy is faring so well.
The gist of the CEA’s case is to compare the economy’s actual performance with what was predicted before Trump’s election. If the actual performance substantially exceeds the predicted performance, then something must account for the difference. The “something,” the CEA says, is better policies. Since the 2016 election, the economy has added more than 7 million jobs, far more than the 1.9 million jobs forecast by the Congressional Budget Office. Similarly, says the CEA, growth of the economy’s output (gross domestic product) has exceeded earlier forecasts.
The result, it has argued, has been a huge drop in unemployment across virtually all major ethnic, educational and racial groups, as the table below shows. For example, among African Americans, the peak monthly unemployment rate fell from 16.8 percent in March 2010 to 6 percent in January of this year. Other groups also enjoyed large declines.
The administration argues that the poor and the near-poor were among the biggest beneficiaries. “The labor market experiences that people are gaining today will change the trajectories of their lives—and those of their children—for years to come,” wrote Trump in the “Economic Report of the President,” a shorter version of the CEA report.
All this seems impressive. So what’s all the fuss about? Just this: There’s an alternative explanation of what happened. In this telling, the sustained economic expansion doesn’t result mainly from Trump’s lower tax rates, deregulation and trade agreements. Indeed, it’s widely acknowledged that Trump’s trade wars with China depressed economic growth because they created greater uncertainty.
Trump’s theory is that by lowering tax rates the government can stimulate investment and raise living standards. The reason: Investments become more profitable. In 2017, Congress dutifully passed legislation that cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.
But it didn’t work out as planned. There was a spurt of investment after the rate cut, but it rapidly declined. For the first nine quarters after passage of the tax bill, growth of private nonresidential business investment grew at an average rate of 3.4 percent, with faster growth (6.8 percent) in the first four quarters and much slower in the next five quarters (0.8 percent), according to the CEA report.
The implication is that lower tax rates may be much less powerful in stimulating investment than has been assumed. The economy may be more influenced by outside events (Boeing’s 737 Max jet crisis or the coronavirus) that affect the confidence of corporate executives and their willingness — or unwillingness — to invest.
Trump’s policy has been straightforward: keep pressure on the Federal Reserve for low interest rates and expand budget deficits. The extra spending endorsed by the White House and Congress, along with the 2017 tax cut, has added $4.7 trillion to deficits over a decade, estimates the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The extra spending and tax cuts put more money in the pockets of businesses and consumers, including through higher dividends and stock repurchases. Some of this extra money was spent boosting the economy.
It’s important to acknowledge what we know, what we don’t know and what’s up for grabs. Based on a reasonable reading of the record, the economy’s growth reflects continued reliance on large deficits. How long this can last is one of the unknowns up for grabs."

Antibiotics revolutionized the care of infections. Vaccines turned deadly childhood diseases into distant memories. Americans lived longer, healthier lives than their parents.
Yet today, some of the greatest success stories in public health are unraveling.
Even as the world struggles to control the coronavirus, U.S. health officials are refighting battles they thought they had won, such as halting measles outbreaks, reducing deaths from heart disease and protecting young people from tobacco. These hard-fought victories are at risk as parents avoid vaccinating children, obesity rates climb and vaping spreads like wildfire among teens.
Things looked promising for American health in 2014, when life expectancy hit 78.9 years. Then, life expectancy declined for three straight years — the longest sustained drop since the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed about 675,000 Americans and 50 million people worldwide, said Steven Woolf, a professor of family medicine and population health at Virginia Commonwealth University.
Although life expectancy inched up slightly in 2018, it hasn’t yet regained the lost ground, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“These trends show we’re going backwards,” said Sadiya Khan, an assistant professor of cardiology and epidemiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
While the reasons for the backsliding are complex, many public health problems could have been avoided, experts say, through stronger action by federal regulators and more attention to prevention.
“We’ve had an overwhelming investment in doctors and medicine,” said Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. “We need to invest in prevention — safe housing, good schools, living wages, clean air and water.”
The country has essentially split into two states of health, often living side by side, but with vastly different life expectancies. Americans in the fittest neighborhoods are living longer and better — hoping to live to 100 and beyond — while residents of the sickest communities are dying from preventable causes decades earlier, which pulls down life expectancy overall.
Superbugs — resistant to even the strongest antibiotics — threaten to turn back the clock on the treatment of infectious diseases. Resistance occurs when bacteria and fungi evolve in ways that let them survive and flourish, despite treatment with the best available drugs. Each year, resistant organisms cause more than 2.8 million infections and kill more than 35,000 people in the United States.
With deadly new types of bacteria and fungi emerging, CDC Director Robert Redfield said the world has entered a “post-antibiotic era.” Half of all new gonorrhea infections, for example, are resistant to at least one type of antibiotic. The CDC warns that “little now stands between us and untreatable gonorrhea.”
That news comes as the CDC also reports a record number of combined cases of gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia, which were once so easily treated that they seemed like minor threats compared with HIV."

But while President Tsai Ing-wen's support for Hong Kong protesters powered her to reelection last month, the church is Taiwan's only institution to publicly provide material assistance to people who have fled the Asian financial hub's crackdown on demonstrators.
Since protests erupted in June, hundreds of Hong Kongers have sought refuge in Taiwan, a self-governed democracy over which China asserts sovereignty. Most have entered legally, but a minority have used smugglers to reach Taiwan by boat. And although Taiwan has temporarily barred entry to most Hong Kongers amid the coronavirus outbreak, many in Hong Kong view the island as a place to resettle should their political strife worsen.
""We don't ask them their names, we don't ask how they came here,"" said Charles Kong, secretary for Che-lam head pastor Huang Chun-sheng. ""We just provide support once they get here.""
The church is doing what officials say Tsai's government cannot be seen doing, at least not too openly: helping Hong Kong refugees navigate a path to remain in Taiwan.
Kong says the church has never had contact with couriers shuttling Hong Kong protesters to Taiwan, some without passports or other documentation. But Che-lam has sent an estimated $530,000 in donated face masks and goggles to protesters in Hong Kong and has helped newly arrived Hong Kongers extend their stay in Taiwan, often providing medical care, housing subsidies and access to pro bono legal assistance.
He estimates that 200 Hong Kong activists have passed through the church, with at least 30 electing to stay in Taiwan. But others never reach its doors because of the proliferation of scammers and illicit agents who seek to exploit undocumented arrivals for financial gain.
Taiwan, which is not a member of the United Nations, has not signed the U.N. Refugee Convention and has no formal asylum laws. Its government processes people from Hong Kong on a case-by-case basis but provides no public assurance of their long-term legal status, leading to concerns that the uncertainty creates gaps for protesters to be exploited.
Rights groups and Hong Kong activists have reported cases of scammers promising formal documentation for large sums of money, and some worry that ­China-backed actors are seeking to contact and influence Hong Kongers in Taiwan under the guise of offering humanitarian assistance.
The lack of formal channels for incoming Hong Kongers leaves them uncertain about where to turn for help, said Wayne Chan Ka-kui, convener of the Hong Kong Independence Union. ""They don't trust NGOs. They don't trust political parties,"" he said.
In November, Chan was in contact with three Hong Kong protesters who entered Taiwan and were lured by an individual who promised them help, but who ultimately solicited donations while preventing the dissidents from contacting NGOs, he said, citing people close to the trio. He could not provide their names for security reasons.
""It's like kidnapping,"" Chan said.
Hong Kong was guaranteed a high degree of autonomy under its 1997 handover from Britain to China, but the Communist Party's tightening grip has many fearing for their future. A now-withdrawn proposal that would have allowed criminal suspects to be tried in mainland China's politicized courts sparked Hong Kong's worst unrest in decades.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, the government agency responsible for relations with China, Hong Kong and Macao, said in an email that it was aware of a self-proclaimed Hong Kong activist residing in Taiwan who ""lured other Hong Kongers to Taiwan"" and was forced to leave the island after overstaying his visa.
""Persons who lure other Hong Kongers to Taiwan in the name of support for the Hong Kong anti-extradition movement, and who instigate and threaten others into illegal actions will be faced with Taiwan's relevant criminal charges,"" the agency said.
There are other cases. In September, local media reported about an online advertisement promising Hong Kongers legal status in Taiwan for about $640. Chiu E-ling, then the secretary general of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, notified authorities, who released a statement urging Hong Kongers to be wary of fraudsters.
Chiu said such instances showed the need for laws allowing Hong Kongers to seek asylum in Taiwan. ""We don't want to have more victims of human trafficking,"" she said.
Since Hong Kong's protests escalated, only one Hong Kong national has publicly stated his intention to stay in Taiwan. Lam Wing-kee, a bookseller who arrived last year amid fears he could be extradited from Hong Kong to face criminal charges in China, plans to open a bookstore in Taipei.
Some Hong Kongers view Lam as a test case should they, too, seek to stay in Taiwan permanently. But he is on a tourist visa and insists that Hong Kongers should understand the limitations of Taiwan's government.
""Most of them are very impatient and anxious. I've been trying to talk to them and calm them down,"" Lam said in an interview. ""I'm using myself as an example and sharing my experience.""
Last July, he identified one case of a student protester who, upon arriving in Taiwan, was approached by a man purporting to be a national security agent. Lam, and the student's companions, feared the man was trying to ""buy off the protesters.""
Ho Ming-sho, a sociology professor at National Taiwan University, said Hong Kong protesters wary of spies and police infiltrating their ranks carry those fears to Taiwan, potentially leaving them ""prone to rumors and scams.""
Domestic rights groups have called for Taiwan to utilize Article 18 of its Act Governing Relations With Hong Kong and Macao, which allows the government to assist those ""whose safety and liberty are immediately threatened for political reasons.""
Taiwan has not publicly used the article, instead deferring to existing immigration laws. ""They're trying to be cautious,"" Ho said.
But Taiwan has quietly created avenues for Hong Kongers to stay, ranging from a pilot program for students to less-publicized measures such as unofficially loosening restrictions on tourist visa extensions.
""We have elastic ways to deal with that,"" said Wang Ting-yu, a legislator in Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party. ""This kind of rescue system, this help system, we have that. It's happening now.""
Joseph Wu, Taiwan's foreign minister, said in December that Taiwan would consider adjusting its assistance if China's military invaded Hong Kong. For now, Wang said, a formal process to accept Hong Kong refugees would ""offer Beijing an excuse to accuse Taiwan of being behind this movement.""
While the government says it cannot publicly open its doors to Hong Kong protesters, Wang said it is ensuring that those doors are not closed completely. ""We have an obligation to help them,"" he said. ""But we have our own way to help them."""
"Feb 25, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-clock-runsout-on-malaysias-new-beginning/2020/02/25/fa95ebf6-578f-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html,The Washington Post,The Clock Runs Out on Malaysia’s New Beginning,"After being ruled by effectively the same coalition for 61 years, Malaysia just witnessed the alternative collapse in less than two. The crisis sparked by the shock resignation of the 94-year-old prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, and how it’s resolved will grab all the attention for now. But the arrival of short-cycle politics will cast a long shadow over the Southeast Asian nation and investors will reset their antennae.
Mahathir ruled from 1981 until retirement in 2003, only to return 15 years later to cause the biggest electoral upset in Malaysia’s history. But while his latest government did make an early attempt to remove politicians from state-linked companies and disallow “support letters” that help favored businessmen win contracts, institutions in Malaysia remain far too unreformed and weak to withstand prolonged political flux.   What happens next is unclear, though an investment recovery this year can be easily ruled out. Mahathir might yet cobble together the 112 lawmakers needed to form the next government.  Or, he may back someone other than Anwar Ibrahim, to whom he was supposed to hand over the top job after about two years. But the prime minister obviously didn’t like his new partner and old enemy enough to commit to a transition date. (Mahathir fired Anwar, who was his chosen successor, in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Anwar was imprisoned on convictions of corruption and sodomy that he said were a plot to remove him from politics).  
The 72-year-old Anwar could take a shot at power, though he looks resigned to not becoming the eighth prime minister of independent Malaysia. “Maybe the ninth,” he said at a prayer ceremony at his home as the fall of Mahathir’s government looked imminent. His party, which was allied with Mahathir in an unwieldy coalition, has split. Economic Affairs Minister Azmin Ali, who was also jockeying for the top job, left with a small breakaway faction of 10 other lawmakers.The long-ruling Barisan Nasional regime, which was Mahathir’s political home before he fell out with his successors, is now back in the frame. Backing Mahathir — or his appointee — against Anwar may be the best chance for its elites to revive the old order. The coalition lost its stranglehold on power in 2018 because of popular disgust against then-premier Najib Razak over a scandal in which $4.5 billion was allegedly stolen from the 1Malaysia Development Bhd, or 1MDB, state investment company and laundered around the world. Najib is on trial for a range of related crimes; the former prime minister rejects the allegations against him.Whatever the outcome, it looks likely that the new dispensation will seek legitimacy by aligning itself with the Malay-Muslim majority. The ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities, which had long hoped that Anwar would get a chance to fulfill his promise of making economic entitlements needs-based, rather than centered on race, will be disappointed. Decades of pro-Malay policies forged in great part under Mahathir have encouraged rent-seeking while prompting young, educated and disillusioned minorities to seek their fortunes elsewhere.When it comes to spawning new-age digital companies, the country is lagging behind its neighbors. Smaller Singapore and poorer Indonesia are both doing better, despite Malaysia making an early start to industrialize its traditional oil and plantation economy. Any emerging coalitions will be too vested in the status quo of public construction contracts to seek a course correction.  
Unstable administrations also tend to be myopic about spending and taxation. One of the first things Mahathir did upon his May 2018 return was to scrap the goods and services tax, which had lowered Malaysia’s budgetary reliance on its aging oil fields. The GST was deeply unpopular because it was perceived to have raised the cost of living. But Malaysia’s high investment-grade rating probably won’t survive the global electric-vehicle revolution without more diversified sources of government revenue. It’s unclear how committed a new finance minister will be to medium-term fiscal goals. 
What should investors make of this muddle? Most of the reassessment may occur in the price of the currency as foreigners get cold feet. Malaysian government debt, on the other hand, might remain in demand from local retirement funds.
A slowing economy, which is already starting to weigh on the under-performing equity market, could support bonds. The coronavirus outbreak in China, which absorbs more than a fifth of Malaysian exports, is threatening to crush gross domestic product growth this year to 3.5%, according to ING Groep NV, its slowest since the global financial crisis.But just as neighboring Singapore rolls out billions of dollars in fiscal relief to mitigate the impact of the epidemic, decision-making in Kuala Lumpur is suddenly imploding, with Mahathtair continuing only as interim prime minister. The economy this year could well become an early victim of Malaysia’s shortening political cycle."

Granted, China’s political brass have been on steroids in recent weeks, meeting often and issuing frequent statements. In the last month alone, Xi and the Politburo Standing Committee — which consists of the country’s top leadership — have met four times, each concluding with a speech by the president. This level of engagement is extremely rare. 
The question is: What kind of message is getting delivered to local officials from Xi’s high-level and vaguely worded speeches?
From the latest communication, bureaucrats and investors alike may well believe that stable economic growth is front-and-center again. Xi devoted six paragraphs of his Feb. 23 speech, or 914 words, to the economy, compared with three paragraphs and 701 words to the virus. Unlike earlier meetings, politicians didn’t wear masks, a show of confidence that the worst of the outbreak is behind us.
By Monday morning, six provinces lowered their virus alert levels, a move that signaled freer labor migration. This came as China’s economy remained at a standstill amid municipal officials’ draconian quarantine measures. As of Friday, only large businesses in the relatively virus-lite eastern provinces saw half of their workers return, while smaller enterprises and inland China lagged behind, the government said in a briefing.
Against that backdrop, it’s possible that Wuhan’s misstep came down to crossed wires. Somewhere along the chain of command, the instructions were misinterpreted.
This certainly wouldn’t be the first time. In late 2018, a few third-tier cities felt emboldened to ease their housing-price controls, after a pro-growth agenda emerged at a key national economic meeting. Within a day, officials were forced to reverse their stance because they didn’t understand the “complexity” of Beijing’s top directives. 
And who can blame them? Xi’s words often run at odds with those of Beijing’s own technocrats. Last weekend, when he called for “even more” flexible monetary policies, the People’s Bank of China took a more measured tone. In an op-ed for the Financial Times, Deputy Governor Chen Yulu said the central bank saw a V-shaped rebound as the most likely scenario. He made no mention of reserve ratio cuts, which are being widely priced in by investors.
If history is any guide, Xi’s word is the last word. Central bankers and finance ministers are just the messengers who sometimes don’t get the instructions quite right. In March of 2015, for instance, the PBOC denied it would lower the down payment levels for second homebuyers in morning media reports, only to confirm it by the afternoon.
To be sure, hazy wording can give local governments room to interpret national policies to their own advantage. In Xi’s China, municipals are perpetually short of cash. Even Wuhan, a vibrant college town and tech hub, needed commercial activities and good jobs to fill its pension fund shortfall. So it makes sense officials would want to get businesses up and running again. 
So far, traders have largely placed their faith with Xi. Last week, the blue-chip CSI 300 Index recouped all of its losses since the prolonged Lunar New Year break, while the new economy-focused ChiNext Index notched a three-year high. As I’ve noted, this rally was largely thanks to Xi’s Feb. 3 speech, in which he insisted on delivering this year’s economic growth targets. This was widely seen as a prelude to a big stimulus.
But these lower-level flip-flops are concerning. Investors may be able to stomach the death toll, now at more than 2,600, or that China is sacrificing a whole province to contain the spread. But at a time of international emergency, we can’t have policy U-turns. That’s the downside of having an enigmatic political leader who has anointed himself president for life. "
"Feb 26, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/25/how-bolsonaros-risky-bet-china-amazon-could-backfire/,The Washington Post,How Bolsonaro’s risky bet on China in the Amazon could backfire,"Heriberto Araújo is a reporter who is currently working on a book about the human and environmental costs of the Amazon’s destruction. Melissa Chan is a reporter focused on transnational issues, often involving China’s influence beyond its borders. They were both previously based in Beijing. Their recent trip to Brazil was supported by the Pulitzer Center.
The cowboys and prospectors of the Amazon couldn’t be any happier. One year into his tenure, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is delivering on his campaign promise to reinforce, at whatever the cost, Brazil’s status as an agricultural colossus. In 2019, Brazil recorded its second highest ever soy production numbers and exported more than 50 percent more soybeans than the United States. Beef sales jumped 15 percent to reach an all-time high, including over $7 billion sold overseas.
China, the country’s largest trade partner, has driven this meat and grain boom, buying $31 billion worth of its food commodities last year. The partnership seems to work well: Brazil has the land, and China the demand. But Bolsonaro might want to think twice about this relationship.
Before his election, Bolsonaro had run on an anti-China platform. “The Chinese are not buying in Brazil,” he warned during the campaign. “They are buying [up] Brazil.
Since then, his posture has radically changed. Last October, he visited Beijing and declared that Brazil and China “were born to walk together.” His powerful minister of agriculture, Tereza Cristina, has even established a special China department to cater to Brazil’s largest customer.
This hasn’t turned off his supporters — for now. On China, “when he is wrong, he recognizes it and changes course. He isn’t ashamed of this,” Agamenon da Silva Menezes told us when we stopped by his office. The cattleman and representative of one of the most vocal ranching associations in the Amazon had supported Bolsonaro in the election.
For Bolsonaro, economic prosperity trumps environmental preservation. Agriculture and deforestation are the main drivers of emissions in the country, and logging the Amazon’s trees for timber, then converting that cleared land to expand the boundaries of soy fields and cattle pastures in order to sell more to China has become, in Bolsonaro’s mind, part of the country’s manifest destiny.
He has mostly ignored the global outcry to save the Amazon, which is critical to fighting climate change due to its ability to store massive amounts of carbon emissions. He has also cut the budget of the government’s environmental protection agency, hamstringing its ability to police the jungle, and sent the army in to finish paving the more than 800 miles of a highway bisecting the region, meant to facilitate the transport of grain to China through the Amazon basin. Deforestation rates in the Amazon reached a 10-year high in 2019 and jumped a staggering 183 percent between December 2018 and December 2019.
Meanwhile, China — a signatory to the Paris agreement on climate change — has kept quiet over its contribution to the crisis. When it comes to Brazil, Beijing has put its food security priorities ahead of its environmental commitments and chosen to do business with no questions asked.
Yet Bolsonaro’s bet on China may backfire. Meat prices in Brazil have skyrocketed domestically, fueling inflation. That’s a worrisome trend in a country where churrasco (barbecue) is almost a religion and where inflation sparked massive demonstrations in 2013 that threatened to derail then-President Dilma Rousseff’s bid for a second term. Experts and officials agree that the rising cost of beef at home is a direct consequence of record beef sales to China, where a devastating swine flu that has halved its pig population has led many Chinese to buy more beef as a replacement protein.
This hasn’t just come at the expense of Brazilian consumers. In some cases, it has even come at the cost of Brazilian sellers. Powerful Chinese state-owned enterprises recently bullied Brazilian exporters, renegotiating contracts at the last minute and pushing them to sell meat at a loss.
Now, Bolsonaro’s ambitious trade plans with China might face further jeopardy. Brazil had benefited from the trade war between the United States and China, stepping in to sell more soy and beef to the Asian superpower as U.S. farmers got cut out. But the boom times may be over, with the new trade deal essentially a purchase agreement with a pledge from Beijing to buy $36 billion worth of agricultural products from the United States this year, much of it soy, and $43 billion the next.
In order to honor its commitment, China has no choice but to pivot back to the United States. As a result, Bolsonaro’s staunchest supporters — farmers — may face a soy surplus this season, just when the harvest is forecast to reach an all-time high. In January, Brazil’s soy exports dropped more than 26 percent from the same period last year.
The coronavirus also looks set to severely hit China’s domestic growth and, in turn, demand for Brazilian food commodities. With many workers still under quarantine and on unpaid leave across the country, appetite for expensive, imported beef will — and already has — start to wane.
Bolsonaro now faces a dilemma. He can take a step back from the vagaries of Chinese demand and do what his admirers claim he’s good at: learning from his mistakes and changing course. He can work on preserving the Amazon; environmentalists say it is possible to develop the region sustainably. Or, he can double down on his partnership with China — and put Brazil’s, and the world’s, future prosperity at risk."
"Feb 26, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/does-mike-bloomberg-really-have-a-problem-with-women/2020/02/25/99dab79e-580a-11ea-ab68-101ecfec2532_story.html,The Washington Post,#MeToo misfires with Bloomberg,"When Ginny Clark became the first woman trainee at Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment firm where Mike Bloomberg got his start, she entered a man’s world that would horrify most young women of the #MeToo generation.
To say times were different in 1968 is an understatement. The era that birthed Bloomberg and gave rise to his self-described “Borscht Belt” jokes (as he has framed his sense of humor), allowed for insensitive punchlines, sexual innuendo — and much worse — that wouldn’t be tolerated today.
Clark, with whom I spoke by phone, gives credit to the #MeToo movement for exposing and bringing to justice people such as Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was found guilty Monday on two counts of criminal sexual assault, including third-degree rape.
She worries, however, about unintended consequences that could be harmful to women. She noted that her male friends on Wall Street today are afraid to be alone with a woman, lest something they say or do lands them in trouble. She says some now hesitate to mentor women or even to have dinner without a third party present. The downside may be that women will have a harder time finding jobs.
As we traded decades-old stories from first jobs when men did all the hiring, I wondered whether women were tougher back in the day. Clark at first said yes, and then she clarified that to mean that she and her friends were by training and culture less sensitive to things that would be considered unacceptable today. Perhaps this was a function of having little choice, but Clark didn’t think of her experience that way. For whatever reasons, she came to the job steeled for battle and then worked as hard as the boys.
This doesn’t mean that Clark endorses coarse behavior or subscribes to the boys-will-be-boys school of rationalization, but she says she doesn’t take off-color things personally. “The word bitch in a joke might offend someone today,” she said, “but it doesn’t offend me because it’s not directed at me.”
Even when something crass was directly aimed at her, she took it with the attitude of a casino card dealer working the night shift, which she did after graduating from Oklahoma University. On her first day at a subsequent job with a different firm — again as the only woman — Clark was streaked by the men, including the boss. Today, streaking might lead to a federal case. But when management investigated the prank, Clark says she shrugged it off as the price of breaking the glass ceiling in a males-only hierarchy.
“I knew what they were doing,” she told me. “It was a test to see if I could handle the testosterone club.” The answer, apparently, was yes. She became a trader, starting at Salomon, and she later became the first female trader at Merrill Lynch. At 76, she’s still going strong as managing director at boutique firm Beech Hill Securities.
I reached out to Clark after I heard about her from a mutual friend in the Bloomberg campaign. Clark supports Bloomberg, her former colleague, for president. She says she does not recognize the man described in recent media reports as someone who tolerated a sexist workplace and who settled cases with plaintiffs in exchange for nondisclosure agreements. The man she sat next to in 1968 — and later reported to — was 100 percent supportive, she says. “Sure, he (Bloomberg) told raunchy jokes. I told raunchy jokes,” she said. “He saw me as a team member and wanted me to do well. . . . I honestly don’t think I would have made it if not for Mike.”
Bloomberg, it should be noted, isn’t accused of criminal behavior in the vein of a Weinstein or other powerful men who physically assaulted and harassed women. But it is also obvious that the Bloomberg campaign feels it has lost some ground since the more unpleasant details of his workplace behavior have surfaced.
Context is everything, we say, because it’s so true. Bloomberg may have been formed by circumstances that have changed, but he too must change if he’s to stay a viable candidate. To his credit, under pressure by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), he ordered an end to using nondisclosure agreements in his company to “resolve claims of sexual harassment or misconduct.” And he released three former female employees who signed them under his watch. His greater challenge may be to convincingly convey that he’s sincerely sorry for making some women feel uncomfortable by jokes that weren’t, in fact, funny.
Whether voters are willing to overlook Bloomberg’s past will be determined next week on Super Tuesday, the first time his name will appear on primary ballots. I’d rather wonder whether a brilliant businessman with rational ideas has lust in his heart than listen to the car horn of Bernie Sanders’s voice promising socialist remedies to economic prosperity.
Assuming, that is, the coronavirus doesn’t ruin us all."

The P&R project worked in these three countries and 12 additional countries in Central and East Africa and Southeast Asia from 2014 to 2019 building local capacity to prevent and contain emerging pandemic threats.
Unfortunately, the funding for the umbrella Emerging Pandemic Threats program at USAID was cut severely in the 2019 budget, eliminating funds for Phase 2 of the P&R project, as well as funds for its sister project, PREDICT, which focused on identifying and preventing the spillover of animal-borne viruses to humans. As we confront the prospect of covid-19 spreading to these highly vulnerable countries, these local staff and advisers are no longer in place.
It is critical to understand that funding for pandemic preparedness and response has been episodic, depending ironically on outbreaks such as avian influenza, H1N1 and Ebola to reinvigorate support and dollars for essential programs. Going forward, we need a mechanism for sustained funding of pandemic preparedness capacity in resource-poor countries around the world, because an outbreak anywhere can be an outbreak everywhere."

Investors seem to think so. The reality may be different.
New York-listed NIO Inc., a self-described pioneer in China’s premium electric vehicle market and rival to Elon Musk’s company, said Tuesday that it has made a tentative agreement with the municipal government of Hefei in Anhui province for funding support. The company will move its China headquarters there from Shanghai and says it plans to raise more than 10 billion yuan ($1.43 billion) in light of the partnership. Other details were sparse. The stock surged as much as 34%.
Those are lofty ambitions considering the company was sitting on $1.5 billion of debt and is expected to post negative free cash flow of $1.4 billion for 2019, according to Bloomberg estimates. Earlier this month, NIO said it had raised $100 million in one-year convertible notes, bringing the aggregate to $200 million of private placements this year. It said it was “working on several financing projects, the outcome of which is uncertain at this stage.” Meanwhile, as the coronavirus hobbles China Inc., NIO can’t afford to pay its workers on time.
The company has done a few similar partnerships. Last year, it entered into a 10 billion yuan agreement to finance research and development and a new manufacturing facility with a state-owned fund in Beijing, E-Town Capital, in exchange for a minority stake. 
NIO counts the likes of Baillie Gifford  & Co. (a big Tesla investor), Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Temasek Holdings Pte among its backers. It has continuously burned cash since before going public in 2018. In the third quarter, it went through around 1.5 billion yuan to 2 billion yuan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts estimate. They also forecast another cash outflow of 14 billion yuan before the company can break even in 2023. As NIO noted in its latest results announcement for the third quarter, its “cash balance is not adequate to provide the required working capital and liquidity for continuous operation in the next 12 months.”
A helping hand from Beijing can’t turn around its operations at this rate of burn. Part of the fundamental problem is that the company doesn’t make its own cars. They’re manufactured by state-backed Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp., or JAC, at a plant in Hefei – where it’s moving – under a five-year agreement signed in 2016. The cost-effectiveness is questionable: For the first three years, NIO paid on a per-car basis and foot the bill for the plant’s operating losses. It isn’t clear what the arrangement is now.
Under the new agreement, NIO plans to build a manufacturing facility. It previously scrapped plans for one in Shanghai, where Tesla has been welcomed by the local government. 
Even though car sales have inched up, NIO has continued to spend well beyond its means. The cost of selling vehicles and other products rose faster than revenues in the third quarter. But its cost of sales rose to 2.1 billion yuan, up 2.3% from the second quarter, and climbed 30% from a year earlier. Research and development expenses came down from the second quarter but were almost flat on-year at 1.02 billion yuan, accounting for almost 60% of revenues.In its latest earnings call, the company said it was taking cost-reduction measures. It cut around 2,000 jobs between January and September last year. What money NIO does bring in may be better spent on making the cars, rather than feeding hype around them. 
More than cash, NIO seems to need a new strategy if it wants to survive."

Officials in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines said in recent days that they will begin setting up quarantine zones or scanning passengers from China for signs of fever or other pneumonialike symptoms that may indicate a new disease possibly linked to a wild animal market in Wuhan.
The health commission in Wuhan, a transit and business hub, says there is no clear evidence that the unidentified disease can be transmitted between humans, and no health-care workers have been infected. Cases of fever have been reported in Hong Kong and Taiwan by travelers who recently visited Wuhan, although there is no confirmation that the illnesses are linked.
Since mid-December, 59 people have been diagnosed with viral pneumonia of “unknown cause” — including seven who are critically ill, according to Wuhan’s health commission. The officials said an additional 163 people who have come into close contact with the infected have been placed under close observation. No deaths have been reported.
Several of the patients worked at Wuhan’s South China Seafood City, said the authorities, who shut down the market Jan. 1 to carry out daily disinfections. The 1,000-stall bazaar sold not only seafood but marmots, spotted deer and venomous snakes, according to state media reports that described the market as “filthy and messy.”
Videos from Wuhan showed the market barricaded in recent days and guarded by police wearing surgical masks.
The emergence of a new illness out of China has carried echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which infected more than 8,000 people, killed 774 and sparked mass panic as it spread across more than two dozen countries over eight months after starting in China in November 2002.
SARS is thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals, such as civet cats, and first infected humans in China’s Guangdong province, according to the World Health Organization. The tropical civet is sold and eaten as a delicacy in south China. The SARS epidemic delivered a political shock to the Communist Party, which was widely condemned for mismanaging the outbreak, covering up cases and smothering news reports.
Wuhan’s health commission, which has given relatively regular news updates, said the new pneumonia cases were not caused by SARS. It has also ruled out influenza, bird flu, adenoviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and said nucleic acid analysis was underway to identify the pathogen.
“There are now two key questions: What is the cause of the disease? Is it a brand new virus?” said Leo Poon, a Hong Kong University epidemiologist who was among the first to decode the SARS coronavirus. “Next: Is it transmissible between humans? We cannot yet rule out the possibility entirely.”

Because Wuhan authorities began quarantining and disinfecting the market on New Year’s Day, the number of new cases should taper off in the coming weeks, Poon said.
“But if there are additional cases, that may suggest human-to-human transmission” that would greatly complicate the situation, he added.
The WHO said it is monitoring the situation in China. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a low-level travel notice Monday, reminding travelers to practice “usual precautions” inside the country.
On Tuesday, the CDC said it has established an incident management structure to “optimize domestic and international coordination in the event additional public health actions are required,” according to a notice the agency sent to state health officers and public health emergency preparedness directors.
There are no known U.S. cases or any cases in any countries outside China, the CDC said. “But outbreaks of unknown respiratory disease are always of concern, particularly when there are possible zoonotic origins to the outbreak,” the CDC statement said.
On Wednesday, the CDC issued a health advisory to clinicians to consider pneumonia as a diagnosis for patients with severe respiratory symptoms who have been to Wuhan since Dec. 1, had illness within two weeks of returning and do not have another diagnosis that would explain their illness.
Public health experts say it is reassuring that no health-care workers have fallen sick. When the SARS outbreak began, the major alarm bells were illness in doctors and nurses and the spread of disease from person to person, said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
But while Chinese officials have ruled out several causes of the illnesses, they have not provided detailed information about what tests were performed, when they were done and at what point in the patients’ illnesses. Nor have Chinese officials provided a timeline of patient illnesses, information that is typically made public quickly in disease outbreaks.

“We’ve heard they ruled out SARS and MERS and other coronaviruses. There seem to be a lot of reports that this is a novel pathogen, but we haven’t seen the evidence,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the same center.
In the absence of additional information from Wuhan officials, other countries have announced additional measures, such as quarantine and fever screening at airports. If there is predictable and daily communication from Chinese health leaders in charge of the response about what is known and what is unknown about the outbreak, that “would tamp down some of the anxiety” about the disease and the response, Nuzzo said.
If the Wuhan pneumonia were found to be contagious, it could pose a major public health challenge coming just before the Lunar New Year holiday, when more than 400 million Chinese are expected to travel — including 7 million who vacation overseas.
In Beijing, the capital’s health officials this week called for “public health readiness” to respond to emergencies during the holiday period of Jan. 24-30.
In Hong Kong, 30 people who have visited Wuhan in recent weeks have been hospitalized with fever, and pharmacies in the city quickly sold out of face masks, local media reported.
The city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said Tuesday that authorities have rolled out new measures that would require Hong Kong’s doctors to report suspected cases and give city officials legal powers to quarantine suspected patients.
All travelers by high-speed rail from Wuhan will have their body temperature tested before entering Hong Kong, Lam said.
The Taiwanese government said eight people traveling from Wuhan have exhibited fever, and it was offering to send epidemiologists to Wuhan to help investigate.
Xu Jianguo, a former top Chinese public health official, struck an assuring note and said the government’s disease control capabilities today are much stronger than they were in the early 2000s.
“More than a decade has passed,” he said. “It’s impossible for something like SARS to happen again.”"

But they can pop up in any derivatives market and during turmoil driven by the spread of the coronavirus, volatility futures have, unusually and perhaps alarmingly, slipped from contango into backwardation. Here’s how to understand what that means and why traders care.
1. What are contango and backwardation?
Names for curve structures that map traders’ guesses about what a given contract will be worth in the future. Contango means upward sloping; backwardation, downward. In the oil markets, that means that if traders will pay more to lock in a shipment at a given price several months away than they would for delivery next month, the market’s in contango.
2. What does that mean for volatility?
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, as it’s known, is compiled based on the current state of trading in options -- contracts giving the right to buy or sell securities at specified prices in certain conditions. Traders often use these derivatives to hedge against market fluctuations. The VIX uses options prices for equities -- the amounts traders are willing to pay to be prepared for different outcomes -- to calculate what’s called the implied volatility for the S&P 500 Index.
3. Where is the VIX curve usually?
In contango. That’s because projections about the outlook for the S&P, like for the weather, normally become more uncertain the further into the future one looks. The VIX futures curve is based on options, and longer-dated options generally have more value than shorter-term ones.
4. What’s happening now?
The VIX futures curve is in backwardation. That’s a signal that investors expect more volatility in the near-term, as the world grapples with what the spread of the virus means for the global economy. Right now, shorter-term contracts are more expensive than longer ones. What’s particularly unusual about the current inversion is how deep it is beyond just the first two contracts, for March and April. The spread between the second and third-month futures contracts is at one of its widest levels during this bull market. Performance during other similar instances, like the markets’ reaction to China’s devaluation of the yuan in August 2015 as well as the debt ceiling drama and European debt crisis in 2011, suggest that it may take quite some time to digest the risks investors are grappling with at present.
5. What does that mean?
That market participants are preoccupied with the risk that’s right in front of their faces. That’s shown no signs of abating, with stocks on track for their worst week since 2011 as the spread between short and longer-term contracts became increasingly negative. Any narrowing of the gap, let alone a return to contango, would be a sign that conditions are normalizing.
6. Where do those terms come from?
That’s hard to say. But they’ve been around for a while. In Gilbert and Sullivan’s penultimate opera, “Utopia, Limited,” in 1893, a corporate shill is introduced with this: “A Company Promoter this with special education/Which teaches what Contango means and also Backwardation.”
7. And what was that about oil tankers?
Remember how that futures price curve is sloping upward in contango? If the oil traders are right, they can make money by buying oil at today’s spot price, selling a futures contract for delivery at the higher price expected in the future and storing the oil in the meantime. After oil prices crashed with the financial crisis of 2008, investors put 90 million barrels of crude into floating storage."

On Thursday, he completed his demolition job of expectations at the maker of everything from Durex condoms to Dettol disinfectant, saying the operating margin would be much lower in the future and announcing a 5 billion-pound ($6.5 billion) writedown to the value of the Mead Johnson baby-formula business, which Reckitt bought just three years ago for $17 billion.
Easing back on Reckitt’s margin expectations was essential, as it gives it the space to make some much-need investments to boost sales. Even in 2019, when its results were hurt by a poor flu season and the continued underperformance of Mead’s infant nutrition products, its operating margin was 26.2%, well ahead of Unilever’s 19.1% and Nestle’s 17.6%.
Reckitt aims to invest about 2 billion pounds over the next three years to try to deliver mid-single digit organic revenue growth. It rose by just 0.8% in 2019. Part of this will be funded by 1.3 billion pounds of cost savings. But there will also be a hit to the margin of 3.5 percentage points this year, much bigger than the market had expected.
Relaxing the margin also leaves room to change Reckitt’s hard-driving culture, which has historically obsessed about controlling costs and short-term earnings. Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies, anticipates an operating margin of 22.7% in 2020. The company wants to return to a margin percentage in the mid-20s eventually.
The new CEO has also signaled portfolio change. He has ditched a plan to split Reckitt into its hygiene and home business —  owner of brands such as the Cillit Bang cleaner and Vanish stain remover — and its health arm, which owns Nurofen painkillers and Scholl foot products. Reckitt will now remain as a single company, but with three divisions: hygiene; health and nutrition.
This structure, together with the whopper writedown, suggests that the nutrition business — primarily Mead Johnson — might be for sale at the right price. That is wise, given the poor performance of baby milk since Reckitt acquired Mead. The foray into formula under former CEO Rakesh Kapoor looks like a colossal waste of money. Reckitt also missed out on buying Pfizer’s consumer health unit, a far better fit, because it was busy digesting Mead Johnson and needed to cut debt.
Narasimham says Reckitt’s problems are operational. Still, fixing them won’t be straightforward, particularly with any coronavirus related disruption to consumption and supply chains. Given the economic context, the new growth and operating margin targets look a stretch.
Also, an activist investor might be tempted to push for a breakup if his strategy doesn’t work, particularly if the shares, which fell about 5% on Thursday, decline further. The now abandoned plan to split the hygiene and home division from the health unit might have delivered value."
"Feb 28, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/boris-johnson-threatens-to-walk-away-if-europe-doesnt-meet-his-demands-in-trade-talks/2020/02/27/4030135a-596e-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html,The Washington Post,Boris Johnson threatens to walk away if Europe doesn’t meet his demands in trade talks,"LONDON — Just days before formal trade negotiations are to begin, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday threatened that Britain would walk away from talks with the European Union in June if its demands for full control over its own rules and laws are not met.
Trade talks between two of the world’s top economies are set to start Monday in Brussels, with 10 teams and 200 negotiators huddling in conference rooms, trying to ink a deal on a vast range of topics, from the trade of goods and services to environmental protections, security, intellectual property, fisheries, workers’ rights and aviation safety.
Earlier this week, European ministers agreed on their goals for the talks, and Britain on Thursday announced its own mandate. And it is clear the two visions clash.
The European Union is demanding that Britain closely follow E.U. rules to maintain high standards, now and in the future, if it wants to continue to have tariff-free, quota-free access to the continental bloc, with its 450 million consumers.
For his part, Johnson has warned Europe that Britain did not go through the long agony of Brexit just to end up following Brussels diktats.
Complicating matters, Britain also wants to launch into trade talks with the United States this spring — as the U.S. presidential election goes into overdrive and the coronavirus threatens global economies.
Johnson insists Britain wants a relationship with Europe based on the “friendly cooperation between sovereign equals.” Britain “will not negotiate any arrangement in which the U.K. does not have control of its own law” and will not be subject to any “E.U. institutions, including the Court of Justice.”
Johnson said Britain wants a free trade deal like the one previously struck between the European Union and “friendly” nations such as Canada, Japan and South Korea.
But European leaders have told Johnson that Britain is not like Canada.
E.U. chief negotiator Michel Barnier said earlier this week that geography matters for trade deals, as the British port of Dover is only 21 miles away from the French port of Calais.
Because of the close geographical proximity between Britain and the continent — and because the two entities are already so closely interlinked — the E.U. wants Britain to guarantee that a “level playing field” between the sides will be maintained.
This means that Europe does not want Britain to gain any unfair advantage by weakening safety regulations, cutting environmental safeguards, rewriting labor laws — or deploying outsized state subsidies — that would help its companies outbid European competitors.
Johnson said Thursday that Britain could guarantee overall top quality for goods, without following every new regulation issued by Brussels.
“We’re not going to engage in some race to the bottom,” the prime minister said. “All we want is mutual recognition of each other’s high standards, and access to each other’s markets.”
Johnson said Britain would not demand that the E.U. follow every change in U.K. legislation. “So it doesn’t make any sense for them to make the same requirement of us, and that’s where we are,” he said.
Johnson has blinked in talks with Europe before, over what to do about the Irish border, but his government insisted Thursday that maintaining full sovereignty was nonnegotiable.
Britain will either sign a free-trade deal with the E.U. by December or it will leave with no deal, and trade with Europe as a third country, such as Australia, relying on World Trade Organization terms.
Such a hard exit could see the imposition of all sorts of new trade barriers, including customs duties and inspections for food safety.
Government economists in 2018 forecast that a Canada-style deal could reduce Britain’s economic growth over the next 15 years by 5 percent, while a deal similar to Australia’s would cost Britain’s economy 8 percent over the same time period.
If it is not clear by June that a deal to Britain’s liking can be quickly concluded, “the government will need to decide whether the U.K.’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion,” the British mandate says.
The two sides, too, are likely to clash over access to British fishing waters, as any restrictions will endanger the business model of European fishermen, who catch up to half of their harvest in British territory.
The other main worry for Europeans is the lack of preparations by the United Kingdom to manage customs and sanitary checks for goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which, according to the Brexit withdrawal deal, is supposed to remain aligned with E.U. regulations.
Johnson maintains that Britain will not be doing any such checks and that no new infrastructure is needed.
“We know the situation is fragile and peace is fragile,” Barnier said. “We know this protocol is complex. I’m not going to be over-impressed by rumors and talks. But what I’m interested in is what the British government will actually do.”"
"Feb 28, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-the-world-wants-haven-assets-and-what-they-are/2020/02/28/352c5adc-5a03-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html,The Washington Post,Why Havens Might Not Be Safe When Everybody Rushes In,"The coronavirus outbreak has set in motion a massive re-allocation of capital, as investors move money into so-called haven assets -- those thought to be safe in a global economic downturn. That’s brought turmoil in stock markets, record low borrowing costs for the U.S. government and higher prices for gold bracelets. It could also be creating new sets of risks. If enough worried investors pile into an asset class to drive its price high enough, and worst-case scenarios don’t come to pass, they may be locking in losses instead of avoiding them.
1. I know what a haven is. What’s a haven asset?
Merriam-Webster defines a haven as a “refuge” or “a place of safety.” In the financial markets, “haven asset” is applied to a range of assets, primarily those whose values are expected to rise when global market sentiment sours into a so-called “risk off” environment. They usually behave counter-cyclically, or tend to appreciate when the business cycle is in a downdraft. For debt securities, it’s those also deemed to have no -- or little -- credit risk, meaning you’re assured of repayment when the bond matures. Haven assets are also expected to be very liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold in big sizes with ease nearly anytime.
2. What are some examples?
Here are some of the haven assets getting the most attention:
• U.S. Treasuries are the global safe-haven asset of choice, as nobody expects the U.S. to default on its debt obligations. America’s ballooning deficit over recent years has created an ample supply of about $16.7 trillion. The suddenly insatiable demand by worried investors for the securities has sent long-term Treasury yields to all-time lows. Germany’s government debt also falls into this camp, with investor demand driving yields on its bonds of all maturities below 0%.
• Certain currencies. Among the more than $5 trillion in currencies traded each day, the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Swiss franc have tended to be favored havens (although not always, with the yen going a bit offsides lately). The International Monetary Fund has described currency havens as those from countries with relatively low interest rates and deep and liquid financial markets.
• Gold has long been a haven asset. When the prospect of strong returns elsewhere diminishes -- again think “risk off” -- gold becomes more attractive as a way for investors to get returns as the world sours. That’s why investor Warren Buffett says gold buyers are motivated by their “belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow.” Some people even have hidden gold underground, viewing it as the safest way to store their wealth.
• Within the world of stocks, avoided by many in a “risk off” period, some investors snap up lower-volatility shares and those of companies that produce goods that should remain in demand even if Armageddon arrives.
3. Are there risks when everybody does this at the same time?
Simple answer: yes! For starters, behind the rally in Treasuries lurks a potential disaster waiting to happen if any downturn gives way to a rapid rebound -- what’s known as a V-shaped recovery. That could send yields sharply higher and make prices tumble. That’s especially true because of the way so many investors have piled into long-term debt. The market’s growing duration -- a measure of how much prices will fall if yields rise -- is seen by some as a coiled spring ready to break. Some bond prices are also at their biggest gap from models of fair value in years, meaning that history suggests that the odds are greater that prices snap lower than that they keep rising. And quantitative strategists warn that low-volatility stocks have become very richly valued.
4. What does this mean for people who aren’t traders?
There’s good news and bad news for them. Those in the market to buy a house now may be able to set their sights higher as tumbling debt yields have sent mortgage rates lower, and millions of Americans are expected to lock in lower monthly house payments by refinancing. On the flip side, this might be a good month for ignoring brokerage statements, given that $3 trillion has been wiped off the value of U.S. stocks."
"Feb 28, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/28/william-barr-preaches-against-progressives-trump-is-one-sinning-against-democracy/,The Washington Post,"William Barr preaches against progressives, but Trump is the one sinning against democracy","Two weeks have passed since Attorney General William P. Barr complained that President Trump’s Twitter comments about current legal cases “make it impossible to do my job” and it has been more than a week since he was reported to have privately threatened to quit over the tweets. Trump has continued tweeting — he was fulminating against the forewoman of the Roger Stone jury on Tuesday as the judge was hearing motions in the case — yet Barr hasn’t quit.
And so the attorney general remains in a position to pursue what seem to be his favorite pastime: attacking secular “progressives” and propounding his own right-wing, religious vision of how the government should function. He was at it again on Wednesday during a speech to the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in Nashville. Barr’s erudite citations in the address could not disguise the ugly, extremist sentiments he espouses.
The theme of his address was that there is a battle going on in America today pitting proponents of “liberal democracy, which limits government and gives priority to preserving personal liberty,” against advocates of “totalitarian democracy, which seeks to submerge the individual in a collectivist agenda.”
The idea of “totalitarian democracy” is borrowed from a 1952 book by Israeli historian Jacob Talmon. He used the term to describe states such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which had some trappings of democracy but were, in fact, dictatorships. A more common phrase today is “illiberal democracy” — which is used to describe countries such as Hungary, the Philippines or Poland, where a strongman evokes the popular will to undermine the independent judiciary, freedom of the press, protection of minorities and other characteristics of liberal democracy. Barr displays his ideological blindness and utter lack of self-awareness when he ascribes these tendencies to his political opponents rather than to his own boss.
It isn’t the “so-called ‘progressive’ movement,” as Barr calls today’s liberals, that is undermining American democracy. It’s Trump with his pardons for politically connected criminals; his demands that his political enemies be prosecuted; his slander of the intelligence community, FBI and Justice Department; his interference in criminal cases involving his cronies; his attempts to use the threat of withholding military aid to coerce a foreign country into helping him politically; his incessant dishonesty; his purges of apolitical civil servants; his unhinged attacks on political opponents and his mistreatment of immigrants. Barr must be aware of all this, yet he apparently objects to none of it. Indeed, Barr has been Trump’s accomplice and enabler. No wonder more than 2,000 former Justice Department employees recently demanded the attorney general’s resignation.
The selectiveness of Barr’s outrage is breathtaking. He had the gall to complain in Nashville that there is a progressive plot against the hallowed doctrine of federalism: “We have come to believe that we should have one national solution for every problem in society. You have a problem? Let us fix it in Washington, D.C. One size fits all.” This, as Trump battles states that want to set their own emissions standards or refuse to cooperate with federal roundups of undocumented immigrants, because Trump believes that he always knows best. The president’s motto is “I alone can fix it.”
Barr’s hypocrisy on federalism was exceeded only by his hypocrisy on freedom of the press. He piously paid tribute to the “free press … as a check on the despotic tendency of democracy” before veering off into an attack on what his boss calls the “fake news media” and the “enemy of the people.” The attorney general complained that the “corporate — or ‘mainstream’ — press” has become “remarkably monolithic in viewpoint, at the same time that an increasing number of journalists see themselves less as objective reporters of the facts, and more as agents of change.” He said that this development jeopardizes the media’s “role as a breakwater for the tyranny of the majority.”
The attorney general seems unaware of the existence of an entire right-wing media industrial complex, led by Fox News, that peddles conspiracy theories and falsehoods advancing Trump’s political interests. (Just this week, some of Trump’s fervent media fans were claiming that coronavirus is an anti-Trump plot, because a senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the sister of former deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein, a one-time target of Trump’s ire.) That is truly a threat to the media’s role as a check on government abuse — but one that Barr doesn’t mention. Nor does Barr mention the threat posed to press freedom by his own boss, whose reelection campaign just this week sued the New York Times over an op-ed that was critical of him.
Perhaps Barr’s most bizarre statement was his contention that we need more religion in politics, because “religion tends to temper the passion and intensity of political disputes.” Has he never heard of the Thirty Years War — or the more recent conflict over abortion in America? Only in Barr’s fantasy-world is religious fervor a force for political moderation.
Barr is the second most dangerous man in America not only because he abets Trump in undermining the rule of law, but also because he seems determined to put a highfalutin’, pseudo-intellectual gloss on Trump’s power-grabbing. His Nashville speech was simply his latest attempt to make the indefensible appear acceptable."
"Feb 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-america-cant-escape-the-middle-east/2020/02/28/c0c227fa-5a5a-11ea-ab68-101ecfec2532_story.html,The Washington Post,Why America can’t escape the Middle East,"In the annals of disastrous revolutions, the popular uprising that swept the Middle East in 2011 now appears to be among the worst. The so-called Arab Spring disrupted tyrannies — a good thing, except when the alternative proves to be chaos. In Tunisia, birthplace of the uprising, the toppling of dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali has produced nine years — and counting — of failed attempts at popular government. That’s the “success story.” Egypt has traded one dictator for another, while Libya, Yemen and Syria collapsed into murderous civil wars.
Now, the Arab Spring has led, by bloody twists and turns, to a nightmare winter along Syria’s border with Turkey. Roughly 1 million homeless Syrians, most of them women and children, are suffering in bitter cold as Turkey battles a toxic alliance for control of its Syrian frontier. The chaos has brought NATO to the brink with Russia and threatens to renew the refugee crisis that has stretched the European Union to the breaking point.
To recap briefly: The uprising in Syria destabilized the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad but failed to drive him from power. In the years of civil war since, Assad’s efforts to restore his grip have been shockingly blunt and brutal, from chemical attacks on civilian targets to airstrikes on hospitals and schools. His chief allies are Iranian-backed militias and the Russian air force.
Assad’s grinding war has displaced more than half the country’s population. Some 3.5 million refugees are in Turkey, straining that nation’s resources. Millions more fanned out through Europe, sparking a backlash of anti-immigrant nationalism. Assad is now battling Turkish-backed rebels in their last strongholds, the Idlib province and parts of Aleppo in northwestern Syria.
Since the start of the offensive in December, indiscriminate bombing and shelling have wreaked appalling havoc. The United Nations reports: “More people have been displaced into a smaller area within a shorter period of time than ever before, with nowhere else to flee. The risk to civilians from the violence is extreme, as international laws and norms are disregarded, at the same time as cold weather and economic stresses affect them. Many people have fled with nothing, unable to bring even basic supplies with them . . . others fled with everything they had, attempting to bring as much as possible because they do not expect to be able to return to their homes. Humanitarian workers and other service providers are themselves being displaced, and facilities and supplies worth millions of dollars have been lost as infrastructure is destroyed.”
Last week, Turkey, a NATO member, blamed Russia for an attack that killed at least 33 Turkish troops, further raising the stakes of this disaster. Vladimir Putin responded by sending warships from his Black Sea fleet steaming along the Turkish coast through the Straits of Bosporus toward Idlib. As tensions escalate, Turkey reasonably expects the support of the Western alliance, and to make sure support is forthcoming, Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced he was opening his borders to allow Idlib’s huddled masses access to Europe.
If the continent struggled with earlier waves of Syrian refugees, imagine how Europe will react to 1 million impoverished, malnourished immigrants on the move in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic. It’s a xenophobic nationalist’s dream scenario, and a severe threat to the open, cooperative, free-trading ethos of the Brexit-battered European Union.
Perhaps now President Trump understands why former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was so determined to keep U.S. Special Forces in northern Syria as a stabilizing element, and why he resigned over Trump’s decision to pull them out. Since 9/11, U.S. presidents have been blundering into the Middle East and blundering to get back out, surging troops, withdrawing troops, drawing red lines only to ignore them later, and cheering the demise of some despots while cozying up to others. We’ve tried everything but strategy.
The Middle East confounds the American political discourse. Whether we are promoting a foreign intervention or criticizing it, we measure our actions against fairy-tale measures of moral purity. We want to side with good guys against bad guys, with freedom against tyranny, with the light against the darkness. In the end, we want a tidy victory with a bow on top — anything less is defeat.
This region is where fairy-tale illusions go to die. But as Trump is now pulled back into the complex ugliness of the Syrian crisis, the lesson should be that the United States cannot escape the Middle East. It is the crossroads of planet Earth and the brain stem of human culture. Its problems will always press on the world’s agenda, and for the foreseeable future, those problems will be managed, at best — never solved. The disappointment of the Arab Spring naturally makes us want to leave it all behind. But the very failure of the revolution shows why the Middle East is inescapable."
"March 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-wins-south-carolina-primary-potentially-reshaping-the-democratic-race/2020/02/29/20117978-5b0e-11ea-ab68-101ecfec2532_story.html,The Washington Post,"Joe Biden wins South Carolina primary, reshaping the Democratic race","COLUMBIA, S.C. — Former vice president Joe Biden decisively won the South Carolina primary Saturday, as the first Southern primary contest reshaped the race and dealt a blow to the surging candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The win pumped new life into Biden’s struggling campaign, as he became the first candidate to score a clear-cut victory against Sanders this year, boosting his efforts to become the major alternative to the liberal senator. Still, Sanders (I-Vt.) is polling strongly in several of the Super Tuesday states that vote this week, and it could yet prove difficult for any of his competitors to catch up.
At a minimum, Democrats now face the most unsettled contest in decades, with several candidates showing a potential to win delegates after the winnowing process of the first four primary states. The Democratic race goes national Tuesday, when 14 states and one territory will vote to award 34 percent of the convention delegates.
What’s not clear is whether Biden’s triumph in a state supporters have long called his “firewall,” where African American voters had a significant say for the first time, will provide only a momentary lift, result in a two-person race between Biden and Sanders — or result in a long slog to the convention.
Still, it was a major win for a figure who has been in public life for 45 years, and his first primary victory in his three presidential runs. Cheers went up at 7 p.m. at a Biden election-night rally in Columbia when MSNBC called the race, and again at 7:04, when the channel was switched to CNN. Biden cast the win as the first of many number of dominoes that will now fall his way, noting that some were counting him out just days ago.
“Now, thanks to all of you — the heart of the Democratic Party — we just won and we won big . . . and we are very much alive,” Biden said in a victory speech that was pointed directly at Sanders.
“We have the option of winning big or losing big. That’s our choice,” Biden told a raucous crowd in Columbia. “We have to beat Donald Trump and the Republican Party, but here’s the deal: We can’t become like them. . . . We can’t have a never-ending war.”
The Biden campaign hopes to use Saturday’s win to consolidate support from many of his rivals, hoping that several drop out — which one of them, businessman Tom Steyer, did shortly after the polls closed. “Honestly, I can’t see a path where I can win the presidency,” Steyer said in announcing his decision.
Biden also plans a series of high-profile endorsements over the coming days. Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (D-Va.) and former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe announced shortly after Biden’s win that they were backing the former vice president.
Nearly half of South Carolina voters said Rep. James E. Clyburn’s (D-S.C.) final-week endorsement of Biden was an important factor in their vote, according to exit poll results from Edison Research.
Sanders, speaking in Virginia Beach, Va., Saturday night, sought to put the results in perspective, ticking off his previous strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.
“But you cannot win ’em all . . . and tonight we did not win in South Carolina,” Sanders said. “And that will not be the only defeat. There are a lot of states in this country, and nobody wins them all.”
After congratulating Biden, he proclaimed, “And now we enter Super Tuesday — and Virginia!”
For all the candidates but Sanders, a further winnowing of the field is crucial to winning the nomination. Sanders is broadly expected to come out of Tuesday with a substantial delegate lead in the race, anchored in his huge polling advantage in California. Under party rules, such leads can be difficult to overcome as the race moves on.
With most precincts reporting, Biden was poised to win about half the vote, giving him a symbolic victory over Sanders, who did not win more than 34 percent of the vote in any of the first three states. Under party rules, nominees need to secure more than 50 percent of delegates to win the nomination at the convention in Milwaukee in July.
But the continued viability of so many candidates has increased the likelihood that no candidate will be able to secure such a victory with initial pledged delegates alone, setting up the potential for either a brokered convention or a pre-convention horse trading of delegates by the candidates.
Complicating the hunt for the nomination is former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars advertising his candidacy to the Super Tuesday states, after deciding not to compete in the first four contests.
Although his rise in polls had slowed since his first debate performance, Bloomberg still appears positioned to win delegates in many early states, as he continues to swamp his rivals in spending.
His advisers vowed Saturday night that Bloomberg will stay in the race at least through Super Tuesday, when he will appear on the ballot for the first time. They cited internal campaign data showing that if Bloomberg dropped out it would strengthen Sanders, whose left-leaning policies the former mayor abhors.
“Mike Bloomberg has not been on the ballot yet,” said Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey. “Our campaign is focused on organizing Democrats and building infrastructure in states all around the country.”
His campaign announced Saturday that he will buy three minutes of commercial airtime nationally at 8:30 p.m. Sunday night to present his vision for managing the current coronavirus outbreak, which claimed its first American life this past week in Washington state.
After Saturday’s outcome became clear, President Trump tweeted, “Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign.”
Biden’s support among black voters, who made up most of the electorate in South Carolina, appeared ready to lift a campaign that has struggled to find its footing for more than a year. Biden, a national polling leader in 2019, finished in fourth place in Iowa, fifth place in New Hampshire and second place in Nevada.
African American voters are a crucial pillar of the Democratic coalition, and Biden, along with other Sanders critics, have argued that it will be hard for the Democratic nominee to defeat Trump if he does not have enthusiastic support from the black community. Sanders has replied that he alone among the Democratic contenders has shown the ability to electrify voters and draw big crowds from a broad portion of the electorate.
Before polls closed, Clyburn, who has promised to campaign for Biden in North Carolina next, voiced strong criticism of the operation he was joining.
“If we are successful tonight in this campaign, if he has a relaunch,” he told CNN, “I think we will have to sit down and get serious about how we retool this campaign, how we retool the fundraising, how we do the [Get Out The Vote]. And at that point in time, many of us around the country will be able to join with him and help him get it right.”
Steyer had invested heavily in South Carolina, spending $23.6 million on advertising out of the $36 million spent by all of the candidates, according to the tracking firm Advertising Analytics. But the results showed he did not get a big return on his money.
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who came in first in Iowa and second in New Hampshire, left South Carolina long before voting results came in, a tacit admission of his campaign’s low expectations in the state.
His inability to build trust among black voters, despite his early momentum, proved damaging in the state, where he regularly appeared at events designed to appeal to black voters but failed to draw many attendees.
His campaign staff has shifted to a more target-specific strategy for Super Tuesday, advertising heavily in specific parts of the country, like the Sanders stronghold of Vermont and Norfolk, to boost his delegate haul. The campaign, advisers say, is focused on getting to the 15 percent margin threshold required by party rules to win delegates in as many places as possible.
“I think there is going to be after Super Tuesday a real focus on narrowing the field,” Michael Halle, a strategist for the Buttigieg campaign, said in a call with reporters Saturday. “The candidate or candidates who are closest to the margin are going to be able to stay in.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), once seen as among the strongest candidates, had another disappointing showing, after finishing third in Iowa, fourth in New Hampshire and fourth in Nevada. But her campaign has been encouraged by a recent increase in fundraising following two solid debate performances, and she has been helped by an outside group spending millions of dollars in states that vote Tuesday to help her campaign.
Warren also won the endorsement Saturday of Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Weingarten was acting in her personal capacity — her union decided to support Biden and Sanders as well as Warren — but as a major figure in the labor and education worlds, her backing could carry weight.
The other player in the race is Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose home state of Minnesota will vote Tuesday. She also has an aggressive travel schedule over the coming days and has been competing on television in several states, both from her campaign and a supportive outside group.
The South Carolina primary provided sharply different guidance for the party than the previous three contests. But the bigger role of black voters, along with broader concerns about Sanders’s effect on Democratic prospects in a general election, up and down the ballot, appeared to have given Biden a second chance.
“Look, I’m very optimistic about today, and I’m very optimistic about the process,” Biden told reporters at a polling place in Greenville earlier in the day.
He said his campaign had been bringing in “about a million dollars a day over the last week or so, and if we win solidly here I think it’s going to raise a lot of money as well.”
“The bigger the win, the bigger the bump,” he said."
"March 2, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/super-tuesdays-viral-politics/2020/03/01/9b3ff5da-5be4-11ea-9055-5fa12981bbbf_story.html,The Washington Post,Super Tuesday’s viral politics,"Former vice president Joe Biden’s sweeping victory in South Carolina turned him into the only viable alternative to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, but there may also be a more subtle force at work in the primaries of Super Tuesday: the coronavirus and the fears it has inspired.
If a majority of Democrats was intent on the question of who can beat President Trump even before the virus’s outbreak, Trump’s partisan, divisive and fact-denying response to the crisis underscored just how dangerous it would be to keep him in office for four more years.
This could push primary voters even harder to consider the question of whom they trust most to wield power in the Oval Office.
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg tried to capi­tal­ize on this feeling with an ad in which he talked about the threat of the virus in a setting that made it look as though he was already president. But Biden hopes that he will be the main beneficiary of the public’s uneasiness because it will reinforce his underlying appeal to the value of experience, the virtues of safety and the need to restore stability in governance.
Yet Biden has just days to convert his South Carolina landslide into delegates in the 14 states at stake on Tuesday. And early voting will complicate his task.
Democrats who made their choices before South Carolina did so before the contours of the Biden-Sanders confrontation were defined. This means that former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who left the race Sunday night, as well as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Bloomberg already have votes that might otherwise have shifted to Biden. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren also has her share of early votes, although a significant number of her voters might have gone to Sanders rather than Biden.
There is also the tricky math of Democratic Party rules, which could swing scores (and perhaps hundreds) of delegates in California. It awards 144 of its delegates on the basis of the statewide vote and 271 by congressional district. A candidate who receives 15 percent of the votes statewide wins a share of those at-large delegates. A candidate who falls under 15 percent gets none. If only Sanders passes the threshold, he wins all 144 of those statewide delegates.
Polls suggest that Sanders is poised to win a substantial California victory. Biden has hopes now that his South Carolina success may allow him to get over the threshold, which he desperately needs to do. But holding off a Sanders runaway in the biggest state may require at least one more candidate to hit the threshold, too. It’s not clear if any of them can, although the surveys suggest that Warren may be in the best position to do so.
Then there is the Bloomberg Effect. Bloomberg, who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars across Super Tuesday states, could help halt a Sanders delegate pileup by hitting the threshold in states such as Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Oklahoma and perhaps Tennessee. But Bloomberg’s presence could also stop Biden from winning outright in those states.
A recent Public Policy Polling survey in Texas pointed to Biden’s Bloomberg problem. It offered respondents two scenarios: one with Bloomberg in the race and one without him. With Bloomberg in, Biden was neck-and-neck with Sanders. Without Bloomberg, it showed Biden winning Texas rather handily. But in real life, Bloomberg is on the ballot, and more recent polls suggest Sanders had opened a lead.
Last, Biden will be rooting for Klobuchar to win her home state of Minnesota and Warren to win in Massachusetts. Sanders is strong in both states.
What Biden does have is momentum and endorsements. Without a lot of cash, he is counting on Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and former governor Terry McAuliffe to push his message across in Virginia. Biden hopes for the same in California from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, former senator Barbara Boxer, former CIA director Leon Panetta and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Sanders will say it’s all a sign of “the Establishment” ganging up on him. It’s a risk Biden is more than happy to take.
But the main effect of South Carolina may be on Biden himself. After a series of primary and caucus losses, the former vice president was looking beleaguered and tired, reinforcing fears among Democrats about his own “electability.” His victory speech on Saturday — focused, moving and strategic — began to ease those doubts.
Biden has a long way to go, and Sanders will always enjoy a big enthusiasm edge. But Biden now has at least some evidence for his case that he is not only the nominee most likely to beat Trump, but also, in an anxious moment, the most plausible president."

U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss, an Obama appointee, said the administration violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 when it placed Cuccinelli, a conservative activist and former attorney general of Virginia, in charge of the agency that runs the nation’s legal immigration system.
The ruling amounts to a rebuke of Trump’s stated preference for filling top administration jobs with officials serving in an “acting” capacity. The president has said he prefers having top officials in an acting role because he thinks it makes them easier to remove than those with Senate confirmation.
USCIS officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.
Immigrant advocacy groups sued the administration last year on behalf of five Honduran asylum seekers — two adults and three children — who challenged the legality of the new restrictions on multiple grounds. Moss’s ruling addressed the first of their claims: that Cuccinelli lacked the authority to change U.S. asylum policies in the first place.
Moss agreed, writing that the vacancy rules require a federal agency’s “first assistant” to assume leadership when the top job is open.
“Cuccinelli’s appointment fails to comply with the (law) for a more fundamental and clear-cut reason: he never did and never will serve in a subordinate role — that is, as an ‘assistant’ — to any other USCIS official,” Moss wrote.
The administration’s move to place Cuccinelli in charge was therefore unlawful, he wrote, and the policy memos he signed should be “set aside.”
Those include measures in July to reduce the amount of time afforded to asylum seekers to seek legal counsel after crossing the border and to restrict the ability of U.S. asylum officers to grant applicants extensions.
The implications of the judge’s ruling were unclear Sunday for other policy moves and administrative decisions made by Cuccinelli since Trump installed him in June. Cuccinelli remains in the top job at USCIS, and he is serving as the second-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, where he has been appointed to the White House’s coronavirus task force.
Senior staffers at DHS and USCIS have repeatedly expressed doubts about the legality of Cuccinelli’s authority, with several unclear about where he actually works.
According to his official biography page online, his title is senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, and he is also the senior official performing the duties of the director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services."

Two years later the young coalition collapsed amid an all-too-familiar mix of political intrigue and horse trading that stems in part from an entrenched system of affirmative action policies that critics say fosters cronyism and identity-based politics. The political upheaval has brought back elements of the old regime into a shaky new government that is confronted with public discontent over a weakening economy just as the coronavirus outbreak hobbles the country’s main trading partner, China.
1. Why did tensions boil over?
Two veteran politicians, Mahathir Mohamad and Anwar Ibrahim, pulled off a shocking election victory in 2018 that ousted then-Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was enmeshed in a massive money-laundering scandal linked to the state investment first 1MDB. Mahathir, now 94, became prime minister again (he held the post from 1981 to 2003), with the understanding that he would hand over to Anwar at some point. Delays in setting a date -- as well as policy disputes within the unwieldy coalition -- led to tension that boiled over in late February. Mahathir abruptly stepped down and became interim prime minister, saying he wanted to form a unity government that would be more likely to listen to him. But the king pre-empted his efforts on March 1 by naming Mahathir’s erstwhile right-hand man, Muhyiddin Yassin, as Malaysia’s eighth prime minister since independence from the U.K. in 1957.
2. There’s a king?
Malaysia is a parliamentary democracy along the lines of the U.K., except instead of one constitutional monarch the title rotates every five years among the rulers of nine Malay states. The king, known as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, usually stays on the sidelines performing ceremonial duties, but is involved in major appointments like that of prime minister.
3. Who is Muhyiddin?
A 72-year-old career politician who rose through ranks of the once-ruling United Malays National Organisation party. He was Najib’s deputy for six years before he was sacked in July 2015 after calling for greater clarity in the 1MDB investigations. He later joined forces with Mahathir to set up a new party, Bersatu, and became home affairs minister in the new government. A cancer survivor who’s generally low-profile, he’s perhaps best known for quipping in 2010 that he considers himself “Malay first” and Malaysian second.
4. What does ‘Malay first’ mean?
Almost two thirds of the country of some 31 million people are ethnic Malays, who are overwhelmingly Muslim. There are also large ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities who are Christian, Buddhist and Hindu. Government policies give preferential treatment to Malays, traditionally seen as disenfranchised, in such areas as public-sector jobs, housing and higher education. Critics say the preferences have fostered cronyism and a dependence on state handouts and have prompted many educated minorities to look for work overseas, draining the economy of talent. But they are something of a “third rail” in Malaysia’s polarized politics. Mahathir’s appointment of Lim Guan Eng as finance minister, the first ethnic Chinese to hold the post in over four decades, sowed suspicion among Malay nationalists that their benefits would be eroded, costing the coalition support.
5. So what can we expect?
Mahathir and Anwar, who are also Malay, had campaigned on a “New Malaysia” agenda aimed at boosting good governance -- including prosecuting Najib and his wife for corruption. Mahathir had appointed the country’s first female chief justice and lifted bans on previously blacklisted journalists. The parties in the new government, including Najib’s UMNO, are supporting a more conservative agenda favoring Malays, including measures to promote a stricter version of Islam.
6. What about the economy?
It’s already growing at the slowest pace in a decade amid the rapid spread of a virus that’s wreaking havoc on travel and supply chains across Asia. (Projections are for a 3.2% to 4.2% expansion of the commodity-reliant economy this year, down from an earlier forecast of 4.8%.) Mahathir had unveiled a 20 billion ringgit ($4.8 billion) stimulus package to support affected businesses, particularly in the tourism industry. Oil-related earnings also are in decline amid weak crude prices, adding headwinds for exports and potentially undermining the Muhyiddin-led government’s capacity to boost infrastructure, lift income and rein in government debt. Even before the virus, recent surveys found rising living costs and a lack of jobs had replaced corruption and abuse of power as voters’ top concerns.
7. What about foreign relations?
It’s not clear yet what Muhyiddin’s policy will be. Malaysia has long been seen as one of Southeast Asia’s most stable countries and enjoys relatively warm relations with China, its biggest trading partner. It is participating in China’s ambitious infrastructure program known as Belt and Road, although Mahathir canceled one deal and renegotiated another last year to cut costs. While Mahathir has regularly denounced the Trump administration over its trade policies and its Middle East peace plan, the U.S. is Malaysia’s largest source of foreign-direct investment. According to the U.S. State Department, the two countries cooperate closely on security matters, including counterterrorism and regional stability.
8. What does it mean for investors?
With some from the old government back in power, Mahathir has expressed concerns of possible political meddling in the legal process, which could undermine investor confidence. Snap elections could be called if the new government proves unstable. The key stock index, which has been one of the world’s worst-performers since the 2018 election, slumped to its lowest since 2011 a day after Muhyiddin’s appointment. The ringgit has been trading around its lowest level in two years."
"March 2, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/03/02/bubonic-plague-coronavirus-quarantine-eyam-england/,The Washington Post,Bubonic plague was so deadly an English village quarantined itself to save others,"It was called the Black Death. And it was far deadlier than coronavirus.
As governments around the world impose quarantines to prevent the spread of covid-19, it is worth remembering the extraordinary story of Eyam, England, the Derbyshire village that faced an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the 17th century.
In September 1665, George Viccars, a tailor’s assistant in Eyam, unloaded a bundle of flea-infested blankets from London. Bubonic plague had recently broken out in the capital in the latest wave of a centuries-long pandemic that swept throughout Europe and the Middle East, killing millions.
Within a week, Viccars was dead. Panic set in. Six weeks after the outbreak, some 29 Eyam residents had died.
The parish staggered through the winter, with the number of deaths dropping. In May, there were no deaths at all, and the villagers believed the outbreak was over. But the disease had mutated. “Instead of having to contract the disease by a flea-rat-flea human cycle of infection” says local historian Francine Clifford, “it got into the lungs and became pulmonary.”
By June 1666, Eyam’s newly arrived rector William Mompesson realized the need to contain the disease and began to formulate a quarantine plan. Eyam lay on an important trade route between Sheffield and Manchester; if plague got into those cities, thousands would die. But this was England in the wake of a religious civil war, with the Crown restored just five years earlier. So Eyam residents were skeptical of their new priest and remained loyal to the Mompesson’s Puritan predecessor, Thomas Stanley, who was living in retirement on the edge of the village.
Mompesson persuaded Stanley of his plan, and, despite their religious differences, they called a meeting in the parish church and appealed the crowd to voluntarily isolate the village. Believing they faced near-certain death if they remained but could cause the death of thousands if they left, the residents of Eyam agreed.
A quarantine cordon was established with a one-mile radius marked by a ring of stones. For 14 months nobody went in or out of the village. Food was left at the boundary stone by nearby townspeople in exchange for gold coins submerged in vinegar, which villagers believed would disinfect them. The death-rate skyrocketed.
During its seclusion, Eyam suffered. Bodies piled up; families were instructed to bury their own dead on the outskirts of town.
One woman, Elizabeth Hancock, buried six of her children and her husband inside a month. Mompesson himself described the village in one of his letters: “My ears have never heard such doleful lamentations. My nose has never smelt such noisome smells, and my eyes have never beheld such ghastly spectacles.” His wife, Catherine, died on August 25, 1666. It was, he said, “a Golgotha; a place of skulls.”
Measures were taken within Eyam to limit cross infection. Sermons were held outside, bodies were no longer wheeled through the street and some villagers left their homes to camp on the surrounding hills. “It was extremely foresighted of them,” says Clifford, “because that’s not the way things were normally done.”
In all, 260 of Eyam’s estimated 800 residents perished during the quarantine, more than double the mortality rate of the Great Plague of London. But Mompesson and the villagers’ self-sacrifice had worked. The plague never spread to nearby towns and, 14 months later, in November 1667, the quarantine was lifted.
“It was very successful because nobody outside the village ever contracted the disease,” says Clifford, who has lived in Eyam for 36 years.
In 1842, William Wood, one the Eyam survivors’ descendants, wrote in a history of the village: “The immortal victors of Thermopylae and Marathon have no stronger claim to the admiration of succeeding generations than the villagers of Eyam; who in a sublime, unparalleled resolution gave up their lives — yea: doomed themselves to pestilential death to save the surrounding country.”"

If global warming continues unabated, an area as large as 3,400 football fields in the center of the small city-state could be inundated by 2100, flooding the vital business district and some of its most valuable infrastructure. 
Many coastal cities share a sinking feeling nowadays, but Singapore’s example stands out for a couple of reasons. First, the island is choosing fight over flight. Second, the fiscally conservative nation is asking current taxpayers to share the cost of an expensive battle, even though the worst of the threat will only materialize if Antarctica and Greenland lose their ice in the second half of the century.
Most other vulnerable countries aren’t as rich as Singapore, or as space-constrained. The Philippines is moving government offices from disaster-prone Manila to the higher ground of a former U.S. Air Force base in Clark City. Indonesia is erecting a new capital in the jungles of Borneo, even as it aims to put up a giant wall to shield Jakarta from ocean waves. But where will Singapore, a sovereign state packed in an area three-fifths the size of New York City, go?
One option is to emulate the Pacific Ocean island of Kiribati, which has bought land 2,000 kilometers away in Fiji. The Maldives has explored resettling its population in Australia. But how does Singapore leave behind a strategic port, the world’s best airport, humming refineries and data centers, and gigantic underground reservoirs of crude oil? How does it recreate a megalopolis for 5.7 million residents and several times as many visiting bankers, businessmen and tourists? 
Sitting at the mouth of one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, separating peninsular Malaysia from the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, Singapore has nowhere to go. What it has are money and a forward-planning DNA, both of which it has used successfully in the past to stop getting its arm twisted over the supply of raw water from Malaysia. But as existential threats go, climate change will be a lot trickier. “We cannot lose a big chunk of our city and expect the rest of Singapore to carry on as usual,” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his national day speech last August, in which he gave an indication of how costly the fight could get:  S$100 billion ($72 billion) over 100 years, possibly more.
Put another way, Singaporeans will invest what it cost the U.S. in today’s money to build its first transcontinental railroad in 1869; and they will keep repeating that feat every year and a half for a century.(1)A survey found that for 21% of citizens and permanent residents, the emphasis on climate change was the most “impressive” part of Lee’s address.
The investment will be high as the ocean tries to wrest back what the island’s planners took from it to accommodate their outsize growth ambitions. Some of the priciest real estate is standing on soft marine clay in reclaimed lands in downtown Singapore and the central business district, according to a recent study. This clay is subsiding. The combined effect, the scientists say, could be to flood as much as 18 square kilometers — 21% more area than rising sea levels alone would.
So what’s to be done with all that spending? Options include “empoldering,” a Dutch system of reclamation in which newly drained land sits lower than the sea, protected by a dike. Rainwater gets pumped out into an inland water body, which throws its excess into the surrounding sea. When Singapore embraced this innovation to expand an outlying island — the main city is surrounded by 62 of them — the idea was to save on sand costs. But polders are now being seen as a technique to arrest the sinking of Singapore.
Next comes financing. Six months after the prime minister’s speech, the government put S$5 billion into a coastal and flood protection fund. That’s a bold commitment when the coronavirus epidemic is threatening to disrupt trade and tourism and destroy jobs. Yet, Singapore wants to make an early down payment and go ahead and raise a politically sensitive consumption tax to 9% from 7%, sometime between 2022 and 2025. Earlier, aging-related healthcare costs were the main reason to marshal resources. Now, taxpayers are also on the hook to protect future generations from the sea.
It’s a delicate balance between survival in 2100, votes in the next elections that are likely later this year, and sustaining long-term competitiveness. Singaporeans aren’t exactly happy with their rising retirement age. But the government has already increased income taxes on top earners to 5 percentage points more than arch rival Hong Kong. Any more and they might leave. Higher consumption taxes are the only solution. 
Still, not all of the burden can be front-loaded. Inter-generational justice will be important in allocating climate costs. Yet-to-be-born Singaporeans won’t get a free pass. Laws make it difficult for the government to raid the nation’s substantial past reserves, whose size is a state secret. But converting financial assets into improved land, which is what empoldering will entail, is allowed more easily because it isn’t a depletion of coffers. Any funding gaps could be filled with long-term borrowings to be repaid by future taxpayers. Climate bonds are a small but growing asset class. If AAA-rated Singapore issues a steady supply, it will be lapped up by global pension managers starved of yields.
The city last year imposed a S$5-a-ton tax on greenhouse gases, though its own emissions are just 0.1% of the world total. It’s the large economies whose behavior will determine how boldly Singapore must spend. Just as the city with no resources became a global role model for recycling dirty water for drinking, what it does to fight climate change and how it finances the investment could show other countries a way. At a minimum, Singapore’s seriousness will give investors a good idea of whether coordinated global action against rising temperatures is a realistic goal, or a pipe dream. Think of the world as a rickety coal mine, and tiny Singapore might be its canary. With a S$100 billion song on its lips.
The Union Pacific, which built the line westward from Omaha, spent $60 million, or $1.1 billion in today’s money. There’s no firm estimate for how much Central Pacific, which built eastward from Sacramento, invested."
"March 2, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/a-30-oil-price-is-the-real-virus-threat-to-opec/2020/03/01/c69652a8-5b92-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html,The Washington Post,A $30 Oil Price Is the Real Virus Threat to OPEC,"It’s finally upon us. The week when ministers from the oil producing countries of OPEC and their allies meet to decide on the future of their latest round of output cuts. Having failed to persuade Russia to bring the meeting forward, Saudi Arabia will now hope to convince its biggest non-OPEC ally of the need to make deeper cuts in the face of a demand slump triggered by the Covid-19 virus. Success is not a foregone conclusion and failure will be costly.
The looming pandemic has already made its mark on oil markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude is now firmly below $50 a barrel and global benchmark Brent briefly followed it on Friday. That is uncomfortable territory for producers everywhere and, without a clear indication of deeper output cuts from this week’s meetings, prices will fall further.
As the virus spreads, locking down Italy’s industrial heartland and prompting Switzerland to ban large gatherings, producers appear to be clinging to overly optimistic demand assessments. OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo, speaking at a conference in Saudi Arabia last week, said that in spite of the new coronavirus, the world’s “thirst for energy will continue to grow.”  While that may be true for energy as a whole, it may not be for oil demand this year if there isn’t a quick rebound.
Assessments from the three main forecasting agencies still show 2020 oil demand growth running close to a million barrels a day, but that now looks very optimistic. By contrast, veteran energy consultants FGE cut their forecast for growth this year to “almost zero.”
They base their pessimism on the ripple effects of the virus beyond China, where traffic volumes in affected cities have already slumped, according to data from the TomTom Traffic Index. Measured in terms of how much longer journeys take than they would on empty roads, live data show that traffic volumes in Beijing are still well below normal levels, even as the city is reportedly returning to work.
In Wuhan, center of the epidemic in China, there is no such uptick; economic activity remains severely curtailed.
But this is no longer just a Chinese problem. The economic impact of the spread of the virus to other parts of the world is clear. Four-week average jet fuel demand in the U.S. has dropped by 18% in the past 10 weeks. Airlines are cutting flight schedules and passenger numbers have collapsed. An acquaintance of mine flew back from Australia last weekend on a plane he reckons was only about one-third full. As people have second thoughts about getting on flights if there’s no guarantee those around them aren’t infected, flight schedules will almost certainly be cut further, with obvious implications for fuel demand. Consultants JBC Energy have cut global demand growth for the fuel to just 50,000 barrels a day this year, little more than a third of what they saw a month ago.
And those TomTom figures show the impact of the virus on traffic in Milan after its discovery in northern Italy. Morning rush-hour journey times have been cut by a quarter, as fewer cars clog the roads.
A similar pattern is emerging in OPEC nation Kuwait, where the virus has spread from neighboring Iran.
This is the situation that will face the oil ministers of the 23 nations in OPEC+ later this week. They need a credible plan that will take actual barrels off the market, even if Russia balks at making further cuts. Its compliance has been poor, but Saudi Arabia seems willing to accept that in return for the perception of added clout that it thinks Russia’s presence at the table brings.
I have no doubt that an agreement will be hammered out in Vienna — or via a virtual meeting if the gathering is cancelled. (There are no signs yet that it will be, though OPEC continues to monitor the situation in Vienna). The cost of failure is too great. It “would leave the market vulnerable to a short-term swing below $30 a barrel,” analysts Emily Ashford and Paul Horsnell from Standard Chartered said in a report.
Oil traders will remain hard to convince that producers are doing enough, or reacting quickly enough. Saudi Arabia’s oil supplies to China are set to fall by a third in March as demand withers. The kingdom is pressing OPEC+ producers to agree to collective production cut of an additional 1 million barrels a day — even that may no longer be enough."

That’s brought turmoil in stock markets, record low borrowing costs for the U.S. government and higher prices for gold bracelets. It could also be creating new sets of risks. If enough worried investors pile into an asset class to drive its price high enough, and worst-case scenarios don’t come to pass, they may be locking in losses instead of avoiding them.
1. I know what a haven is. What’s a haven asset?
Merriam-Webster defines a haven as a “refuge” or “a place of safety.” In the financial markets, “haven asset” is applied to a range of assets, primarily those whose values are expected to rise when global market sentiment sours into a so-called “risk off” environment. They usually behave counter-cyclically, or tend to appreciate when the business cycle is in a downdraft. For debt securities, it’s those also deemed to have no -- or little -- credit risk, meaning you’re assured of repayment when the bond matures. Haven assets are also expected to be very liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold in big sizes with ease nearly anytime.
2. What are some examples?
Here are some of the haven assets getting the most attention:
• U.S. Treasuries are the global safe-haven asset of choice, as nobody expects the U.S. to default on its debt obligations. America’s ballooning deficit over recent years has created an ample supply of about $16.7 trillion. The suddenly insatiable demand by worried investors for the securities has sent long-term Treasury yields to all-time lows. Germany’s government debt also falls into this camp, with investor demand driving yields on its bonds of all maturities below 0%.
• Certain currencies. Among the more than $5 trillion in currencies traded each day, the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Swiss franc have tended to be favored havens (although not always, with the yen going a bit offsides lately). The International Monetary Fund has described currency havens as those from countries with relatively low interest rates and deep and liquid financial markets.
• Gold has long been a haven asset. When the prospect of strong returns elsewhere diminishes -- again think “risk off” -- gold becomes more attractive as a way for investors to get returns as the world sours. That’s why investor Warren Buffett says gold buyers are motivated by their “belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow.” Some people even have hidden gold underground, viewing it as the safest way to store their wealth.
• Within the world of stocks, avoided by many in a “risk off” period, some investors snap up lower-volatility shares and those of companies that produce goods that should remain in demand even if Armageddon arrives.
3. Are there risks when everybody does this at the same time?
Simple answer: yes! For starters, behind the rally in Treasuries lurks a potential disaster waiting to happen if any downturn gives way to a rapid rebound -- what’s known as a V-shaped recovery. That could send yields sharply higher and make prices tumble. That’s especially true because of the way so many investors have piled into long-term debt. The market’s growing duration -- a measure of how much prices will fall if yields rise -- is seen by some as a coiled spring ready to break. Some bond prices are also at their biggest gap from models of fair value in years, meaning that history suggests that the odds are greater that prices snap lower than that they keep rising. And quantitative strategists warn that low-volatility stocks have become very richly valued.
4. What does this mean for people who aren’t traders?
There’s good news and bad news for them. Those in the market to buy a house now may be able to set their sights higher as tumbling debt yields have sent mortgage rates lower, and millions of Americans are expected to lock in lower monthly house payments by refinancing. On the flip side, this might be a good month for ignoring brokerage statements, given that $3 trillion has been wiped off the value of U.S. stocks."

President Trump has boasted that a trade pact with Johnson would be “fantastic and big.”
Trump has heaped praise on Johnson for his winning campaign to leave the European Union. Both leaders have promised that once the United Kingdom is free of Europe’s regulatory shackles, a boom in transatlantic trade is in the offing.
But in the best-case scenario, in a tariff-free and quota-free deal, trade between the two countries would increase by $20 billion over the next 15 years, according to the British government.
The United Kingdom’s end of that? About $4.3 billion by the mid-2030s.
One reason for the relatively humble sum is that Britain and America already do a brisk trade in goods and services — some $280 billion in 2019.
Britain is the world’s fifth-largest economy, and the United States is its largest trade partner after the European Union, accounting for 19 percent of all exports and 11 percent of imports in 2018.
In an analysis published Monday by Britain’s Department for International Trade, in anticipation of U.K.-U.S. trade talks set to begin in coming weeks, economists forecast that a free-trade deal with the United States could boost the British economy by 0.16 percent. Brexit critics say that incremental increase will not come close to compensating for the economic hit Britain is forecast to suffer by leaving the European Union’s single market next year.
No matter, Britain is raring to make a start, talking with U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, who was in London last week. About 100 negotiators from the two countries will probably start shuttling across the Atlantic in coming weeks.
The talks face brisk geopolitical head winds, as they are set to begin during the middle of a presidential election, alongside a possible coronavirus pandemic. The negotiations will also run in parallel with Britain’s attempt to strike a new post-Brexit deal with the E.U., which has its own set of demands that run contrary to U.S. interests.
Speaking ahead of the release of Britain’s trade negotiating mandate, Johnson on Monday said, “We have the best negotiators in the business, and of course we’re going to drive a hard bargain to boost British industry.”
The prime minister said, “Trading Scottish smoked salmon for Stetson hats, we will deliver lower prices and more choice for our shoppers.”
And while the dollar benefit might not be all that fantastic, Johnson said the most important thing is, “this transatlantic trade deal will reflect the unique closeness of our two great nations.”
Congress and the Trump administration will surely press Britain to open its markets to American agricultural goods.
Britain, while a member of the European Union, essentially banned imports of the United States’ hormone-injected beef and its chlorine-washed chickens.
On Monday, Britain’s international trade secretary, Liz Truss, told the BBC, “We will not diminish our food safety standards.”
She also said the country’s National Health Service “is not on the table,” nor will Britain bend to see the United States set the prices that the NHS pays for drugs.
“Those are two very clear red lines in our trade deal,” she said."

That’s Bloomberg. Mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013. Democrat, then Republican, then independent, then Democrat. Purveyor of fancy data terminals. Ninth-richest person in the world. A few months ago Bloomberg saw a moribund field of candidates and thought he could vault his way to the nomination through a delegate grab on Super Tuesday.
So now it’s mike, responsible presidential candidate, asking for the car keys as the nation stumbles around.
Is he trying to save the party, or accidentally sabotaging it? Is “mike” just a proxy for Bloomberg as he tries to buy the presidency?
“My first answer to that all the time is: What’s the right price to save democracy from Donald Trump?” said Tim O’Brien, a senior adviser to mike, at a Bloomberg house party in McLean, Va., Thursday night. There, Northern Virginians sipped Chianti and canned Perrier and whispered about Joe Biden as if he were an uncle in hospice care (this was 48 hours before his defibrillation in South Carolina). They shuddered at the thought of Bernie Sanders, democratic socialist, for his perceived radicalism and dismissed Elizabeth Warren, capitalist reformer, for her vendetta against mike.
What’s a democracy worth? A year ago, before mike arrived on the scene, Bloomberg pledged a half billion to vanquishing Trump. In Virginia, over the past three years, he spent $3.5 million to help flip the statehouse to Democrats, whose gun-control advocates now speak of him with reverence. So far this year, Bloomberg has spent $50 million to pepper online platforms with advertising. Now, mike is in your Facebook feed. He’s in your Google search results. Every time you glance at the television, he’s there. The 2020 presidential candidates have spent $26 million on TV ads in Texas alone; 80 percent of that was for mike, according to Advertising Analytics. One ad cost $4.3 million all by itself, and said that mike has “la fuerza para enfrentar a Trump” (the strength to face Trump).
He’s created an entire economy. mike’s campaign officially began 13 weeks ago, but already Bloomberg has spent more on his campaign than the Texas city of Arlington (population: 400,000) has in its annual budget. The least senior members of his staff of 2,000 make $6,000 a month (nearly twice their counterparts’ wages on Team Warren and Team Sanders). He has deployed an army of meme makers, enlisted mural artists to transform campaign spaces and hired at least one comedian to secretly punch up his speeches. This past weekend he zoomed to Super Tuesday states in private jets to headline campaign events with free booze and barbecue.
He knows money might not buy him love, but maybe it can buy him like.
“He’s the best person to win,” said Rennea Henn, 71, standing in a sea of “I LIKE MIKE” signs at a rally at a former airfield in San Antonio Sunday night. She doesn’t like Sanders and that “gimme gimme” mentality she believes he instills in the kids. She would happily vote for Biden, but even after the former vice president’s boffo victory in South Carolina, she is concerned about his unevenness. “He said he had four women he wanted to pick for VP, and he couldn’t even remember their names,” Henn said.
Rewind to Friday, when mike hopscotched eastward across Tennessee in private jets: He rallied 1,000 people in downtown Memphis, where a handful of protesters hoisted signs that said “Oligarch,” “What is your price?” and “Our Democracy is not for sale.” At a distillery in Clarksville, near the Kentucky border, mike corked a barrel of bourbon in front of a friendly crowd, while a couple of dozen protesters outside carried Trump-Pence flags and signs like “Mini Mike take a hike.”
“I won’t talk until the cows come home,” mike said inside, pausing for laughter that didn’t come. Then: “They told me that would work in Arkansas.” (He’d been in Arkansas the previous day.)
mike knows he can’t land a joke. mike knows that he’s not charismatic. mike knows that the New York City Police Department’s stop-and-frisk policy got out of control when Bloomberg was mayor, and mike is sorry about that. But he would like you know that he’s good in a crisis, that’s he a “pragmatic problem-solver,” that he can bedevil Trump while consolidating support to defeat him.
Bloomberg’s millions have helped solve at least one problem, which has to do with mike’s age. When 38-year-old Pete Buttigieg suspended his campaign Sunday night — thereby stepping on mike’s paid prime-time “address” on the coronavirus — the top of the field got hopelessly geriatric, with Warren as spring chicken at age 70. At 78, mike is older than Biden by nine months, and younger than Sanders by five, but Bloomberg’s $500 million investment has bestowed mike with the appearance of vigor, steadiness and omnipresence. It has threatened to render sentimental and obsolete the retail politics of Iowa and New Hampshire. Americans shop online and buy what’s on TV, and that’s where mike is meeting them. He never looks tired.
It has also bought a ground game for the virtual candidate.
“We’ve built the biggest infrastructure that Texas has ever seen,” said Ashlea Turner, mike’s state director. On the ground in Texas he’s got 19 field offices and 180 paid staffers, including Amanda Salas, 33, who grew up conservative, supported John McCain in 2008, Bernie Sanders in 2016, and now has settled in the middle with mike.
“I gotta look at what people in my electorate are looking at: solid Democrat but pretty conservative,” said Salas, while door-knocking Saturday in a Hispanic neighborhood of San Antonio.
The mike campaign has seven full-time staffers in the remote islands of American Samoa, according to CNN, as part of a play to lock down the U.S. territory’s six delegates.
Tennesseans, who vote Tuesday, are shocked to be lavished with attention by a Democratic candidate at this stage. mike has seven offices in Tennessee, including ones in Jackson and Johnson City, in largely rural areas on either side of the state that rarely see this kind of action from a presidential candidate.
Ernest Brooks, a councilman from the city of Jackson in West Tennessee, accepted Bloomberg’s apology for stop-and-frisk and praised his economic initiatives for black Americans.
“It’s been many, many presidential cycles” since a candidate set up an office in his county, said Brooks, a paid surrogate. “Decades.”
On Friday in Blountville, near the Virginia border, mike spoke in a Trumpian setting: an airplane hangar with a gargantuan American flag behind him. Included in the buffet of pulled pork and casserole were two vats of banana pudding so big that the candidate could’ve bathed in them. There were a couple MAGA hats in the crowd of 350. A man under one of them was named Craig Widner.
“I don’t like hardly any of what Mike Bloomberg stands for,” said Widner, who owns an insurance business, “but I do respect that he had the guts to show up in East Tennessee for an event that’s probably not gonna work out well for him.”
The main goal was not to win outright but to walk away with delegates, and to be prepared for a brokered national convention in Milwaukee in July. Last week, popular distaste with this strategy manifested in spray paint (“Eat the Rich”) on the campaign office in Johnson City, Tenn.
“When people make comments that he’s buying the election, I’m very put off by that,” said regional field organizer Kristi Carr. “Because all I have is awe that a candidate would invest their own money in my home state and my home region that has never had that kind of investment before.”
Out in Kingsport, mike’s sole canvasser Friday was a 16-year-old named Carrson Everett. He’s the founder of his high school’s club for Democrats (membership: 15) and president of the county’s society for young Democrats (membership: five). Carrson was originally for Bernie Sanders, but was turned off by his supporters and liked what he heard at the opening ceremony for mike’s office in Johnson City. Carrson can’t vote, but he can knock on doors.
“I get irritated with Democrats who are not in red areas because I think they feel like, ‘Well, I just don’t need to do anything,’ ” he said while canvassing in Kingsport. “And I’m like, ‘We are working our butts off out here!’ ”"
"March 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/03/israeli-politicians-are-biggest-threat-country-faces/,The Washington Post,Israeli politicians are a growing threat to their country,"Israel-watching is a split-screen activity this week. On Sunday afternoon, more than 18,000 people assembled in Washington for the start of the annual AIPAC policy conference, where they will celebrate Israel’s achievements and its resilient partnership with the United States. Meanwhile, an ocean away, despondent Israelis dragged themselves to the polls on Monday in the country’s third general election since April.
Never has the juxtaposition of “the thrill of victory” and “the agony of defeat” — to quote the old “Wide World of Sports” opening — better described a national predicament.
While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasts of unprecedented coordination with the Trump administration and other global actors, Israel’s domestic politics are a shambles. A transitional government with limited authority to make major decisions has managed affairs of state since the 20th Knesset was dissolved in December 2018. Making matters worse, the frustrating hat-trick of elections, at a cumulative cost of almost $3 billion, has come at the very tangible expense of other spending priorities such as the construction of hospitals and classrooms.
The irony couldn’t be greater. At the same time that Israel and its advocates are toiling — with no small degree of success — to repel challenges to the legitimacy of the Jewish state, a growing menace to the nation’s validity looms from its own citizens. Israelis are distraught over the recklessness of their stewards. Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin put it succinctly. “When the nation witnesses its leaders spewing hatred at one another, boycotting entire communities and seeking votes via a strategy of divisiveness,” he lamented in January, “what is left for them to believe in?""
Ugliness was the defining characteristic of the just-ended campaign, in which wiretaps played a starring role. Last Friday, Benny Gantz, head of the Blue-White Party and Netanyahu’s chief competitor to form Israel’s next cabinet, fired his chief strategist after a recording surfaced of the aide confiding that Gantz represented “a danger to the people of Israel.” (It soon emerged that Netanyahu himself was involved in the leak.) Across the aisle, longtime Netanyahu consigliere Natan Eshel was caught with his pants down after he was heard disparaging Netanyahu’s core “non-Ashkenazi” base of Israelis whose families originated from the Middle East and North Africa. “They hate everything and we’ve succeeded in whipping up that hatred,” Eshel postulated, summarizing smugly that “hatred is what unites our camp.""
Other malicious shenanigans also may have influenced Monday’s vote directly and unfairly. Netanyahu’s Likud Party was accused of releasing internal survey data over the weekend, in open contravention of Israel’s election laws. Gantz alleged Sunday that Netanyahu was sowing fear of coronavirus outbreaks in Blue-White strongholds to keep voters away from the ballot box. Fake-news scares came against the backdrop of Netanyahu’s dubious smear against the judges presiding over his upcoming corruption trial as “leftists,” a seemingly invented charge that he then dared them to deny.
Turnout was key to the results. Having endured two recent elections in close succession, Israelis already knew where their allegiances lie. The main decision that faced members of the electorate was whether to come and vote their conscience or just stay home. Many said half-jokingly that they would take a break this time and return to perform their civic duty in a fourth ballot after the summer. To the extent that exit polls can be taken as reliable — and assuming that the numbers do not fluctuate significantly — the Likud and its satellites apparently proved able to bring out their supporters and prevail as the largest faction in the incoming Knesset. Whether they will control a governing majority remains unclear for now.
And the larger problem confronting Israel is that Monday is always followed by Tuesday — and the rifts within its famously cohesive society will not be healed any time soon. Earlier hopes of crafting a unity government have been buried ostensibly in the wake of the acidic contest and its lingering, bitter taste. But even if Netanyahu and Gantz are somehow able to overcome their differences, join forces and grant Israel a measure of stability, public confidence will be scarred still by the sudden about-face of two men who pledged vehemently not to place Israel's fate in each other's hands.
With neither bloc holding an easy lock on the prime minister's office in Jerusalem, the nasty political wrangling is destined to continue. A Netanyahu triumph will wind up being adjudicated inevitably before the High Court of Justice, which refused in January to issue a “premature” ruling on the matter of his fitness for office while under criminal indictment; no matter what verdict the judges reach, loud voices of protest will emanate surely from one partisan camp or the other. The only manifest, if tenuous, alternative to a Netanyahu-led coalition would be a minority government headed by Gantz. These are not outcomes with the potential to restore trust among a consensus of Israelis in their elected officials.
The zero-sum polarization that has infected Israel and more than a few other countries around the world is precarious. It compromises the ability of legislators and governments to conduct pressing business responsibly in a way that serves the collective interests of all — and not just some of — their people.
With hot conflicts on its borders, Israel can ill afford this toxic schism within its borders. New, prudent leadership and sensible electoral reform would seem like obvious places to begin repairing what’s broken. Otherwise, it shouldn’t come as a surprise when nobody shows up to vote in the next deadlocked election — which could still be just around the corner."
"March 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/hong-kongs-property-insiders-are-in-buy-mode/2020/03/02/0b86dcc0-5ce2-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html,The Washington Post,Hong Kong’s Property Insiders Are in Buy Mode,"A deadly virus outbreak following months of anti-government protests might seem like a toxic cocktail for the world’s least affordable property market. Yet Hong Kong’s real estate insiders are in buy mode.
The plan by the family of Peter Woo to take Wheelock & Co. private suggests that those with the most privileged vantage point see a limit to any virus-induced decline in property prices, and consider there’s value to be extracted by removing assets from the public markets. It may not be the last such maneuver.
That might seem surprising. A widely followed index of residential prices compiled by Centaline Property Agency has dropped only 6.5% from its record high in June last year. The Hong Kong government forecasts the economy may contract as much as 1.5% this year, as the virus disrupts business, scares off tourists and damps spending. In the fourth quarter, gross domestic product shrank 2.9% from a year earlier, the worst performance since the depth of the global financial crisis in 2009.
The explanation lies in the divergence between publicly traded share prices and values of the underlying real estate. Hong Kong property companies trade at deep discounts to their book value, meaning that taking a company private can be a value-enhancing proposition even if property prices continue to fall.
Wheelock is a holding company whose principal assets are its controlling stakes in publicly traded Wharf Real Estate Investment Co. and Wharf Holdings Ltd. The Woo family, which owns 67% of Wheelock, is offering one share each of Wharf REIC and Wharf Holdings, plus HK$12 ($1.54) cash for each share held in the privatization. The deal values Wheelock shares at HK$71.90 each, or 52% more than the last trading price before the stock was halted on Feb. 24.
That’s not as generous as it might appear. Wheelock was trading at a 64% discount to its its estimated end-2020 book value before the offer, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The median forward price-to-book ratio of companies in the Bloomberg Intelligence Hong Kong real estate group is 0.47 times. The discount has widened from 0.51 times as the end of 2018 as record property prices prompted investors to discount the risk of a future tumble.
Woo isn’t the only business owner to take such a step. Hopewell Holdings Ltd. was delisted by its then-83 year-old founder Gordon Wu last year. And in 2016, New World China Land Ltd. was taken private by the controlling Cheng family.
The discount on Hong Kong property shares also reflects the dominance of controlling family shareholders, which fuels concern among investors that minority interests may come second. By contrast, shares in Singapore’s REITs tend to be more widely held. Even some of China’s debt-laden real estate developers command higher valuations because investors see them as more aggressive in pursuing growth. China Evergrande Group, for example, trades at 1.3 times book value.
At some point, though, prices can become too cheap, calling into question the value of maintaining a listing — and offering majority owners the chance to pick up assets from minority investors for less than they might fetch in the market. In 2010, Wheelock was trading at 0.85 times book.
Wheelock’s prospects may be better than those of its subsidiaries. Wharf REIC and Wharf Holdings are largely focused on shopping malls and offices, with assets such as the Times Square development in Hong Kong’s prime Causeway Bay shopping district, which have been badly affected by the slump in tourism and drop in Chinese business activity. For its own account, Wheelock is also a developer of mass residential housing, where prices have stayed resilient. Hong Kong home supply remains tight and interest rates and leverage are low. Wheelock managed to sell apartments at its Lohas Park project in the eastern district of Tseung Kwan O even at the height of the protests last year.
It’s telling that bidding for land sold by the government has remained heated amid the coronavirus outbreak. Last month, Wheelock outbid eight other developers for a site in Lohas Park that could provide 2,000 homes.
Wheelock isn’t the only unloved Hong Kong developer. The Jardines group-controlled Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., the biggest office landlord in the central business district, trades at 0.3 times forward book. There’s a similar valuation for Kerry Properties Ltd., a builder of luxury housing owned by Malaysian billionaire Robert Kuok. Both were trading at about 0.5 times at the end of 2017.
Keep an eye on developer share prices. As malls remain half-empty, some tycoons may be doing some home shopping of their own."

Multiple states reported new cases over the weekend, and more are likely to emerge in the next few days. It’s becoming clear that the country isn’t as prepared, and its early response wasn’t as robust as President Donald Trump has claimed.
The administration is starting to do some of the right things. It’s working to boost testing capacity, and that will help health workers get a handle on the spread of the disease and aid in containment; health officials are also now looking for cases entering the country from outside of China. These steps came far too slowly, however, leading to missed opportunities to catch and prevent infections.
Because of the peculiarities of the American health-care system, the U.S. can’t only seek to replicate measures that have worked in other countries if it’s going to have the best possible chance at containing the Covid-19 virus. There is a long list of other actions worth taking within days rather than weeks.
In areas where there appears to be community spread, it’s time to consider school closures, event cancellations, and to encourage people who can telecommute to do so. Considering that the virus may have been working its way through Washington state for as long as six weeks, it’s worth preparing for the possibility of broader quarantines as well. These are severe and highly disruptive steps, and as my colleague Faye Flam notes, they’ll be especially tricky to institute in the U.S. It’s worth the disruption and potential pushback to prevent overloading hospitals and putting older adults at risk of severe disease. 
Such public health measures only succeed if people do what they’re supposed to and self-quarantine when ill or seek treatment if they have severe symptoms; unfortunately, the U.S. health-care system has put barriers in the way of doing the smart thing.
Millions of Americans lack health insurance entirely, while many more face high deductibles and other out-of-pocket health costs. If a Covid-19 test costs thousands, many will avoid getting them. Meanwhile, an inpatient stay at a hospital is dramatically more expensive, which means people may put themselves in danger by delaying treatment. On top of that, America is also one of the worst developed countries in the world at making sure employers guarantee paid sick leave. Weak employee protections have spent years conditioning people to avoid care and go to work even if they’re ill.
What can the government do? For one, it can potentially designate some Covid-19 treatment and tests as preventative services that will be free for people with coverage because of protections granted by the Affordable Care Act. It can also direct emergency funds toward making sure that costs don’t dissuade people from seeking help and that they aren’t bankrupted for doing so. The government also should encourage firms that don’t provide compensated time off to make an exception for this virus; helping to pay for that leave is another good use of emergency funds. The alternative is that sick people may end up preparing your food. All of these measures have to be instituted rapidly and widely publicized if they’re going to have any impact. 
Alongside these shorter-term efforts, investment in longer-run projects should be increased. The priority needs to be scaling lab diagnostics to the point where anyone with symptoms can get tested. The development of a more rapid point-of-care test that doesn’t need to head to an overtaxed lab will aid containment efforts. It should be a well-funded priority alongside the development of possible treatments. 
These steps will be difficult and may contribute to further economic disruption. They’re worth it to avert the human and financial costs of uncontrolled spread of this virus. "
"March 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-election-netanyahu-gantz/2020/03/03/76d44616-5cbf-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html,The Washington Post,"With most votes counted, Netanyahu’s surprise showing gives him edge in Israeli election","JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu moved quickly Tuesday to take advantage of his strong showing in Israel's election, signaling a willingness to negotiate with almost any politician as he races to form a government before his corruption trial begins in two weeks.
With 97 percent of the vote in Monday's election tabulated, Netanyahu's unexpectedly large lead was holding firm. The preliminary results showed his Likud party with 36 parliamentary seats, erasing its losses from the previous election last year and making it once again the country's largest party.
If the results hold, his right-wing bloc will command 59 seats, two shy of a majority in the parliament, or Knesset, and the prime minister wasted no time seeking out other parties or lawmakers willing to join his team.
Members of his coalition told reporters they were open to a deal with any party other than the Joint List of Arab parties. Netanyahu's spokesman told Israeli radio that the prime minister's coalition had already made overtures to four potential defectors from left-leaning parties.
But it remained unclear whether he will prove any more successful than after the two previous elections in assembling a majority. Both of those efforts ended in political deadlock, depriving him of a record-breaking fifth term and sending Israelis back to the polls.
Some political observers had said Netanyahu was irreversibly weakened after the longest-serving leader in Israel's history failed to achieve a majority in those previous elections, with his support in decline.
The man known as Israel’s political magician now faces a pair of challenges if he is to stage a comeback: hold successful coalition negotiations and prevail in his upcoming trial on bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust charges.
The election results could still change as officials count final batches of votes from military bases, overseas diplomats and special biohazard polling places set up for voters quarantined because of possible exposure to the coronavirus. (Senior election officials, unable to find workers willing to open the doubly-sealed ballots, were planning to conduct the count themselves in a tent outside the parliament, according to media reports.)
But Israel was well into dissecting Netanyahu’s feat. Polls for months had shown little change in the grinding stalemate that has kept Israel from forming a new government for more than a year.
But in the final weeks, as the Blue and White party and its leader, Benny Gantz, worked down a list of what critics disparaged as overly staid hanger rallies around central Israel, Netanyahu worked tirelessly to electrify his base and reawaken thousands of Likud voters who had reportedly sat out the previous election.
Likud launched what political reporters described as an unprecedented voter-targeting operation. The 70-year-old prime minister appeared all across the country, beseeching supporters to personally lobby their fellow Likud party members and encouraging them to upload video of him to social media.
By the end, in a country exhausted by the nonstop politicking of three straight elections, Netanyahu appeared to dig deeper.
As a candidate, Netanyahu “has phenomenal power,” Topaz Luk, the prime minister’s head media adviser and strategist, said in an interview the morning after the election. “Netanyahu went out to the field this time and did so many rallies.”
Gantz, a former army chief of staff, based his campaign almost entirely on being a measured, ethical alternative to the controversial, divisive and criminally indicted prime minister. Although a majority of votes cast Monday were not in support of Netanyahu, Gantz’s message and manner could not prevent his rival from shouldering past him.
“There is no doubt that Netanyahu enters these coalition negotiations from a strengthened position,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. “Last time he had 55 seats, and now he has 59 seats, so it gives him more options and more legitimacy. The opposite is true for Blue and White, who have gone down.”
Netanyahu has two possible routes to a majority. One is to poach individual Knesset lawmakers. Orly Levy-Abekasis of the Gesher party sparked speculation when she tweeted Monday night that she “hopes to wake up tomorrow to a new era of action.” She removed the post a short time later, after journalists asked whether she was suggesting her willingness to join a right-wing coalition.
The prime minister’s other path is to entice an entire party. Already Tuesday, there were signs that some previously unthinkable deals were being weighed, most notably a merger between the two biggest parties, Likud and Blue and White. The two sides failed to reach a power-sharing agreement after previous elections, and Gantz has vowed never to partner with Likud as long as Netanyahu remains in charge.
But Netanyahu seemed to be leaving that door open in an election night speech that spared Gantz any criticism, even as his Likud supporters chanted for him not to join forces with Blue and White.
And Blue and White may be calculating that Netanyahu’s trial on bribery, fraud and breach of trust, scheduled to begin in two weeks, might put him out of commission in any case.
Netanyahu, who has railed against the justice system, claiming it is biased against him, could now drive the country into a constitutional crisis. He refused to resign following his indictment, raising unexplored questions about a criminal defendant’s ability to perform a prime minister’s duties.
By Tuesday morning, one advocacy group had already petitioned Israel’s High Court to block Netanyahu from being tasked with forming a government in the first place.
“It is unthinkable that a prime minister sit in the defendant’s dock in the morning and run the security cabinet in the evening,” Eliad Shraga, head of Movement for Quality Government, said in a radio interview."
"March 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/03/sanders-is-terribly-risky-nominee-so-is-biden/,The Washington Post,Sanders is a terribly risky nominee. But so is Biden.,"The stampede to Joe Biden’s side among Democrats in the wake of his victory in a single primary has been remarkable to behold. What they are unlikely to say out loud is that this isn’t about Biden’s inspiring vision or compelling personality, so much as their fears that if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were the nominee, he’d lose to President Trump. Biden, for all his weaknesses, looks like a better bet.
I can’t say for sure that they’re wrong. There are no certainties here, and no way to account for every variable that could affect the outcome of the election, let alone events that we can’t foresee.
But what we ought to realize is that both Sanders and Biden represent a huge risk to the Democrats — but for completely different reasons.
To simplify things a bit, I fear that Sanders would do everything right and fall short because he was fated to lose, while I fear that Biden would do everything wrong and blow a race he could have won.
Let’s start with Biden. His victory in South Carolina does not change the fundamental fact that he is simply terrible at running for president — even worse than in his disastrous runs in 1988 and 2008. Those who are on the campaign trail will tell you that he is showing his age — he starts sentences then can’t find his way out of them, he’s surly when challenged, and he says cringeworthy things on a daily basis. His debate performances have ranged from barely acceptable to abysmal.
So how much confidence do you have that Biden wouldn’t find a way to screw this up?
It’s possible that he can win over voters in the middle who are tired of Trump and that Biden offers the reassurance of an old white guy who talks a lot about how we can all get along if we just wind the clock back four years and pretend Trump never happened. But it’s also possible, if not likely, that Biden will prove to be an uninspiring candidate of the kind Democrats have ridden to defeat so many times before, one who will lose more votes through the deadening of turnout than he’ll win by converting Republicans.
Yes, he’s getting support from African American voters — so far, anyway — but they already vote at relatively high rates, comparable to white voters. The big untapped potential for Democrats lies in young people and Latinos, neither of whom seems particularly jazzed about a Biden nomination.
Despite Biden’s insistence that he’ll beat Trump “like a drum,” it isn’t hard to imagine Trump gutting him like a fish. Republicans in Congress are already ramping their “investigation” of Hunter Biden back up, and you can bet they’ll use that story to cast a pall over Joe Biden as corrupt or just vaguely untrustworthy.
And Biden’s history on issues like criminal justice and Social Security gives Trump ample ammunition to run against him from the left, a demobilization strategy designed not to convince anyone that Trump is better on those issues but to make Democrats withdraw in disgust and decide not to vote.
And what about Sanders? He could be just as problematic a nominee.
The first reason is the obvious one: He’s farther to the left than any nominee we’ve had in pretty much forever. There’s a good potential that his views on policy — especially when run through the ringer of an unsympathetic media and a highly motivated opposition — will come to seem dangerous, even frightening. I might be sympathetic to most (though not all) of his proposals, but there’s no denying that he proposes radical change.
Depending on what happens with the coronavirus, to many voters the status quo, particularly the economic status quo, may seem pretty good, and even if they don’t like Trump, they’ll take him over a future that they’ve come to find unsettling. You can see that in the many stories emerging about disgruntled Republicans and independents saying they’ll vote for a Democrat — unless it’s Sanders. Right now those are just anecdotes, but they could begin to pile up into something more threatening to his prospects.
Sanders says he’ll solve all these problems with an unprecedented turnout wave, particularly among those young voters. But so far there isn’t much to suggest it’s happening. Turnout in the primaries has been reasonably strong, but not unprecedented — and not all benefiting him. The fact that many politically involved young people are excited about Bernie Sanders does not necessarily mean that huge numbers of young people who aren’t politically involved will inevitably become excited about Bernie Sanders.
That’s not the only reason to be skeptical. While Sanders might not depress Democratic turnout in the way some other candidate might, his ability to bring significant numbers of new voters in — without simultaneously motivating higher turnout among Republicans that would cancel it out — is for the moment a proposition without evidence to back it up.
Up until now, general election trial heats have shown both Sanders and Biden beating Trump pretty much every time. But we should never assume that what people think of the eventual nominee now tells us much about what they’ll think of him in October, once the full power of Trump’s disinformation machine is aimed at him, not to mention a news media that is likely to repeat the “But Her Emails” debacle of 2016.
You might find one of these two stories more persuasive than the other; chances are it’s the one that matches up with the preference you already have for one or the other candidate. But the fact is that neither of the two men with the best chance of being the Democratic nominee looks like a strong general election candidate.
Sorry if that fills you with dread; that’s certainly how I feel. But it’s the truth."
"March 4, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/03/with-his-dni-picks-trump-is-trying-corrupt-intelligence-community/,The Washington Post,"With his DNI picks, Trump is trying to corrupt the intelligence community","There is so much alarming news in the world that it’s easy to lose sight of the president’s slow-motion assault on American democracy. Case in point: On Friday evening, following the worst week for the stock market since 2008, Trump announced that he would be nominating Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) as director of national intelligence (DNI). This is a jaw-dropping decision because Trump had already announced and withdrawn Ratcliffe’s nomination last summer in the face of bipartisan resistance.
Critics pointed out that Ratcliffe lacked the “extensive national security expertise” that is a statutory requirement for the job. As The Post notes: “After Trump put Ratcliffe forward last year, it emerged that he had overstated his experience as a federal prosecutor in eastern Texas, claiming to have put terrorists behind bars when there were no significant terrorism prosecutions in that district while he was the U.S. attorney there.”
Trump had chosen Ratcliffe not because he knew anything about intelligence but because he had shown himself to be a slavishly loyal defender of the president with no regard for the truth or the Constitution. Ratcliffe had distinguished himself, if that’s the word, with his obnoxious and insulting interrogation of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III in July, followed by his shameless defense of Trump during the impeachment hearings.
Ratcliffe was one of those Republicans who pretended that Trump had done nothing wrong by trying to extort Ukraine into helping him politically. During one hearing, he asked State Department officials George Kent and William Taylor: “Where is the impeachable offense?” Taylor attempted to respond that they were there as fact witnesses, not to judge whether the president’s conduct warranted impeachment, but Ratcliffe cut him off, saying “I’ve got one minute left” and then “I withdraw my question.” Eventually Taylor was able to answer, but Trump jumped on Taylor’s initial hesitation to claim, as Ratcliffe no doubt intended, that he had just been exonerated.
Throughout the impeachment process, Ratcliffe was not a disinterested fact-finder but, rather, a rabid partisan defending Trump at all costs. Ratcliffe didn’t just vote no on the articles of impeachment but “hell no,” and he faithfully echoed his master in denouncing this “fake impeachment scheme.” Trump rewarded his poodle by appointing him to his defense team in the Senate — and now nominating him to be DNI.
It’s unclear whether Ratcliffe will be confirmed by the Senate this time around, but even if he is ultimately rejected, Trump has still won, because nominating him resets the clock on how long an acting DNI can serve. In mid-February, Trump fired acting DNI Joseph Maguire after one of his aides briefed Congress on Russian attempts to interfere in the U.S. election and admitted that the Russians had a preference for Trump. Trump replaced him with Richard Grenell, a Twitter troll who is now ambassador to Germany and is embarrassingly unqualified to be DNI.
Grenell would have trouble getting hired as even a junior CIA analyst because of his past public relations work on behalf of a shady Moldovan oligarch (according to ProPublica) and an organization funded mostly by the authoritarian Hungarian government (according to The Post). But there is no way to stop Grenell from running the entire intelligence community. He has already begun purging professional intelligence officers and installing Trump toadies. Grenell forced out Deputy DNI Andrew P. Hallman, a well-respected CIA veteran, and hired Kashyap Patel, a former aide to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) who is notorious for spreading “deep state” conspiracy theories. Patel now has a mandate to “clean house,” according to CBS News.
Without a new nominee for the DNI post, Grenell would have had to step down on March 10 under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. But now he can serve for the rest of Trump’s term. As law professor Stephen I. Vladeck of the University of Texas at Austin explained to me via email: “Grenell can continue to serve as Acting DNI for so long as the nomination is pending (however long that is), PLUS 210 days from when it fails, PLUS even more time if a second formal nomination is submitted during that 210-day period. So it’s entirely possible he could end up serving longer than 420 days (or far shorter if the Senate confirms Ratcliffe). What a mess, eh?”
This is worse than a mess. It’s a scandal. Trump still doesn’t know much about the substance of government, but he has figured out how to bend it to his will with the skill of an aspiring autocrat. He has done an end run around the law mandating Senate confirmation of a well-qualified national security professional as head of our intelligence community. Whether he ends up with Ratcliffe or Grenell in charge, Trump can keep a partisan hack in this all-important position all through this critical year even as the Russians attempt to interfere in our election. And everyone is too distracted by other news, from the coronavirus to the stock market, to even notice the corruption of our first line of defense against enemy attack."
"March 4, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-consumer-financial-protection-bureau/2020/03/03/83896dca-5d7b-11ea-b29b-9db42f7803a7_story.html,The Washington Post,Supreme Court considers options in reviewing consumer bureau’s structure,"The Supreme Court has plenty of options if it agrees with the Trump administration that Congress went too far in insulating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from political pressure by forbidding the president to fire its director without cause.
But it was unclear after more than an hour of arguments Tuesday which remedy, if any, might garner the five votes necessary to make a majority.
In general, the liberal justices were protective of the bureau and, by extension, similar independent federal agencies. The conservatives are suspicious of government institutions — as a judge before joining the high court, Brett M. Kavanaugh worried about the “headless fourth branch of government” — and fond of a “unitary executive” approach in which all roads of responsibility lead straight to the president.
If the two sides are unable to agree, Paul Clement, the lawyer appointed by the court to defend the legality of the CFPB since the Trump administration declined to, suggested an out: Decide the case at hand as narrowly as possible and leave the weighty constitutional issues for another day.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed that the question before the court had an “academic quality” to it. Does it intrude on the president’s constitutional authority to direct the executive branch if he is not free to fire the CFPB’s director?
The bureau, the brainchild of now-Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) back when she was still a Harvard University law professor, was part of the 2010 overhaul brought on by the financial crisis. Congress gave it broad powers to implement and enforce consumer protection laws and insulated it even from lawmakers by giving it its own budgetary powers.
It is headed by a single director who is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. But the director can be removed by the president only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,” unlike, say, Cabinet officers who serve at the president’s pleasure.
In that way, the CFPB is similar to other independent federal agencies. Except those agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Reserve Board, have multiple-member boards, rather than a single director.
The CFPB’s structure is “unprecedented and unconstitutional,” said Washington lawyer Kannon K. Shanmugam, who represented a California law firm that refused to comply with a CFPB investigation. “Never before in American history has Congress given so much executive power to a single individual who does not answer to the president.”
The solution he offered the court was to declare the “for cause” protection unlawful and basically shut down the bureau until Congress comes up with a solution.
Liberal justices were skeptical. Justice Sonia Sotomayor reminded that the Social Security Administration had a single director. Ginsburg called the restrictions on the president’s ability “modest,” simply protecting the person — who is supposed to protect consumers — from being removed on the “whim” of the president.
Justice Elena Kagan disagreed with Shanmugam that the difference between lawful and unlawful independent agencies depended on whether they were headed by multiple members or an individual.
“There are a thousand things that go into whether a president has influence over any particular agency, of which the question is it one or multiple members is not so important,” she said.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whose vote is likely to be crucial to the outcome, wondered, like Ginsburg, whether having to show “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office” was such an onerous burden.
“Wouldn’t the normal principles of constitutional avoidance suggest that we might want to scrutinize a little bit how rigorous a limitation that is before we get to the point of striking down the statute?” he asked.
Solicitor General Noel Francisco said the reason the administration was not defending the statute establishing the CFPB was that it infringes on the president’s powers. He said the court could eliminate the “for cause” provision and leave the agency’s powers undisturbed.
He resisted the idea that the removal provision could be watered down to put a more modest restraint on the president.
The president should have the power “to remove a principal officer simply because he has lost faith in their judgment or simply because, even though the current principal officer is perfectly good, he thinks he can do better,” Francisco said.
President Trump’s nominees to the court, Neil M. Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, seemed uninterested in any solution that might dilute a president’s power. As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in a separate case, Kavanaugh already has made the case against the CFPB’s constitutionality. On Tuesday, he noted that the current director will serve until 2023, well into the next presidential term.
Clement, the lawyer appointed by the court, told the justices there could be good reasons for Congress to protect the head of an independent agency, and he gave a real-time example.
“In the current situation, you see people are trying to make a political football out of dealing with a pandemic disease,” Clement said, referring to the debate among lawmakers over how to contain the spread of coronavirus. “So maybe Congress decides: You know what makes sense? Let’s have the head of CDC be protected by for-cause removal. . . . That is the kind of sensible decision that Congress has been making for over 100 years.”
Gorsuch did not seem to appreciate the argument or Clement’s suggestion that the case should be decided in a limited manner without reaching the constitutional issues. He got into a testy and extended exchange about whether Clement, a solicitor general under President George W. Bush who was arguing his 101st case at the court, was avoiding his questions.
“I want to be responsive,” Clement protested.
When Gorsuch asked Clement at one point for a ‘limiting principle” for one of his arguments, Clement replied that he had two, which was two more than offered by the government.
“If we could avoid disparaging our colleagues and just answer my question, I would be grateful,” Gorsuch said with a terse smile."

Now Beijing can teach the Federal Reserve a thing or two about how to contain its financial destruction.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may have thought he was ahead of the curve by cutting rates 50 basis points before the central bank’s scheduled March meeting. Yet traders were unimpressed by Powell’s reluctance to go further, which sent the S&P 500 Index 2.8% lower Tuesday. The Chinese yuan strengthened 0.68% against the U.S. dollar in Asian trading, the most this year.
They have a point. The headlines may sound nice, but questions remain about whether this transmission mechanism works, especially for smaller businesses.
In China, this is the sector most affected by the outbreak. For one, these companies don’t have much sway over the supply chain, even for items as simple as face masks and hand sanitizer. Large corporations such as Apple Inc. supplier Foxconn Technology Co. have started their own mask assembly lines just to meet its workers’ needs. That option simply isn’t available if you are sub-scale. And while bigger companies are largely back in operation, two-thirds of smaller ones still couldn’t get their employees to work as of last week, according to Beijing’s own government briefing.
The situation could be even more dire in the U.S., where small and medium-size businesses are less profitable and more indebted.
In its latest global financial-stability assessment, the International Monetary Fund found that while Chinese SMEs remain highly profitable — and large, state-owned enterprises are economic drags — the situation is just the opposite in the U.S. American SMEs are in the worst financial shape among countries in the survey, which looked at more than 1.3 million companies across major global economies. Over 60% of SME corporate debt is issued by borrowers that don’t make enough profit to cover their annual interest payments. In times of distress, it’s unclear that banks and the private-loan market will allow smaller businesses to refinance.
Welcome to China, where bureaucrats are now forcing their banks to extend loans to SMEs. In addition to cutting the new benchmark rate, the People’s Bank of China has set up a re-lending facility aimed at smaller businesses, dictating that banks must not issue loans above 4.55%, a very generous level considering the loan prime rate — that is, the rate banks offer to their best corporate clients — is 4.05%.
Meanwhile, to get the financial plumbing going, Beijing is tweaking all sorts of rules, making it easier for companies to issue bonds and raise funds via equity follow-on offerings. To prop up its credit markets, banks’ wealth-management units no longer require first-time retail investors to go into local branches for in-person risk assessments. You can just open accounts online and start buying. In February, mutual funds and ETFs raised over 100 billion yuan ($14.4 billion), the most since June, 2018, which has helped China’s stock market stage a V-shaped rebound. 
I’m not saying that China is doing everything right, and many of its emergency policies could become additional risks to financial stability. But you’ve got to give Beijing credit for being creative and throwing the kitchen sink at the virus. The Fed, meanwhile, comes across as ambiguous and hesitant. At the press conference following the announcement, Powell described the current policy stance as “appropriate,” and that future changes depend on “the flow of events” and “a range of things.”
Last September, when the Fed somehow botched a critical market rescue operation — its first overnight repurchase agreement operation in a decade — traders in China were perplexed. Open market operations have become commonplace in the mainland, and the central bank is designing sophisticated, new tools to help its banks shore up capital and guide them to targeted lending.
Blanket interest cuts won’t kill the virus and are only likely to benefit the rich and powerful. That’s probably why Bernie Sanders’s populist message is resonating with small business owners in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The Fed needs to get creative and more targeted in its market rescue."

The Incas worshipped it. Shiny flakes of it set off a 19th-century rush to California and families in India use it to store wealth on the arms of their daughters. Gold’s allure remains as untarnished as the noble metal itself. But its price is subject to manias and periods of ambivalence. Since the turn of the millennium, gold has seen a seven-fold rally, a 45% crash and sustained periods where its price moved very little. The drivers of sentiment change over time, and understanding how they shift can be as revealing about the collective psyche of global investors as it is about the nature of bullion itself. Just what is it that keeps investors coming back to gold?
The Situation
Bullion’s time-honored appeal as a haven from unexpected events is demonstrated again and again: It surged to a seven-year high as the coronavirus began to sweep the globe in early 2020, and briefly spiked after Donald Trump’s upset victory in the U.S. presidential election in 2016. In between there were two years of steady prices, with every rally capped as gold approached $1,350 an ounce. That began to change in 2019, when slowing global economic growth, worries over tensions in the Middle East and a trade war between the world’s biggest economies dented the belief that riskier assets would continue climbing. Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds hit a record, hedge funds bet on higher prices and central banks piled in. In February 2020, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that gold was acting as a haven of last resort, and predicted that the price could top $1,800 an ounce within months if the virus outbreak worsens. With interest rates and bond yields at historic lows, the opportunity cost of owning gold has largely evaporated.
The Background
Discarded as a monetary system when its peg to the dollar ended in the 1970s, gold spiked to $850 in 1980 on a bout of inflation. Prices slumped in the following two decades as central banks around the world shrank their reserves and miners locked in prices for future production. The launch of the first gold ETF in 2003, which made it possible for retail and equity-market investors to directly access the metal via their stockbrokers, set off a wave of gold buying that lifted prices for almost a decade. Then the 2008 financial crisis sent prices steadily up to a record high in 2011 as money was parked in havens on fear that bond-buying by central banks would lead to hyperinflation. Even so, some investors never warmed to gold. Legendary business guru Warren Buffett expressed his disdain for the metal because it has no inherent yield and isn’t productive like, say, companies or farmland. He wrote in 2012 that investors in gold are motivated by their “belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow.”
The Argument
More than perhaps any other investment, bullion acts as an echo chamber for anxieties about the global financial system and the ability of central bankers to keep economic growth going. Gold bears say it is a relic of history and that there are better ways of hedging against uncertainty, including financial instruments such as derivatives. Bulls say it offers them a simpler way to protect against a wider range of risks. Demand for gold is supported by rising incomes in China, India and other Asian countries, where families often buy it for dowries and there are fewer safe stores of wealth. In the West, some fans of gold, known as “gold bugs,” believe it should be restored to its place as the guarantor of government-issued currencies. Even one of Trump’s nominees for the Federal Reserve was historically an advocate of returning to the gold standard. But ultimately, gold’s reputation for withstanding the effects of inflation — at the cost of sacrificing yield — comes into its own when interest rates on bonds drop below the rate of general price increases. Compared with the trillions of dollars’ worth of bonds around the world now delivering negative returns, gold is shining once again.

Shares in the emerging markets lender rose on Tuesday after Bloomberg News reported that Chairman Jose Vinals has informally approached banking executives to gauge interest in replacing Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters, who’s about to complete five years at the Asia-focused bank. StanChart responded to the story by saying it would like to retain Winters for “as long as possible” and described the meetings with outside candidates as normal succession planning. 
Investors have plenty of reasons to want a new boss. Winters picked a churlish fight with some of them last year over his pay, calling them “immature,” even when his steering of the bank didn’t exactly justify the compensation. StanChart recently delayed its target of a 10% return on tangible equity to beyond 2021 after delivering just 6.4% last year, 2 percentage points lower than larger rival HSBC Holdings Plc.
Still, viewed from coronavirus-hit Hong Kong — StanChart’s biggest market — you’d have to ask whether 2020 is really the right year for making big changes at the top. This isn’t 2015, when Winters was brought in to deal with a big bad loan problem. Now banks are grappling with low interest rates and the impact of the virus. A steady ship is critical.
StanChart’s main task this year will be to lift profitability through stricter cost controls. Maybe a new CEO could cut thousands of jobs, as HSBC’s interim boss Noel Quinn is doing. But a similar axing of headcount might look like overkill if the outbreak doesn’t last much longer. The bank is midway through the launch of an internet bank to attract millennial and Generation Z savers in Hong Kong, where its customers are getting old. Why jeopardize that?
True, StanChart’s $500 million buyback was less than investors expected last week, but the sale of Indonesia’s PT Bank Permata should release the capital needed to return some more to investors.
Besides, where exactly is Vinals going to find this new CEO? Europe’s biggest banks are already struggling to fill their own posts, and there’s hardly a surfeit of talent out there. Neither are decent executives falling over themselves to work for bigger lenders; look at Jean Pierre Mustier’s snub of HSBC in favor of staying with Italy’s UniCredit SpA.
If Vinals could land someone like Piyush Gupta, CEO of Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd., then investors would have cause to celebrate. The head of Singapore’s largest bank has won accolades for digitizing the lender, a holy grail for the finance industry. But would Gupta really consider the job unless Singapore’s state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte. — the largest shareholder of both StanChart and DBS — saw value in combining the two banks? Such a merger, as far as we know, isn’t on the cards.  
A mediocre StanChart may frustrate investors; an unstable one would hurt them even more. "
"March 4, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/03/facebook-pharma-ads/,The Washington Post,Facebook has a prescription: More pharmaceutical ads,"Jordan Lemasters keeps seeing ads in his Facebook app for an attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drug called Vyvanse. When the Chicago-based audio branding consultant recently clicked on the ad’s drop-down menu and selected “Why Am I Seeing This Ad,” a pop-up said it was because of his age range, because he lives in the United States and because he may have visited Vyvanse.com.
But Lemasters felt spooked. The 29-year-old had used another ADHD drug, Adderall, but never publicized it. The ads “just felt invasive,” says Lemasters, who says he quit Adderall in 2017 because it made him feel like a zombie. “What bothers me is how powerful those drugs are and how it’s pushed, rather than a doctor actually assessing a patient and suggesting a proper solution.”
After years of avoiding social media, drug companies are growing bolder about advertising on Facebook and other social networks, according to interviews with advertising executives, marketers, health-care privacy researchers and patient advocates. That is exposing loopholes around the way data can be used to show consumers relevant ads about their personal health, even as both social networks and pharmaceutical manufacturers disavow targeting ads to people based on their medical conditions.
Ads promoting prescription drugs are popping up on Facebook for depression, HIV and cancer. Spending on Facebook mobile ads alone by pharmaceutical and health-care brands reached nearly a billion dollars in 2019, nearly tripling over two years, according to Pathmatics, an advertising analytics company. Facebook offers tools to help drug companies stay compliant with rules about disclosing safety information or reporting side effects.
But seeing an ad for a drug designed to treat a person’s particular health condition in the relatively intimate setting of a social media feed — amid pictures of friends and links to news articles — can feel more intrusive than elsewhere online. The same opaque Facebook systems that help place an ad for a political campaign or a new shoe in a user’s feed also can be used by pharmaceutical companies, allowing them to target consumers who match certain characteristics or had visited a particular website in the past.
The ability of drug companies to reach people likely to have specific health conditions — a far cry from a magazine or TV ad — underscores how the nation’s health privacy law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), has not kept up with the times. HIPAA, which safeguards personal health records, typically does not cover drug companies or social media networks.
It also typically doesn’t cover the sea of companies known as data brokers that can collect medical information like prescriptions, insurance claims and even electronic health records — as long as they detach the data from the full name and address of the patient — among other personal details. Those data brokers first sort the information into groups that are useful for advertisers. Then brokers match that data with identifiers such as email addresses, Zip codes and phone numbers.
Facebook says membership or activity in a group is not used to target ads, and the company’s policies prohibit using medical history for targeting, too.
“Medical history is not used to inform the interest categories that we make available to advertisers, and we prohibit businesses from sending us sensitive health information,” Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne said in a statement. “Our teams work with health related companies looking to reach their audiences on Facebook and we require them to act in accordance with the law.”
Targeting is ubiquitous when it comes to advertising a bathing suit or dish soap on social media. But some patient advocates worry applying standard ad-targeting techniques to health data could cause embarrassment in front of friends and family or discrimination by employers, potentially even affecting insurance rates or service offerings.
“Knowledge about us shouldn’t be used to target us, to limit our choices, or manipulate our human vulnerabilities,” said Andrea Downing, who moderates a Facebook group for women who have a gene that raises the odds of breast cancer. She filed a 2018 complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about Facebook’s privacy practices.
The growing concern about targeted pharmaceutical ads is unfolding against an expansion at Facebook focusing more generally on health — including encouraging more groups, where community members gather to discuss certain topics, like the one Downing moderates. It’s also been actively soliciting more health-care-focused ads. Underscoring the important role Facebook plays in health information, the company has recently policed disinformation around the coronavirus.
To reach potential consumers, drug companies don’t need to know an individual’s medical history. In many cases, the companies don’t want the data, since it comes with increased liability of violating new privacy laws such as those in Europe and California or angering regulators.
Health-care researchers say geographic data could be used to target communities with a high percentage of people with substance abuse disorders. Or data such as the size of pants bought online, the type of food purchased with a supermarket loyalty card and a cable TV subscription could be combined to target a potentially obese group of consumers, said Adam Tanner, author of “Our Bodies, Our Data: How Companies Make Billions Selling Our Medical Records.”
Data brokers match data acquired from hospitals, pharmacies and elsewhere with emails, phone numbers, IP addresses and advertising identification numbers to provide a customized list of people who have the characteristics that advertisers want to target. Advertising identifiers are a string of numbers assigned to iPhone or Android devices or to Facebook users that help advertisers pinpoint consumers without knowing who they are.
Advertisers can then upload those custom lists and match identifiers with social media users. Using Facebook’s tools, advertisers can also create a “look-alike audience” that shares those same attributes.
In addition to using custom lists, Facebook’s ad tools allow advertisers to target based on user behavior (such as “likely to engage with conservative U.S. political content”), demographics (such as household income) and interests (such as “motherhood” or “parenting”). Facebook says interest categories are informed by only three actions: whether a user has liked or interacted with a Facebook page or clicked on an ad. A user’s search history within the platform or on the wider Web are not used to inform interest categories, the company says.
Facebook began to remove some health-related interest categories that seemed to be proxies for having a particular disease in 2017, after backlash about discriminatory advertising on Facebook. But the company still permits health interest labels that promote disease awareness or support. There are interest groups around ADHD and depression. Some breast cancer interest groups encompass tens of millions of Facebook users.
Even if the drug companies aren’t using personal data to target an ad, “the effect is the same from the user’s perspective,” said Kirsten Ostherr, a digital health technology researcher at Rice University.
Takeda Pharmaceuticals, which paid for the Vyvanse ads seen by Lemasters and which also owns Adderall, does not have access to information about an individual’s past or present prescriptions “to be used in that way,” said Kara M. Hoeger, director of corporate communications for neuroscience.
“Takeda is strongly committed to protecting individuals’ privacy and rights with regard to their personal data,” Hoeger said in a statement. “Notably, it is not possible and we do not engage an individual on any social media platform based on what treatments they are prescribed.”
Takeda did not respond to questions about how the ads were targeted. But when someone visits a Vyvanse Web page featured in a Facebook ad, they are tracked by a variety of tools, including cookies and fingerprinting technology, which profiles your online behavior, according to a feature on Firefox browsers that helps users see how their online activity is being tracked.
Pharma advertising has been around for a while on Google and its video-streaming service YouTube, which allow prescription ads to target based on content. They prohibit drug companies from using personalized targeting, such as demographic information, customized audiences or interest-based targeting. Even so, ad agencies say Facebook is still the leading choice for health advertisers, in part because many users are already discussing their health there.
Pfizer, Allergan, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline were among the top 10 spenders on Facebook mobile ads in 2019, along with fast-growing health start-ups such as SmileDirectClub and Roman, according to Pathmatics.
Pharmaceutical companies say they only target based on nonsensitive data. Ryan McKeel, a spokesperson for Gilead Sciences, which is running Facebook ads for the HIV drugs Descovy and Biktarvy, told The Washington Post: “The intended audiences for these campaigns are based on epidemiologic data. Outreach is a result of commonly available, aggregate demographic data (age, gender, geography), self-reported information and user interests.”
There are potential benefits to this kind of advertising, said Eric Perakslis, former chief information officer and chief scientist of informatics at the Food and Drug Administration. Pharma companies can reach people most in need of their product, and the social aspect of advertising could even help with adherence to taking medication.
Social media has also been an effective tool for recruiting patients for clinical trials and for getting ads in front of health-care professionals most likely to prescribe a drug, according to Kate Endres, vice president of health and beauty at Havas Media Group, who works with pharmaceutical clients.
Current pharma ad campaigns on Facebook and Instagram promote prescription drugs for treatment of major depressive episodes, weight loss for overweight and obese people, HIV prevention and treatment, and cancer immunotherapy, as well as a multiple sclerosis medication marketed to millennials. Those “branded” ads promote the name of the drug and warn about potential risks, just like on TV.
Even more common are sponsored posts from celebrity influencers and patient influencers. For example, Audrina Patridge, a reality TV star from MTV’s show “The Hills,” recently promoted lip injections by Juvéderm to her 1.7 million Instagram followers. There are also “unbranded” disease awareness campaigns that don’t name the drug.
Unbranded advertising offers another workaround to regulatory concerns. AMAG Pharmaceuticals reached 25 million women on Facebook and Instagram for a disease awareness campaign called Unblush for hypoactive sexual desire disorder, said Meghan Rivera, AMAG’s head of women’s health sales and marketing. It was launched months before AMAG’s “female Viagra,” a prescription injection taken 45 minutes before intercourse, was approved by the FDA. The campaign targeted users only by age, gender and people who visited their unbranded websites, she said.
Rivera said social media was an obvious fit because using real women to speak authentically about their experience helped destigmatize the conversation around sexual health. “This is where women are going and engaging not only in conversations, but also as an exploratory space. If you’re posting something relevant to them, we see significant interaction,” she said.
Direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising is regulated by the FDA, which published “draft guidance” in 2014 around social media drug ads that did not include any restrictions on ad targeting.
When Facebook started actively soliciting pharmaceutical ads in late 2016, the initial pitch fizzled out in part because pharma companies found the standard behavioral advertising tactics — such as using cookies to target consumers based on which websites they visited — too risky, said Ritesh Patel, chief digital officer of health at Ogilvy Consulting, a division of the global ad agency, which works with large pharma clients.
Even now, Patel said, “all of my clients are absolutely very particular about making sure that any program that we do, whether it’s digital or social, there’s no ability to get access to personally identifiable information.”
Facebook has made a renewed push to attract pharma ads over the past couple of years, said Endres, from Havas Media Group. She estimates that there are at least 30 people inside Facebook working with health and pharma clients and says Facebook’s legal team has jumped on a call when one of her pharma clients had questions.
Health advocates say the ability to target patients in an otherwise highly regulated space underscores the broader lack of accountability in how consumer health data is shared and used to influence behavior.
“There’s widespread acknowledgment that HIPAA needs to be updated for the 21st century,” said Ostherr, the Rice digital health technology researcher. “We should be demanding that policymakers really think about not just the Facebooks of the world, even though they’re important, but the larger economy of data mining and digital profiling that is totally invisible to the average user, but also the average doctor.”
In late January, the FDA proposed a set of studies that will use a real Instagram influencer to promote a fictitious prescription medication for endometriosis to examine influencer marketing, including how “focusing on target populations” impacts consumer awareness of risks and intent to purchase the drug.
In a statement, FDA spokesperson Brittney Manchester said, “The FDA actively continues to consider these and other social media topics, and more broadly works to develop approaches to a variety of topics related to the labeling and advertising of medical products.” The FDA requires promotion of medical products on the Internet and social media to be “truthful, non-misleading and balanced.”
The Federal Trade Commission, which oversees deceptive advertising, also has regulatory oversight. The FTC says companies that “use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as health information, for or through targeted advertising . . . could be subject to an FTC enforcement action” for deception or unfairness.
Industry trade groups who want to keep these practices self-regulated have stepped in to offer guidance. In January, the Network Advertising Initiative, an association for third-party digital advertising companies, published a code of conduct on “health-related tailored advertising.” It covered consent from consumers, the use of offline data, and “inferences that a user has, or is likely to have sensitive health conditions.”
The NAI’s head of compliance, Anthony Matyjaszewski, said, “We didn’t want companies to take advantage, under the guise of demographic marketing, to get really very specific about who they’re trying to target.”"

Treasuries extended their rally after the Federal Reserve’s emergency rate cut on Tuesday sent 10-year yields below 1% for the first time. Bond yields tumbled to record lows from London to Sydney, reflecting a volatile mix of fear over the coronavirus fallout and rush for higher returns after Treasuries entered uncharted territory.
Fed’s Emergency Rate Cut Drags Global Yields to All-Time Lows
“The Fed rate cut validates the current rate environment and supports buying and holding high-quality duration,” Bob Michele, global head of fixed income at the asset manager, said in an email. “This should lead to an acceleration of flows into the U.S. bond market from negative-yielding bond markets as the cost of hedging to euro or yen has been diminished.”
The Fed’s half-point cut on Tuesday was the first such emergency move since the 2008 financial crisis, taken amid concerns about the global economic fallout from the virus outbreak.
JPMorgan Asset is also watching to see how credit may be extended to small and medium-sized businesses that may face cash shortfalls as business declines.
“The Fed rate cut paves the way for the Small Business Administration to extend credit at a lower cost to needy borrowers,” Michele said. “We expect the capacity of the SBA to be increased if the infection rate in the U.S. accelerates.”"

Reacting to news that Sessions had fallen well short of a majority in Tuesday’s Alabama Republican primary, Trump unloaded on the man he blamed for the two-year federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race — suggesting he would take a more active role ahead of a decisive March 31 GOP runoff after remaining on the sidelines for months.
“This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt,” Trump wrote, referring to the probe led by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. “Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!”
The other candidate who qualified for the runoff — former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, who has portrayed himself as a Trumpian outsider who would be completely loyal to the president — immediately endorsed the tweet: “Mr. President, I could not agree more, and in 27 days help will be on the way!”
Trump’s signal to Alabama voters came less than 12 hours after polls closed in key congressional races that offered a grab bag of implications for each party and their quests for control of Congress.
Also on Wednesday morning, a key Democratic race was decided when Jessica Cisneros, a 26-year-old civil rights attorney, conceded her campaign to unseat Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who is among the most conservative Democrats in the House. Cisneros had run on a platform that included support for a single-payer health care system, the Green New Deal climate plan, a $15 minimum wage and other liberal priorities.
The race has been closely watched on Capitol Hill as a gauge of whether Democratic voters would be willing to vote out more moderate incumbents — including several House committee chairmen who are facing challenges later this year. Cisneros attracted support from, among others, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Cisneros had hoped to replicate Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 success in ousting an entrenched incumbent.
But Cuellar — with the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and traditionally Republican allies such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the conservative funding network led by industrialist Charles Koch — eked out a four-point win in his border district.
Cisneros, with help from multiple unions and the powerful Democratic group Emily’s List, won by a large margin in the suburbs of San Antonio but could not overcome Cuellar’s strength in the Rio Grande Valley, including his hometown of Laredo. But in remarks conceding the race Wednesday, she said the close result showed her campaign had “exceeded all expectations” and suggested she might run again in two years — when lower midterm turnout could work to her advantage.
“We’ve built an incredibly strong organizing operation,” she told reporters in Laredo. “This fight was an opportunity to prove that a brown girl from the border with her whole community behind her could take on the machine and bring hope to South Texas, and we accomplished that, and we are going to keep fighting.”
To other Democrats, however, Cuellar’s win showed there is a limit in many districts for hard-left policies — and that internecine battles are a waste of resources better spent on the general election. Another such contest looms on March 17, when antiabortion Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.) faces a second consecutive challenge from activist Marie Newman.
“Monumental waste of resources that could have been used to keep more blue seats — and gain some, if we could,” said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Tex.), who represents a neighboring district to Cuellar’s.
Another House incumbent, Rep. Kay Granger (R-Tex.), won a considerably more comfortable victory in her primary battle against a conservative insurgent, Chris Putnam, who attacked her role as a top appropriator in negotiating and passing government spending bills that have compounded the national debt.
But the message never took hold, especially after Trump endorsed Granger. On Wednesday, following her nearly 16-point win, Granger was on the House floor advocating for a bipartisan $8.6 billion spending bill targeting the coronavirus outbreak.
The effect of Trump’s endorsement was felt across the congressional map Tuesday, though it was not entirely a magic wand. Three Trump-endorsed Republicans — Wesley Hunt in Texas’s 7th District, August Pfluger in Texas’s 11th District and Beth Van Duyne in Texas’s 24th District — easily won nomination in crowded fields, and Jay Obernolte advanced to November in California’s 8th District.
But Ronny L. Jackson, the former White House attending physician who was briefly Trump’s nominee as secretary of Veterans Affairs, finished in a distant second place in Texas’s 13th district and now faces a runoff.
Trump made no endorsement in another notable race that reflected the Trumpian tilt of the GOP: Pierce Bush, a scion of the famous GOP family that has clashed with Trump, finished a distant third in a House bid in the Houston suburbs.
But Trump is likely to cast a large shadow in the coming month in Alabama, where Sessions promised Wednesday to campaign “with great confidence,” casting Tuberville as an untested outsider who moved back into the state just to enter politics.
“Let me say this — no one will prevail in this Senate race without being vetted. This is especially true of a tourist from Florida,” Sessions tweeted Tuesday. “The preliminaries are over. Now, we must know where our opponent stands on the key issues, like immigration and trade. One thing is clear. There is no doubt where I stand on these issues. You have trusted me before, and you can absolutely trust me again.”
Tuberville, who held a two-point lead in unofficial returns, cast Sessions as a “swamp insider” in a fundraising pitch sent Wednesday — suggesting a nasty campaign ahead.
Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), who has remained neutral in the race, said Tuberville’s plurality “showed the power of the president” in holding down support for a politician who was easily reelected three times after first winning election in 1996.
“He’s a good man, but you have to win it on the battlefield,” Shelby said Wednesday of Sessions. “He’s got a shot at it. But it’s a runoff, it’ll be a smaller turnout. . . . He’s got a deep challenge.”
In other notable results Wednesday, three former members of the House kept their hopes of returning to Congress alive: David Valadao is set for a rematch with Rep. TJ Cox (D-Calif.). In Texas, Pete Sessions (R) lost a Dallas-area seat in 2018, moved to a more conservative Waco-based district last year and now faces a runoff for the nomination, while Darrell Issa (R), who retired ahead of the 2018 election, appeared poised to advance to the November general election in a California primary that might not be decided for days due to the counting of mailed ballots."

The owner of the Lakeside and Trafford Centre shopping malls said on Wednesday that it had been unable to raise between 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) and 1.5 billion pounds of equity.
That’s not surprising. Even before the outbreak of the new coronavirus, tapping shareholders looked like a long shot. Intu has 4.5 billion pounds of net debt, representing a whopping 68% of the market value of its properties. Despite the value of its estate plunging by 2 billion pounds, more pain on high streets and in malls looks likely. As my colleague Chris Bryant has argued, Intu left it far too late to raise equity.
The failure leaves the company in a bind. Some of its borrowings are at a corporate level, but others are against individual properties. It has almost 1 billion pounds falling due in 2021. Intu can pay the interest on its debts, but covenants look tight. Intu said it was still within its borrowing limits right now, but there was a risk that it could breach covenants at its next test in July.
Susan Munden, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, estimates that a 10% fall in the value of its properties and rental income would require another 300 million pounds of liquidity. And that’s before any impact on Intu’s tenants from the Covid-19 scare. As I have noted, there is already anecdotal evidence that footfall has been hit by worries about contracting the disease in shops and malls. So far Intu said that it had not seen a meaningful drop.
Options for securing this funding are limited.
Intu could look to sell more assets. It has already offloaded its interest in two Spanish sites and part of a mall in Derby. It still owns 100% of the Trafford and Lakeside centers, so it could bring in partners there too.  
But given the scale of the crisis, some form of debt-for-equity swap looks inevitable. The shares, which have fallen more than 90% over the past year, traded at less than 10 pence on Wednesday. At this level, they are pricing in expectations that there’s a chance of the equity being wiped out. That’s a boon for short sellers, including Crispin Odey, but a worry for long-suffering shareholders, as well as bondholders who would likely take a haircut in a radical restructuring.
For all its woes, Intu has some decent assets. Some malls have adjoining land, which could be used for residential development.
One wild card could be Mike Ashley, majority owner of Frasers Group Plc, formerly Sports Direct. He is no stranger to a bargain, and will have many stores in Intu malls. Frasers shareholders likely wouldn’t welcome his intervention, especially after his debacle at Debenhams. But Intu investors and bondholders might. The property company certainly needs a solution and fast."
"March 5, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/05/super-tuesday-miracle-i-hoped-has-occurred/,The Washington Post,"Thank you, Democrats, for acting to save our democracy on Super Tuesday","In 2016, the Republican Party had a mental and moral breakdown that has done lasting damage to the country. A bigoted and boorish reality-TV star came out of nowhere to win the primaries as more mainstream contenders bickered among themselves. Donald Trump surprised everyone by winning the general election, but the results of his unexpected presidency have been as dismal as feared: He is incompetent at everything other than undermining democratic norms.
In politics, as in physics, when the weight in a pendulum is raised far to one side, it will swing back far to the other side. So I have been terrified that the Democratic Party would react to the Republicans’ shift toward far-right populism by shifting toward far-left populism. My worst fears appeared to be coming true after Bernie Sanders’s strong showings in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. On Feb. 24, I wrote that “barring a Super Tuesday miracle, there is little hope for anything but a Sanders vs. Trump election in which there is no good outcome.” Now that miracle has occurred.
The political world had written off Joe Biden after a fourth-place finish in Iowa and a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire. “Joe Biden is down for the count,” I wrote on Feb. 12. Now he has gotten up off the canvas and delivered a body blow to the Sanders campaign. Biden won 10 of 14 states on Tuesday to take a lead in the overall delegate count. Never has there been more dramatic confirmation of the old adage — attributed to former British prime minister Harold Wilson — that “a week is a long time in politics.”
Much of the political commentary since this dramatic turnaround has focused on factors such as Rep. James E. Clyburn’s (D-S.C.) crucial endorsement, which enabled Biden’s huge victory in South Carolina on Saturday. Also cited have been the roles of Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar in cutting down Biden’s moderate rivals, Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, in the debates. Biden was also helped greatly by his bond with African American voters — he won 58 percent of the black vote on Super Tuesday — and by the farsighted decision of Buttigieg and Klobuchar to exit the race and endorse him.
Opinion
Who could win the Democratic primary?
Use the Post Opinions Simulator to pick a state and see what might happen in upcoming primaries and caucuses.
I suspect another factor at play as well. I believe that Biden was helped by the outbreak of the coronavirus and the resulting stock market correction. In a time of chaos and fear, a lot of Democratic voters might have been less willing to gamble on a radical ideologue such as Sanders. These are times that call for reassurance, not revolution, and that is what the Democrats will get if they nominate the avuncular Uncle Joe.
Something similar occurred in 2004 (when Democrats flirted with Howard Dean and John Edwards before nominating John Kerry) and in 2008 (when Republicans flirted with Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mike Huckabee before nominating John McCain). Centrists such as Kerry, McCain and Biden might not be very exciting, but they are safe and dependable — and in the current environment of radical uncertainty, that counts for a lot. The failure of either McCain or Kerry to become president reminds us that these old Washington warhorses are no surefire winners, but in the current field, it’s hard to see anyone else who would have a better chance than Biden.
The contrast between Sanders and Biden could be seen in their Tuesday night speeches. Sanders was full of hate for the “corporate establishment” and the “political establishment,” for drug companies and Wall Street, and for his chief rival, even if he didn’t attack Biden by name. This is typical of a candidate who, like Trump, has sought to mobilize his base rather than to expand it.
Biden, by contrast, has sought to appeal to all factions of the Democratic Party and to all Americans who are disaffected by Trump. His Super Tuesday night speech was full of “hope” — literally. Paraphrasing Irish poet Seamus Heaney, he said, “We can make hope and history rhyme because of what we sing.” That is the kind of inclusive message employed by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the last two Democrats to win the White House.
Biden has been pilloried by the Sanderistas for wanting to work with Republicans, but that is exactly the right message to win over the disaffected moderates, including many Never Trump Republicans, who gave Democrats control of the House in 2018. Just as Obama kept Robert Gates as defense secretary, Biden would be well advised to promise that he will appoint a Republican to one of his senior Cabinet positions.
The campaign is far from over. Sanders could still stage a comeback and, even if he doesn’t, Biden will face the race of his life against a dishonest incumbent who will stop at nothing to win. Trump is already suggesting that “Sleepy Joe” is senile and that “Crazy Bernie” is the victim of an establishment plot. But for the first time since Nov. 8, 2016, I have some hope for the future of our democracy. Thank you, Democrats, for acting sensibly and sanely to save our country from the consequences of the Republicans’ colossal irresponsibility."
"March 6, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/bankers-are-staring-into-the-abyss-again/2020/03/05/1e834e80-5eb8-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html,The Washington Post,"Bankers Are Staring Into the Abyss, Again","Europe’s lenders are staring at yet another possible crisis, this time not of their own making, and the brutal reality is that the European Central Bank can do very little to help them. That’s bad news for the real economy too.
The economic hit from the rapid spread of the coronavirus will probably mean another spate of loans turning bad, a slump in demand for new borrowing, and falling income from trading and commission. The banking industry has been among the hardest hit in the recent stock-market rout. Little wonder.
There are some minor measures that ECB President Christine Lagarde could try to mitigate the pain, especially if she decides to cut the benchmark deposit rate deeper into negative territory (a nightmare for banks trying to squeeze a profit from lending). 
At the very least, the ECB should protect lenders from any increased cost of depositing their excess reserves at the central bank by sweetening the terms of the “tiering” regime that it adopted in September. That change lifted about 800 billion euros ($892 billion) of commercial bank reserves at the ECB out of the -0.50% deposit rate tier — where banks are paying for the privilege of storing their money — and toward a slightly less punishing zero rate.
Separately, the ECB is already considering whether to offer banks even more super-cheap loans — known as targeted long-term repurchase operations, or TLTROs. This is wise. It will be vital for maintaining the liquidity of cash-strapped corporates; about three-quarters of European company borrowing comes via bank loans.
But there are justified doubts about the effectiveness of TLTROs in getting money to the neediest firms. In the fourth quarter of last year, companies’ demand for loans dropped in the euro zone. Even more laser-focused funding is needed specifically for small and medium-sized companies to prevent a credit crunch in the backbone of the region’s economy —  with even more attractive rates to encourage banks to participate. TLTROs are no magic wand if there’s no demand and banks are hesitant to lend.
A more controversial measure would be to adapt the ECB’s 190 billion-euro ($211 billion) corporate bond-buying program to allow the purchase of bank debt too. That might lower banks’ funding costs, which have risen since the virus hit Europe. 
Unfortunately, there are huge conflicts of interest in directly financing banks, which are regulated by the ECB. Germany would certainly balk. Last decade’s euro crisis was exacerbated by the doom loop, where certain banks held too many of their nation’s bonds — intensifying the riskiness of the sovereign debt and the country’s banking system. A move that established new ties between a supranational authority and large lenders would bring its own fears.
In the wake of the virus outbreak, the Italian lenders’ association is already pleading for forbearance to allow the nation’s banks not to record past bad loans. But the ECB should stand firm. Such a move might help shield the lenders’ profit and capital in the short term but it would undermine confidence in an industry that’s still trying to win back investor trust. It never works to let banks sweep bad debt under the carpet.
European lenders are only recently emerging from a post-crisis cleanup that took years, getting bad debt levels back to more manageable levels (they’ve dropped by almost half to 543 billion euros). Banks have also steadily built capital buffers. Regulators could let them eat into these ratios, but such hard-fought improvements mustn’t be reversed lightly.
The continent’s banks were already in for an unhappy time before the virus hit, given the euro-area economy’s struggles. Now the industrial heartland of Italy has ground to a halt, the bloc’s frailties will be more exposed. A Europe Commission briefing note, seen by Bloomberg News, has warned that the virus could plunge Italy and France into recession. The paper spoke specifically of a possible increase in bad loans “to leveraged companies operating on a tight cash flow” and a decline in the bank asset values that “may trigger a vicious sovereign-bank loop.” 
There’s no easy fix and the ECB has limited ammunition. The most dangerous temptation will be to unwind the progress made on improving banks’ resilience."

Beijing has spent its way out of distress before, and may just reach for a trillion-dollar fiscal stimulus again. 
Investors understandably got excited after media reports that seven out of 31 provincial-level governments have pledged to spend a combined 24.5 trillion yuan — with 3.5 trillion yuan ($505 billion) slated for this year — on infrastructure projects. The final amount will certainly be much higher, as other municipals join the fray. 
Hope for a big-ticket fiscal package isn’t unfounded. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., China spent 4 trillion yuan building roads, bridges and railways, successfully pulling itself out of a slump. And there are tantalizing signs that China will deliver: To grease local governments’ access to financing, Beijing has allowed its underlings to issue special-purpose bonds early, to the tune of over 1.8 trillion yuan.
This optimism, coupled with monetary easing, has helped China’s stock market stage a V-shaped rebound. Infrastructure stocks tracked by the CSI 300 Index are up 12% from a low in early February.
But don’t get carried away. These flashy headline figures come from fawning local-government officials, eager to deliver growth targets to Beijing. What gets done is a different matter.
Some projects are clearly just blueprints awaiting a final nod. For instance, Yunnan province, the most aggressive of the bunch, is planning a high-speed railway linking its capital Kunming to the resort town of Lijiang. Beijing may balk at the cost, estimated at 100 billion yuan, or about 5% of the province’s gross domestic product, says Nomura Securities Co. 
Then there’s the fact that Yunnan’s books are in poor order. Over the years, it has had to save some of its local-government financing vehicles from the brink of bankruptcy. In early 2018, it injected 2 billion yuan of capital into a vehicle that defaulted on two trust loans. Last year, two others saw their offshore dollar bonds tumble: One entity is embroiled in a legal battle with a now-defunct energy trader, and the other had its chairman placed under investigation. Both bleed cash.
Speaking of finances, how will local governments pay for these billion-dollar projects? Last year, their general revenue rose by only 3.2%, the lowest in a decade, and well below their full-year target of 4.9%, according to Moody’s Investors Service. A big tax cut in 2019 and an economic slowdown has emptied municipals’ wallets.
China’s infrastructure investment has also been stalling, rising just 3.1% last year. For building projects to re-accelerate, local governments will need the help of banking regulators.
For now, municipals are relying on the bond market, avidly issuing special-purpose bonds that get gobbled up by obliging state-owned banks. That’s not enough. China’s annual infrastructure spending is about 17 trillion yuan, far exceeding the roughly 3 trillion yuan of bonds local governments can issue.
A lot of this comes back to Beijing’s crackdown on shadow banking, which began in late 2017. For the past five years, China has been relying on public-private partnerships to build roads and railways. Yet private money essentially fled after new rules forbade wealth management products, typically short-term, to invest in longer-term projects, a.k.a. infrastructure.
In other words, talk of fiscal stimulus is meaningless unless China’s banking regulator relents.
It’s entirely possible that China is going to launch another massive fiscal package and any bet on infrastructure will pay off handsomely. But keep a close eye on sources of information. If the Ministry of Finance officially raises its fiscal deficit above 3% — an international gold standard, which Beijing has been careful not to cross — three cheers. Or if the People’s Bank of China reopens lending facilities to its policy banks, enabling projects like the shantytown redevelopment of 2015, even better. Boastful municipal officials, however, don’t make a terribly convincing case."
"March 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/06/why-trump-fears-biden-most/,The Washington Post,Why Trump fears Biden most,"To stare down impeachment partly for the chance to take out a rival is the stuff of legend.
If it works. Only now it appears it hasn’t.
Joe Biden’s amazing week not only turned the battle for the Democratic nomination on its head, but it has also dealt President Trump the race he wanted most to avoid.
Just two weeks ago, the president was achieving record (though still shy of 50 percent) approval ratings coming off his impeachment acquittal. It was a strongman’s moment. And payoff appeared on the horizon, as Biden delivered dismal, also-ran finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
But life comes at you fast. First, we all witnessed the wobbly coronavirus response by the White House and the stock market drops that threaten Trump’s central reelection narrative.
And then came the stunning, five day roll-up during which Biden clobbered everyone in South Carolina, collected the endorsements of three former rivals and grabbed the lead in delegates with a 10-state win on Super Tuesday. Within days, two other rivals quit the race. It was a breathless, unprecedented series of back-to-back wins.
The nation is getting a good look at a triumphant former vice president who has stormed the race without the legions of staff, money and small donors that are supposed to be necessary for success.
Instead, Biden is a well-known brand that, while laden with all the attributes of a career D.C. pol, also oozes authenticity and love of country. For all the wounds and warts that come with a politician in twilight, Biden is the rival Trump least wants to face.
It’s been received wisdom for much of the past year that Biden alone among his Democratic competitors was the experienced moderate who would connect with white, blue-collar, pro-Trump voters. While Bernie Sanders and Trump are the emblems of America’s populist surge, Biden embodies the establishment. Isn’t it bad to be part of the establishment? Not when it’s the opposite of what you have now — chaos, conspiracy and incompetence. Biden hails from the land of normalcy and expertise. And voters often go from outsider to insider.
Meanwhile, Trump may have finally bullied an adversary who can outspend him. Instead of a prolonged fight with a New York billionaire, Biden now has Trump nemesis Mike Bloomberg in his corner. Bloomberg wants to pummel Trump; he has made it clear he will spend a great deal even when he is not on the ballot. And Bloomberg-world has the sophistication to match Trump on every platform with complex digital targeting.
Trump on Biden: ‘In many ways he’s worse than Bernie’
President Trump on March 6 called former vice president Joe Biden “left-wing” and slammed his proposed policies on guns and taxes. (The Washington Post)
All of which should be concerning to Republicans who were counting on Sanders and the battle cry of “socialists!” to maintain control of the Senate and pick up House seats. To push back, GOP talking heads will spend the weeks and months ahead pointing to Biden’s gaffes, questions of age and health and of course Hunter Biden’s misadventures in Ukraine.
And Joe Biden will likely at times feed those narratives by fumbling his lines and resorting to his worst instincts to recite his record as a U.S. senator and vice president.
But Biden has one other move that should worry Trump and the Republicans: He has a higher gear that once made him among the best pols of his generation.
He can talk about Americans as a reflection of their best values.
He articulates powerfully about Americans, not about their grievances, but about their empathy and hopes. He says what Trump and Sanders do not say. He speaks to their aspirations and not their fears. He believes in them.
In his 2016 speech to the Democratic convention, he burned with righteous anger about Trump, a man who takes unimaginable delight in saying the words ""You’re fired.” But it’s Biden’s passionate finish about an exceptionalism that comes from Americans themselves that should give butterflies to Republicans. ""Given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down. … Ordinary people like us who do extraordinary things.”
In 2016, that speech was the valedictory oratory of a retiring vice president.
In 2020, that speech should be Joe Biden’s call to arms."

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) as his next White House chief of staff, tapping one of his most stalwart congressional allies to run the White House as he navigates a global health crisis in a reelection year.
“I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Trump tweeted shortly after arriving at his South Florida resort, where he is spending the weekend.
Meadows replaces acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who is being appointed the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland, Trump said in a follow-up tweet. The president thanked Mulvaney for “having served the administration so well.” The envoy position has been vacant under the Trump presidency.
Mulvaney stepped into the role in an acting capacity in early January 2019 on the departure of John F. Kelly. Meadows will be Trump’s fourth White House chief of staff, after Mulvaney, Kelly and Reince Priebus.
Meadows, a four-term lawmaker, announced in December that he would not run for reelection and hinted in his statement that he would join either the administration or Trump’s 2020 campaign.
The former leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus made his mark on Capitol Hill as a frequent thorn in the side of GOP House speakers while developing a close relationship with the president, becoming one of his most fervent defenders.
Trump often calls Meadows early in the morning and late at night, after growing distrustful of House Republican leadership and developing an appreciation of Meadows’s appearances on cable television.
Mulvaney was given advance notice of the tweet, a senior White House official said, but did not learn about the job change until the president had already offered Meadows the job.
Mulvaney’s departure is likely to mean broad changes in the West Wing. He also had been a member of Congress and of the Freedom Caucus before joining the administration, and he installed in government posts a number of die-hard loyalists and conservatives who often bragged about getting things done below the radar.
Some of those aides, particularly his principal deputy, Emma Doyle, had already seen their responsibilities shrink in recent months. Meadows has developed close ties with senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, who advocated for putting him in the post.
Mulvaney had also served as the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget and as the interim head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Russ Vought is now the acting OMB chief and could be nominated for the permanent post, according to two White House officials.
Trump sees Meadows as a fierce political operator who can be helpful to him as he goes into a stretch where his reelection campaign is likely to take him on the road three, and perhaps more, days per week.
The president recently had dinner with Meadows and his wife at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, a White House aide said. And at the recent wedding of White House aides Stephen Miller and Katie Waldman, Meadows sat next to Trump at the head table, attendees said, although Mulvaney did not.
Meadows thanked Trump in a statement Friday night. “It’s an honor to be selected by President Trump to serve alongside him and his team,” he said. “This President and his administration have a long list of incredible victories they’ve delivered to the country during this first term. With the best yet to come — and I look forward to helping build on that success and staying in the fight for the forgotten men and women of America.”
He has recently been at the White House nearly every day, advisers say, meeting with the president and others, particularly Kushner. He was seen last week having lunch with Marc Short, Vice President Pence’s chief of staff, in the White House Mess.
Aides had spoken of the two men having a deal for several months, and Trump began telling people on Thursday evening and Friday morning that he was going to tap Meadows, a person familiar with the choice said.
Meadows was instrumental in Trump’s impeachment defense, sometimes talking to the president four or five times a day, other advisers say. Trump did not have a volcanic falling-out with Mulvaney but never fully trusted him and kept him in the job in an acting capacity.
Like Mulvaney, Meadows is unlikely to prove as stiff a disciplinarian as Kelly, who encouraged the president when leaving to find someone who would challenge him or else he would find himself impeached.
One longtime Trump adviser said it was a questionable choice to install Meadows, given that he has no experience leading such a large operation.
“The president, and I’ve heard him say this, sees Mark as very good politically,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. “But the president is a political animal. He needs someone who will actually take care of the store for him while he’s out running for reelection. And there’s a question in my mind whether Mark can do that.”
Meanwhile, Mulvaney often seemed out of the loop and sometimes even blissful about it.
He regularly traveled away from the president on weekends. When Trump clashed with national security adviser John Bolton last year and fired him, Mulvaney was in North Carolina, politicking for members of Congress.
At times in recent months, one close Trump adviser said, the president would say there was no need to loop Mulvaney into a particular discussion.
Mulvaney did not accompany the president Friday to Tennessee to survey storm damage, Atlanta to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or South Florida for the weekend.
At a White House meeting with Trump, Pence and chief executives of major airlines earlier this week, Mulvaney stood off to the side, even as other senior administration officials sat at the table. Trump has been displeased generally with the administration’s handling of the novel coronavirus and has grown angry with Mulvaney on several occasions, aides said.
In a recent talk at the Oxford Union in England, Mulvaney seemed at peace with the idea that his days could be numbered.
“Generally speaking, this job does not last that long. Who knows how much longer I’m going to last?” Mulvaney said during the February remarks.
Meadows prides himself on being an operator in Washington. He is often at some of the city’s swankiest parties and galas, including the Meridian Ball, and at the British Embassy and other black-tie events. He also maintained close relationships with key congressional Democrats, such as the late representative Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), who was chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.
He keeps a place in North Carolina but has spent much of his time in Washington in recent years.
“Mark is a really savvy strategist. You love him or hate him, but anyone who knows him knows he thinks three-dimensionally at all times,” a senior administration official said. “That’ll be his biggest value-add to the White House. He thinks of angles and approaches that others won’t, and thinks steps ahead. He’ll be crucial in helping get out of the cycle of being totally reactive.”
Some in the president’s orbit, though, worry that Meadows is duplicitous. Several current and former Trump aides say they feel he often tells the president one thing but sometimes tells lawmakers or Capitol Hill staffers something entirely different.

Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, an uncle of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and one of his cousins, Mohammed bin Nayef, were taken into custody Friday morning, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss highly sensitive internal Saudi matters.
The princes were charged with treason, a serious accusation for which they could receive the death penalty.
Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as crown prince and heir to the throne in 2017 when King Salman elevated one of his sons, Mohammed bin Salman, to the role and gave him wide authority to effectively run the kingdom.
Mohammed bin Nayef had earlier served as the country’s interior minister, developing a close working relationship with U.S. security officials.
Both the arrested men could claim a more senior place in the line of succession to Mohammed and were seen as potential rivals to the throne.
The Saudi authorities subsequently detained two close relatives of the senior princes.
The brother of Mohammed bin Nayef, Nawaf bin Nayef, was detained on Friday in the hours following his father’s arrest. On Saturday, the son of Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, Nayef bin Ahmed, was also detained, said the person familiar with the arrests. It was unclear whether they had been taken into custody or placed under house arrest.
The two princes had returned together from a hunting trip late Thursday when they received a call summoning them to meet the crown prince at 7 a.m. Friday at the royal palace, said one of the people who had been briefed on the events by members of the royal family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody, according to the account.
The arrests come at a sensitive time for the kingdom, with oil prices plummeting and Mohammed’s decision to halt visits to Mecca in response to the coronavirus outbreak stoking discontent. The arrests were first reported by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
The royal family also has faced international criticism over the October 2018 murder of Washington Post contributing columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi. The United Nations blamed what it called an “extrajudicial execution” on Saudi state agents, and U.S. intelligence officials have privately told Congress that Mohammed, who is often called by his initials, MBS, was responsible.
The crown prince has been consolidating his power over the past couple of years, seeking to disarm critics and silence dissent at home and abroad.
While he has succeeded in concentrating authority in his own hands to a degree that’s highly unusual in the kingdom, it’s unclear what kind of opposition he might face to becoming king when his elderly father dies. It is also uncertain what may have prompted the reported detentions.
Some Saudi commentators said the arrests suggest rifts within the royal family over the succession of the crown prince, whose strong-arm tactics have alienated many princes.
“The arrest of several senior disgruntled princes such as [Ahmed] and MBN [Mohammed bin Nayef] reflects a growing discontent with the ‘Son King’ over his despicable hegemony and erratic social, economic, foreign and religious policies,” tweeted Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi academic based in London and a fierce critic of the crown prince.
Hugh Miles, editor of ­ArabDigest.org, a subscription service offering political analysis about the Middle East, noted that fissures within the royal family could present long-term difficulties to the crown prince once he takes the throne.
“Although many questions still remain about what has happened in Saudi Arabia in the last 24 hours, what is clear is that MBS is now facing ruling Saudi Arabia without the backing of the rest of the royal family,” said Miles, who is based in Cairo. “This is a major problem for him because any would-be Saudi King is expected not only to have the royal family’s full allegiance, but also to be able to prove it.”
As a son of the founder of the Saudi kingdom, Prince Ahmed was senior in the line of succession but was passed over in favor of a new generation of younger princes. He had been living in Britain, afraid to return after he made comments that appeared to criticize the crown prince. He returned to Saudi Arabia in 2018 following Khashoggi’s killing after being given assurances for his safety, according to the person with knowledge of the arrests.
Mohammed bin Nayef has survived four assassination attempts, including one in which he was injured by an al-Qaeda suicide bomber in 2009.
In 2017, the crown prince ordered the arrests of hundreds of princes, government ministers and business people, detaining some of them in a Ritz-Carlton hotel in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. Ostensibly an anti-corruption crackdown, the sweeps were seen as a part of his effort to consolidate power."
"March 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/08/now-is-time-go-offense-against-trump/,The Washington Post,Now is the time to go on the offense — against Trump,"In his brief spell in the Democratic primaries, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg ran a series of ads and put up billboards mocking President Trump. They taunted Trump for his inflating his wealth, acting disrespectfully during the national anthem, habitually calling people losers and for everything from cheating at golf to ordering cruddy steaks. Some were silly and a little weird.
The efforts were not designed to actually persuade anyone but rather to get under Trump’s skin and present Bloomberg as the guy who could beat Trump at his own game. Bloomberg is out of the race but has said he fully intends to use his fortune to help defeat Trump.
Among others, I have suggested that mass voter registration, litigation against voter suppression laws and sophisticated digital operations should be at the top of Bloomberg’s spending list. However, when it comes to ads, the point should not be to taunt Trump but to mobilize voters and remind those who voted for him in 2016 why they cannot do so again.
There is one message that former vice president Joe Biden may be reluctant to use but that Bloomberg can hammer home: Trump is mentally unfit to hold office — any office, but especially the presidency.
Trump’s statements about the coronavirus, filled with self-congratulations, inanities, falsehoods and non sequiturs, remind us that he is unable to cope with reality; his sole aim is to elevate himself (although his antics make him look ridiculous). He wants a cruise ship to stay offshore so the number of reported cases in the United States will remain artificially low? That’s just nuts, and worse, it is dangerous.
Trump seems to believe that he “knows more about” everything (energy, medicine, diplomacy, nuclear weapons, intelligence, law enforcement, trade, etc.) than anyone, and yet his gaping ignorance and refusal to learn the basic facts imperil the country and the economy. Bloomberg should point this out over and over again.
Trump thinks North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un loves him, so Trump gives up leverage that might force North Korea to denuclearize. Trump trusts the word of Russian President Vladimir Putin over the U.S. intelligence community’s, so Trump refuses to secure America’s elections and tries to extort Ukraine, a U.S. ally. Trump is obsessed with Barack Obama, so he tries to wreck whatever bears his predecessor’s name or is associated with Obama’s legacy, despite his own failure to devise a better alternative (e.g., the Iran deal, Obamacare).
It is not simply that Trump is an ignorant narcissist; rather, the concern is that his ignorant narcissism poses a risk to the country — one that brings us to the brink of war with Iran, emboldens Russia and leaves the United States vulnerable to a pandemic, which in turn may bring on a recession.
Perhaps some voters who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016 did not realize how bad he would be once in office, or they had bet on the Republicans restraining him. Maybe they deeply loathed Hillary Clinton. Now there is no excuse to keep him in power. And Bloomberg’s bottomless wallet should pay for ads to blanket the airwaves reminding them just how dangerous he is.
Moreover, Bloomberg should start now. (Recall how the Obama campaign saturated swing states with anti-Mitt Romney ads in the summer of 2012 before Romney had the money to go on the air.) It is time to fix in voters’ minds that Trump is not only morally reprehensible but also so unfit as to pose a threat to their safety and security."
"March 9, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexico-international-womens-day-march-femicide-strike/2020/03/08/1ca6167c-6153-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html,The Washington Post,"Tens of thousands of Mexican women protest ‘femicide,’ gender-based violence","MEXICO CITY — Women poured into the streets on Sunday to start a two-day protest and national strike against gender-based violence, in what organizers hope will be a turning point for women's rights in a country disfigured by violence and machismo.
About 80,000 women took part in the march in Mexico City, the local government said, making it one of the biggest in the capital in years. Many wore purple, the color symbolizing International Women’s Day, celebrated throughout the world on Sunday. They waved signs reading, “Fight today so we don’t die tomorrow” and “We are the voice of those who are no longer with us.”
“This is a cry of conscience for our society,” said Itzel Zurita, 32, who sells homemade food in Mexico state. She and a friend, Reyna Ayala, 34, a Walmart worker, said they joined the protest because they were horrified by all the women they knew — including in their own families — who had suffered abuse.
“If we don’t raise our voices, when will they hear us?” Zurita asked.
Protests marking International Women’s Day took place around the world, despite fears of the fast-moving coronavirus outbreak, and a few turned violent. Security forces fired tear gas at women’s marches in Turkey and Chile. Islamist hard-liners threw rocks and shoes at a women’s rally in Islamabad, Pakistan.
In Mexico City, masked assailants tossed Molotov cocktails and sprayed gasoline that sparked fires in a few areas, including near the national palace, authorities said. Thirteen people were taken to the hospital with injuries, while dozens more had minor wounds, the city government said. But the march was mostly peaceful.
The annual demonstration for women’s rights here turned into something of a social uprising this year after a string of gruesome killings. Women took to the streets around the country — from U.S. border cities such as Ciudad Juárez to communities in southern Guerrero state, where indigenous women and peasants joined marches.
In Guadalajara, demonstrators dyed the water in a public fountain red to dramatize the spilling of women’s blood. In Mexico City’s central plaza, the Zocalo, activists stenciled the names of victims of “femicide” — women killed based on their gender — on the pavement.
Perla Acevedo, 32, an art gallery worker in Mexico City, had participated in other feminist protests in the capital. But she was on the verge of tears Sunday as she watched the throngs of women marching toward the presidential residence — students, mothers and daughters, transgender activists.
Acevedo said she was protesting “for everything that’s happening every day.” Mexico’s femicide rate rose about 10 percent in 2019 to 1,010 cases; an average of 10 women are killed per day. Surveys have found a majority of women have been victims of violence at some point in their lives.
Mexicans have been jarred by several barbaric murders in recent months, including the slaying and skinning of 25-year-old Ingrid Escamilla, and the killing of Fátima Cecilia Aldrighett Antón, a 7-year-old who was abducted at school.
“I know change isn’t going to happen overnight,” Acevedo said. “But people are talking about this at their dinner tables, in schools. That’s what counts.”
She and other marchers said they planned to participate in a national women’s strike on Monday. Major corporations, universities, state governments and other employers have thrown their support behind the strike, promising not to dock participants’ pay.
“What I think is happening is a collective awakening,” said Peniley Ramírez, a columnist for the daily El Universal. Women had protested in Mexico and other Latin American countries for years, she said. “But now being a feminist is politically correct. This makes a difference. The fact we see companies also becoming feminists, the politicians saying they are feminists, the intellectuals saying they are feminists — we are winning an ideological battle.”
The movement has turned into a significant political challenge for President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has been one of Latin America’s most popular leaders. His approval ratings have slipped as he has responded in what many view as a ham-handed way to the wave of outrage over femicides.
The leftist leader has suggested that Sunday’s demonstration and the women’s strike were engineered in part by his conservative opponents. He’s linked femicide to free-market policies pursued by his predecessors. Initially, he scheduled the launch of a major lottery contest for Monday, before saying “I forgot” it was the day of the women’s strike. He moved it back a day.
“I’m in favor of women’s causes, but I don’t want the separation of men and women,” he told a gathering on Sunday in Zacatecas state.
Ramírez said the president’s attitude further intensified anger over the government’s failure to curb violence against women.
“Many women say, we voted thinking it would be a leftist government, and you’d think, with a cabinet that is half women, that things at least on the level of public discourse would be different,” she said.
Claudia Ramírez, 36, a government economist, was among those propelled into the streets by López Obrador’s remarks.
“The response of this administration leaves a lot to be desired,” she said. “That’s what made me come.”"

He was sent home with acetaminophen and a diagnosis of a sinus infection.
Two weeks later, Thomas Eric Duncan was dead, two nurses who attended him were infected with Ebola and the shortcomings of U.S. preparations for a viral epidemic were vividly exposed.
Now, with word of the first U.S. patient to contract the new virus that has killed 17 people in China comes the inevitable question: Is the United States better prepared for the catastrophic outbreak authorities have long feared?
“The big picture,” said Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who oversaw the Ebola response, “is that we’re better prepared than we were before, but not nearly as prepared as we need to be.”
There is little doubt the country has made big leaps in preparedness since the anthrax scare of 2001, the SARS crisis in 2003, the MERS outbreak of 2014 and the West African Ebola epidemic that ended in 2016, according to experts and reports that evaluated the response to those crises.
Twenty years ago, the nation had few programs or resources dedicated to coordinating the response to an outbreak among federal, state and local agencies and the hospitals that are the front-line protection against an epidemic, said Thomas V. Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Now, he said, agencies like the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, part of the Department of Health and Human Services; the CDC; the Defense Department; and the Department of Homeland Security have spent years and countless millions of dollars training, testing and coordinating with the nation’s health-care facilities for just such an occurrence.
Inglesby said he is confident that hospitals in the five cities that could receive passengers on flights from Wuhan, China — the epicenter of the outbreak — have been warned to be on alert. Under new precautions, anyone traveling from Wuhan will be funneled to airports in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago or Atlanta.
“In major hospitals in big cities, and definitely in the ones where flights will be landing from Wuhan, those people are very well aware of what’s going on,” he said. “It doesn’t mean everyone in the country is properly trained, but the front line is.”
At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, front-line health-care workers who have long asked patients about travel to the Middle East as a way of screening for MERS are also raising questions about travel to China with anyone who complains of the respiratory problems and fever caused by the new virus.
At UCLA and Emory University hospitals, nurses and doctors in the emergency room already ask open-ended questions about travel, officials said.
“I would think my colleagues in hospitals across the United States are doing something very, very similar,” said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt School of Medicine.
The stockpile of drugs and equipment such as ventilators has been expanded, Frieden said, and training for disease response in Asia and Africa has been stepped up.
The science necessary to respond to an outbreak also has progressed rapidly. When the first U.S. patient in the current epidemic, a man in his 30s in Snohomish County, Wash., exhibited symptoms, the CDC was able to test specimens and confirm his diagnosis in 24 hours. The National Institutes of Health and other agencies are already working on a vaccine and treatments. And the Chinese rapidly sequenced the virus’s genome, then distributed the information around the globe within weeks, Schaffner and other officials noted.
Identification of the SARS virus in 2003 took months, and developing a reliable test for the virus took even longer.
But any system is only as good as the information fed into it, and Frieden pointed out in an interview Wednesday how little is still known about the new coronavirus.
How were 14 health-care workers in China infected — from one incident or from numerous patients? Why are some patients in China asymptomatic? How long do the infections last? How many are severe? What characteristics do the 17 people who died share?
“Large parts of the world have really bad diseases spreading that could bite us tomorrow and we don’t know about it,” Frieden said.
At home, the list of deficiencies that could undermine a quick and effective response is lengthy. When an independent panel evaluated the U.S. response to Ebola in 2016, it found “the U.S. government was not well prepared to respond to emergent crises that require a rapid, integrated domestic and international response.” It said U.S. officials “did not demonstrate an appreciation of the public’s perceptions and fear,” and even had trouble supplying enough of the protective suits health-care workers had to wear while treating Ebola patients.
When HHS’s inspector general evaluated hospitals after the Ebola crisis, it found that 71 percent of administrators considered their facilities unprepared to receive Ebola patients in 2014 — a figure that had dropped to 14 percent by 2017.
The first U.S. coronavirus patient offers little evidence of how well the system responded. After returning from two months visiting family in Wuhan and developing symptoms on Jan. 16, he guessed he could have been infected by the virus and sought care at a clinic Jan. 19, John Wiesman, secretary of health for the state of Washington, said Wednesday. The patient appears to have a mild case of the infection. Health authorities said they are monitoring 16 people he came into contact with.
The next person may not be so healthy or well-informed. The question remains: What will happen when he or she walks through the doors of a health facility somewhere in the United States?
“Well-trained and resourced health-care workers will be the key to detecting new cases, implementing infection control procedures — including isolating suspected ill individuals — and treating those who are ill,” said Alexandra L. Phelan, a faculty research instructor at Georgetown University’s Department of Microbiology and Immunology.
“The good news is there has been real progress globally, so progress is possible,” said Frieden, now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a program aimed at preventing epidemics and saving lives from cardiovascular disease. “The bad news is it takes a lot of time. This is not something that gets fixed overnight.”"
"March 9, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/09/this-is-biggest-oil-price-crash-decades-that-may-not-be-great-us-economy/,The Washington Post,This is the biggest oil price crash in decades. That may not be great for the U.S. economy.,"Oil prices crashed Sunday by 30 percent, falling from the already low price of $45 a barrel for Brent crude to $31.52. The reason is that Saudi Arabia has effectively declared a price war in the global oil market, retaliating with steep discounts against Russia’s refusal to work with OPEC. Oil prices were already down in 2020 because of the coronavirus, which is depressing demand for transportation fuels worldwide and especially in China.
This will have big repercussions for U.S. energy producers, which face lower prices and a potential loss of customers, as Saudi Arabia seeks sales volumes at the expense of Russian and U.S. producers. The consequences for geopolitics, however, are even more important.
What happened?
Since 2016, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has worked with Russia and a few other countries to try to boost prices in the global oil market. This group goes by the name OPEC+, but real power lies with just two of its members: Saudi Arabia and Russia, the biggest exporters in the world.
Up until this month, OPEC+ claimed it maintained “cuts” of about 2.1 million barrels per day. In theory, the group boosted prices by restricting supply, but it was never clear how big the cuts actually were. When Saudi Arabia asked Russia this month to cut oil production even further, Russia refused and announced it would no longer respect any restraints. In response, Saudi Arabia said it would expand its oil production to more than 10 million barrels per day, seeking increased market share.
What caused the Saudi-Russia split?
Russia’s reaction should not have been surprising. Russia’s exports make up less than 10 percent of world consumption, which is why it tries to collaborate with OPEC, which collectively produces about 40 percent of world oil.
Yet running an oil cartel is hard, because no member really wants to cut its own oil production — and lose sales — to boost the overall price. Members promise to contribute to collective cuts, but neither OPEC nor OPEC+ has real power to make sure its members keep their promises. My research shows that OPEC cheats on its agreements about 96 percent of the time.
In reality, Russia’s “cuts” under OPEC+ probably did not reduce its production by much. So when Saudi Arabia pushed for cuts that might be more painful, Russia decided it didn’t make economic sense.
Now, Russia may think that its best way forward is to maintain high levels of production and hope its American competitors go bankrupt, leading to higher prices. Russia’s current oil wells probably run an operational profit even at relatively low prices, even if they don’t cover the full capital costs of drilling the well.
If Russia and the rest of OPEC aren’t helping, Saudi Arabia doesn’t have much incentive to restrict its own production. It learned this the hard way in the early 1980s. Prices fell dramatically, even though Saudi Arabia cut 70 percent of its production, losing a lot of market share. The Saudis are determined not to make the same mistake again.
On the one hand, low prices might hurt the U.S. economy
Lower oil prices are a mixed blessing for the United States. Lower gasoline prices will benefit consumers and lower transportation costs for businesses. However, they are very bad for U.S. oil producers. Highly indebted fracking firms may not be able to obtain further bank loans or perhaps even stay in business. States such as Texas and North Dakota, where fossil fuel extraction is a big part of the economy, would face hard times.
The pain could spread to the entire U.S. economy. If low prices continue for months or years, there will probably be bankruptcies and mergers in the oil sector, perhaps lowering gross domestic product or exacerbating the stock market decline on Wall Street.
On the other, they may help peace efforts in the Middle East
Saudi Arabia is fighting a war in Yemen. Russia is intervening in Syria. Both use oil money to finance their war machines. As my research shows, oil wealth can make states with aggressive intentions more likely to act on those intentions. That kind of “petro-aggression” leads those states into 3½ times as many military conflicts as typical countries.
Political scientist Cullen Hendrix finds evidence that lower oil prices actually lead to less interstate conflict. Wars depend on many other things than oil prices, of course. Still, a prolonged period of low oil revenue might cause even a very rich country like Saudi Arabia to rethink its incursion into Yemen.
Cheap oil has mixed consequences for climate change
Lower oil prices are also a double-edged sword for climate change. In the United States, they could deprive oil firms of spare resources to pour into lobbying efforts against legislation on climate change. My research with Jessica Green and Thomas Hale suggests that kind of political obstruction is instrumental in preventing green initiatives.
Globally, however, low oil prices might make it harder for electric and hybrid vehicles to compete with conventional cars, slowing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The U.S.-Saudi relationship could sour
Saudi Arabia’s decision was a clear jab at Russia, as it seeks to seize market share, but it also hurts U.S. producers. In the past, U.S. governments have put pressure on the Saudis not to do such things. This time around, the Saudis seem unconcerned about the White House reaction. That is understandable, given President Trump’s unconditional support of the Saudis to date, on issues ranging from the Yemen war to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Still, low oil prices might push Trump to think again. His claim that the United States enjoys “energy dominance” is looking increasingly hollow. If low oil prices start an avalanche on the stock market, even Republican supporters in the oil sector will want some answers about Saudi actions. Trump might yet turn on Saudi Arabia."

Central banks should be prepared to provide liquidity to banks and financial companies, especially those who lend to more vulnerable small- and medium-sized businesses, Gita Gopinath said in a blog post Monday. Broader monetary stimulus such as interest-rate cuts or asset purchases can boost confidence and support financial markets if there’s a risk of a significant tightening in financial conditions, she said.
Governments and central banks last week stepped up emergency actions, with the Bank of Canada joining the Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates by a half point. More than $54 billion in budget support has already been pledged or is under consideration in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

Broad-based fiscal stimulus can help boost aggregate demand but would be more effective once business operations begin to normalize, Gopinath said. Families and businesses could benefit from cash transfers, wage subsidies and tax relief to help them meet their needs, she added.
“There is a need for urgent action, and not just targeted policies, but substantial targeted policies,” Gopinath said in a Bloomberg Television later Monday. “In this particular case, you could think of fiscal policy as being in the driver’s seat, because that’s where you could do a lot more targeted policies.”

Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said last week that the global economic outlook has shifted to “more dire scenarios” as the virus has spread undetected and that it’s still difficult to predict the impact. The IMF is making available $50 billion to help countries deal with the virus, including $10 billion at zero interest for the poorest nations.
The IMF expects that global growth this year will be slower than 2019, when growth was 2.9%, Georgieva said last week, adding that the official forecast will be updated next month. The IMF had previously seen 2020 growth accelerating to 3.3%.

Gopinath said that Monday’s plunge in oil may be a net negative rather than a relief for the global economy as the hit to crude exporters outweighs any tailwind for countries that benefit from cheaper prices.
For the virus, global infections have surpassed 110,000, resulting in more than 3,900 deaths since the virus originated in Wuhan, China.
“It’s very important that policies respond quickly to prevent this turning into a permanent crisis,” Gopinath said in the interview. “If all goes well and the necessary actions are taken, then 2021 would see a strong recovery, but we need to move fast now.”"
"March 10, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/roads-to-nowhere-wont-lead-china-out-of-crisis/2020/03/10/f969bfcc-629e-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html,The Washington Post,Why $3.6 Trillion of Roads Will Never Be Enough,"With the coronavirus shutting down large parts of China, plans for big infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy are rising. But what will be built, and for whom?  
The scale seems striking. Several provinces have cumulatively announced plans to build or restart around 25 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) of projects over the next few years. For 2020, that amounts to around 3.5 trillion yuan of expenditure. To finance this building spree, around 950 billion yuan of special bonds were issued in the first two months of the year, with close to 70% for infrastructure.Work has resumed on more than 500 major highway and waterway projects that had been halted with the outbreak, and local governments are pushing for more. There are also some encouraging indicators as the country begins to emerge from lockdown. Factory restarts and return-to-work numbers are getting better. Rail and freight data are edging up. Machine operating rates have been rising at a faster pace than workers are returning to their jobs, suggesting a rush to show construction activity and boost sentiment.  Whether all this building actually gets done is one issue. China has large swathes of land and rural areas outside the southern and eastern regions that could use infrastructure, but they have always needed an uplift. A more pressing question is what purpose is served besides deploying money on roads to nowhere. The economy remains hung-over from excesses of past stimuli. Will one more highway in the hinterland boost car sales? Can a maglev rail line ease pressures on crippled industrial and tech supply chains?
Much of the spending is intended to address an impending hit to growth from the virus and the latent effects of  the trade war with the U.S. It comes as the central and local governments race to meet targets under the current five-year plan while heading into a new one. But attempting to prop up growth numbers won’t return workers to the parts of the economy that need it most or get companies the parts they need.The headline numbers might not even be met. A 1% increase in infrastructure investment can lift nominal gross domestic product by 0.1 percentage points, according to HSBC Holdings Plc analysts. That means, they say, that such spending needs to grow by 10% to 12%, from 6% to 8% previously, to help reach the growth target of at least 5.7%.(1) Home-bound investors have cheered the prospect of infrastructure stimulus, China’s fallback in tough times. Stock prices of domestic construction machinery makers Sany Heavy Industry Co. and Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co., which should benefit from a push to build, have far outpaced the benchmark Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index over the last month, even as large parts of China were effectively shut.
The foundations of such hope-based bets are flimsy. Spending doesn’t directly translate to growth because it includes outlays on land acquisition, for instance. In addition, a look at machine-operating rates as of February shows that activity has increased most in the already built-up southern and coastal regions. Meanwhile, the companies that are back to work are mainly state-backed. The country needs factories to be up and running, not smoother roads.
Part of what’s driving these stocks to multi-year highs is that Beijing is pulling out all the stops. They’re off by a few percentage points in the latest rout, but heading up again.
Hundreds of billions of yuan are being funneled to local governments with pressured finances. The issuance of special bonds amounts to directly injecting cash into the construction sector. Approval for the new projects comes straight from the top, arguably ensuring better quality. Yet even if all this building takes off, where will the trucks and excavators come from if parts factories aren’t operating? Demand was already high pre-virus as old machines were being replaced, but growth was coming down from double-digits.
None of these measures address the problem at a hand: an economy with broken supply chains. Beijing’s reflex to build its way out of trouble is the wrong one for this crisis. President Xi Jinping says the government will back “new infrastructure” that includes 5G telecom networks and data centers. Those plans may yield results in a few years, but not in the next two quarters, when the hit to growth and manufacturing will likely be severe.
China has been through this before. If there’s one lesson from its state-sanctioned discretionary spending, it’s that public investment is no longer efficient in China and real return rates have dropped.  Each yuan does less for the economy as debt piles up and deepens China Inc.’s existing balance sheet problems. The benefits end up with the state sector, not the smaller and more fragile private side. China needs, as soon as possible, to alleviate the pain from the supply shock that is spilling over and worsening demand. Trucks and excavators can only do so much.  
To all this, add fiscal constraints. The virus has brought extra costs, with public expenditure totaling at least 90 billion yuan, according to HSBC’s analysts. But revenues are slowing, thanks to tax cuts and measures to boost demand.  
China’s road to nowhere will be a bumpy one. 
(1) In their base case scenario, the analysts assume that the virus outbreak will be better contained in March. They expect real GDP growth to slow to 4.1% from a year earlier in the first quarter, and 5.1% the second quarter, before recovering to 6.0% in the third quarter. They have cut their 2020 real GDP growth forecast to 5.3% from 5.8% previously.They also assume that China’s “around 6%” target indicates that growth should be no lower than 5.7% this year."

"March 10, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russias-ruling-party-proposes-path-for-putin-to-stay-in-power-past-2024/2020/03/10/e55870a6-62c5-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html,The Washington Post,Russia’s ruling party proposes path for Putin to stay in power past 2024,"MOSCOW — Russia’s parliament offered a path Tuesday for President Vladi­mir Putin to stay in power for an additional 12 years after his term expires in 2024, approving an amendment that would reset his presidential terms.
The plan, floated and supported by Putin’s United Russia party, is part of a sweeping rewrite of Russia’s constitution that many view as a way for Putin to retain control of Russia well into the next decade.
The term-limit proposal was met with applause when it was introduced by State Duma deputy Valentina Tereshkova, beloved nationally as the first woman in space. The plan would reset the current term limits to zero, meaning Putin could run twice more for the presidency, once a restructured constitution is adopted.
“I propose that we either lift the restriction on the number of presidential terms or indicate in an article of this bill that the incumbent president, just like any other citizen, has the right to run for president after the updated constitution takes effect,” Tereshkova said.
Parliament then adjourned for 90 minutes to phone Putin and ask for his thoughts. That prompted him to make a rare in-person appearance.
He said he was against eliminating presidential term limits altogether. However, if Russia’s Constitutional Court says that resetting term limits is legal, that amendment and other proposed constitutional changes can be approved in a nationwide vote on April 22.
Putin, 67, has been in power for 20 years. He first proposed the constitutional changes in his January address to parliament, including limiting presidential terms to two.
“I am actually positive that a strong presidential vertical is absolutely necessary for our country,” he said Tuesday.
“I am sure a time will come when supreme presidential power in Russia will not be, so to speak, personalized so much and will not be centered on one particular person,” Putin added.
When the constitutional changes were proposed in January, analysts speculated that they could be an avenue for Putin to retain influence past his current presidential term. One of his suggestions was “enshrining” the State Council, which advises the president, in the constitution and giving it vague and broad power, including say in foreign policy. That led some to believe Putin’s post-2024 plan was to head that body.
But in a recent visit to the factory city of Ivanovo, roughly 150 miles from Moscow, Putin rejected that notion.
“There are suggestions to give the State Council some special powers and [for me to] become the head of that State Council. What will it mean? It will amount to the situation of diarchy in our country. Such a situation is absolutely fatal for Russia,” Putin said Friday.
He reiterated that point Tuesday: “Vesting other authorities, centers of authority, such as the Security Council or the State Council, particularly, which are not directly elected by the people, with any serious powers related to the presidency, in my opinion, would be wrong and unacceptable and, furthermore, dangerous.”
The proposed term-limit amendment comes a day after the value of the Russian ruble plummeted to its lowest level in more than four years, responding to a dramatic drop in oil prices after the collapse of Russia’s cooperative agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Tuesday’s proposal “will calm everyone down,” Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the upper house of parliament, told reporters in comments broadcast on state-run television.
Lev Gudkov, director of the Levada Center, Russia’s lone independent pollster, said the depreciation of the ruble, coupled with concern about a coronavirus outbreak that is spreading around the world, “will undoubtedly affect the attitude of the Russian population to Putin and to the Russian government in general” and that an “upcoming sharp rise in consumer prices, a jump in inflation and a rise in the cost of living will increase the degree of discontent.”
In his address to parliament on Tuesday, Putin said he was “absolutely positive” Russia “will go through this period in a commendable manner.” He also said the country has “had enough revolutions.”
He concluded: ‘I’m sure that together, we will do many more great things, at least until 2024. Then, we will see.”"

The pneumonia-like disease has claimed 42 lives — all in China — and infected more than 1,200 people there. An official at the World Health Organization told reporters that his agency has begun planning for an outbreak that will last for months.
Infections have been confirmed in South Korea, Japan, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Taiwan, as well as France, Australia and the United States as the disease spreads outside Asia.
At least 50 people are under observation for the illness in 22 U.S. states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The second U.S. patient is a woman, a Chicago resident, who traveled to Wuhan, China — where the virus originated — in late December and returned Jan. 13, the CDC announced Friday. A few days later, she began to feel ill and saw a doctor. She was asked about her travel history, then referred to a hospital, which isolated her and arranged for testing.
The woman is in stable condition but will remain in the hospital mainly to ensure she does not spread the virus. On Tuesday, authorities revealed the first U.S. case, a man in his 30s from Snohomish County, Wash., who had recently returned from a visit to Wuhan. Authorities said they are monitoring 50 of the man’s contacts for signs of infection.
The CDC deployed a team to help with the Chicago case. The woman “has not had any extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning, and that should be very reassuring to the public,” Allison Arwady, Chicago’s public health commissioner, told reporters Friday.
Health officials briefed about two dozen senators Friday. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he “wouldn’t be surprised if there are additional cases.” But he said public-health authorities acted quickly in Illinois, where they “identified, isolated and did contact tracing on the people with whom that person came into contact. That’s how you get your handle on an outbreak.”
After the briefing, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) called on President Trump to declare the outbreak a public-health emergency.
Although the outbreak is a “very serious public-health threat, the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in a briefing Friday.
Circumstances in the United States were overshadowed by the apparently deteriorating conditions in China. The Chinese medical system is struggling to cope with the outbreak, amid reports of overcrowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies.
A doctor who had been working on the front line of efforts to control the disease in Wuhan died Saturday, Chinese state media reported. Liang Wudong was 62 and had retired a year ago, according to staff at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, but was apparently called back to work to help combat the disease. He fell ill with suspected coronavirus on Jan. 16 before being transferred to another hospital in the city as a patient.
A ban on travel was extended to 14 cities, with a total population of more than 35 million in central China’s Hubei province. Tunnels under the Yangtze River were blocked to stop the flow of traffic, and all ride-hailing services in Wuhan were halted at midday Friday. Only half the city’s taxis are allowed on the road each day.
China Southern, the country’s biggest airline, had already canceled flights in and out of Wuhan airport on Thursday. The other two main carriers, Air China and China Eastern, said they would cancel all Wuhan flights from Friday until at least Feb. 8.
As the Lunar New Year began, authorities have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that normally accompany the nation’s biggest holiday. Large public gatherings could aid the spread of the airborne virus.
Nevertheless, state broadcaster CCTV led its midday news program with a report about a huge banquet in Beijing attended by President Xi Jinping and other Communist Party leaders. None of them was wearing a mask, and the report made no mention of the virus outbreak.
Other senior Chinese officials came under heavy criticism for their slow response to the outbreak. The mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, allowed a huge potluck banquet to proceed Sunday, during a weekend when the number of confirmed infections shot up dramatically. The city had arranged a Lunar New Year meal featuring 14,000 dishes for more than 40,000 people, an event it hoped to get listed in Guinness World Records.
Residents were also surprised by photos and video of the two top officials in Hubei province — the Communist Party secretary and the governor — at a dance performance in Wuhan to celebrate the arrival of the Spring Festival holiday. They were sharply criticized for enjoying themselves instead of working on the response to the health crisis.
The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Shanghai Disneyland, which normally has 10 million visitors a year, announced Friday that it would shut down indefinitely starting Saturday.
Production companies have postponed the release of seven films over the holiday, prompting Chinese cinema companies to close the country’s 70,000 movie theaters.
Schools in Hubei province, due to begin the spring semester after the holiday, will not open their doors as planned but will wait for further guidance from health authorities. The Education Ministry instructed universities around China to delay their opening dates if necessary.
Workers are racing to build a 1,000-bed hospital for people with the disease in Wuhan, an indication that Chinese officials expect, or already have, a much larger number of cases. It is modeled after a medical facility specially built in 2003 for patients with SARS, another respiratory infection that began in China and claimed more than 750 lives in more than a dozen countries. The new virus is closely related to the SARS coronavirus.
China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency said the new hospital is needed “to address the insufficiency of existing medical resources.”
One of the most recent fatalities was a young, previously healthy man in Wuhan, raising concerns about the deadliness of the virus. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics since he was admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.
Until now, the vast majority of victims have been older than 60 with underlying health conditions.
Aside from 1,287 confirmed cases of infection, a total of 8,420 people are reported to be under observation in China.
Despite the escalating toll, some analysts remained concerned that the Chinese government was significantly underreporting the number of cases. A financial analyst for the investment firm Raymond James told clients in a report Thursday night that he believes the numbers are likely at least 10 times the publicly reported total.
With transportation restrictions imposed by China, U.S. officials said Friday they are assessing the extent and duration of screening travelers from Wuhan to airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Chicago. The lockdown in Wuhan and nearby cities means fewer travelers from there are arriving in the United States.
The labor-intensive airport screening is being conducted by the CDC. But sick patients with no symptoms might not be detected.
To control the spread of the virus, resources must be focused at the state and local levels, where front-line health officials are trying to rapidly identify cases, said Martin Cetron, director of the CDC’s division of global migration and quarantine."
"March 11, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/moscow-got-itself-into-an-oil-price-war-with-saudi-arabia-a-major-gamble-for-russias-economy/2020/03/10/94c01bca-6226-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html,The Washington Post,"Moscow got itself into an oil price war with Saudi Arabia, a major gamble for Russia’s economy","MOSCOW — An oil price war between Russia and OPEC giant Saudi Arabia has done more than upend markets amid wider economic turmoil from the coronavirus outbreak. It has put Moscow into a potentially costly gamble.
The value of the ruble plummeted along with the cost of oil, with the currency hitting its lowest level in more than four years Tuesday. That has stirred fears of a recession in Russia, whose economy was already wobbly from sanctions.
None of this is likely to pose any immediate political pitfalls for President Vladi­mir Putin. The country is in the middle of major overhaul of the constitution that — one way or another — is likely to keep Putin’s grip on Russia after his term ends in four years.
Still, there is “high level of uncertainty in Russia,” said Marcel Salikhov, director of economic research at the Institute for Energy and Finance, a Moscow-based think tank.
“The economic politics is changing,” he said. “The [ruble exchange] rate is volatile and that’s why we now have high inflation expectations.”
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had asked Russia — not a formal member of the cartel — to further cut oil production by around 500,000 barrels a day. The reduction sought to support prices and address a slumping demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
The Kremlin refused, turned the global oil market on its head — and perhaps directly targeting the U.S. shale industry in the process.
The sudden collapse of Russia’s OPEC cooperative agreement, called OPEC+, caused a one-day plunge of more than 30 percent in oil prices Monday as Russia and Saudi Arabia vowed to pump more to compete for market share. It was the biggest one-day decline since 1991. Oil prices moved higher Tuesday.
Why did Russia refuse?
Moscow’s motivations appear to be tied to the burgeoning American shale industry, which hasn’t been under any obligation to stem production but has been bolstered by OPEC+ propping up prices.
Russia’s state-owned oil producer Rosneft, led by Igor Sechin, a close Putin ally, has been especially vocal in its opposition to OPEC+.
“From the point of view of Russian interests, this deal [to cut production] is simply meaningless,” Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontiev told Russian media, who suggested that any OPEC+ cut would “clear a place” for American shale oil.
“Our volumes are simply replaced by the volumes of our competitors,” he said. “This is masochism.”
Meanwhile, the Kremlin has denounced U.S. sanctions hampering the conclusion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would link Russia’s gas to Germany and, more broadly, the rest of Europe. Washington has also sanctioned a subsidiary of Rosneft for its ties to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met Monday with Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov to discuss “compliance with sanctions programs, Venezuelan economic conditions, and the potential for trade and investment,” according to the Treasury Department’s readout of the talks.
“Secretary Mnuchin emphasized the importance of orderly energy markets,” the statement said.
Mikhail Krutikhin, an energy analyst at the Moscow-based RusEnergy consulting firm, said he doesn’t believe Russia’s refusal to curb production was related to political revenge but rather the logistical difficulties.
“It’s not Saudi Arabia,” Krutikhin said. “The Saudis are very flexible in their oil production, but Russia is not.”
How do lower oil prices hit Russia?
Rystad Energy, an industry consulting firm, said the effect of the OPEC+ collapse “surpassed even our expectations,” dropping to $31 per barrel at the opening of Asian trading Tuesday.
Monday was a public holiday in Russia, but Russia’s energy minister, Alexander Novak, was called to an emergency government meeting.
Russia is reliant on energy exports. “The backbone of the Russian economy,” Krutikhin said. But one safety net is the country’s substantial hard currency reserves.
Russia’s Finance Ministry said Monday that it could withstand oil prices of $25 to $30 a barrel for six to 10 years, covered by the country’s National Welfare Fund, which it says stands at more than $150 billion.
While Russia says it could survive years of low prices, it also would level a serious blow to the country’s GDP, analysts said.
That’s why Novak hasn’t ruled out the possibility of a new OPEC+ agreement in the summer. In late December, he stated his support for OPEC+, noting that it brought in more than $83 billion of additional revenue for Russia’s federal budget.
“I don’t think the ruble is going to recover,” Krutikhin said. “It’s not good for ordinary Russians who have to rely on imported goods. Russia is very much dependent on imports, and it’s going to be a big blow for Russians.”
In a surprise appearance at a parliament session Tuesday, Putin made reference to the slumping oil prices, expressing confidence that the “economy will strengthen, and leading manufacturing industries will grow stronger and more competitive.”
Lev Gudkov, director of the Levada-Center, Russia’s lone independent pollster, said Putin’s popularity could take a hit as a result of the economic downturn — though probably not immediately.
“If the crisis continues for a long time, and its impact on the primitive Russian economy is more significant than it seems today, then in two years Putin's popularity will significantly decrease to a critical 25 to 35 percent,” Gudkov said. “Mass illusions about his ability to maintain the status quo in the country will be eroded and noticeably weakened.”"
"March 11, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/wells-fargos-culture-was-broken-new-ceo-tells-lawmakers/,The Washington Post,"Wells Fargo’s culture was ‘broken,’ new CEO tells lawmakers","Wells Fargo has suffered from a broken culture and failed leadership but can turn itself around, its new CEO told lawmakers Tuesday, in the bank’s latest pitch to emerge from years of scandal and controversy.
Charles Scharf is the third Wells Fargo chief executive in three years to try to convince Congress that he can turn around the troubled bank. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, started the hearing by telling Scharf, who started in October, that the two CEOs who preceded him resigned shortly after testifying, eliciting laughs in the room.
“I wish you luck,” Waters said. “It is clear to this committee that the bank you inherited is essentially a lawless organization that has caused widespread harm to millions of consumers throughout the nation.”
Wells Fargo is an important financial institution that was badly managed but is undergoing a major overhaul, Scharf told the committee. “People can trust Wells Fargo to do the right thing,” he told the committee.
Scharf’s efforts to rebuild the bank’s reputation became more difficult last week when the Financial Services Committee released a more than 100-page report that found the bank repeatedly failed to live up to regulators’ demands that it repay consumers and didn’t aggressively address its cultural problems, despite public promises. Two of the bank’s board members resigned Sunday after the report showed they had resisted becoming involved in addressing Wells Fargo’s problems.
On Tuesday, Waters asked the Justice Department to investigate statements former Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan made to the committee last year, which the committee report called “inaccurate and misleading.”
“Because this matter involves a potential violation of a federal criminal statute, I am requesting that the DOJ review Mr. Sloan’s testimony,” Waters said in a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr. The Justice Department declined to comment.
Sloan’s attorney, Josh Cohen, said in a statement: “The allegation that Tim Sloan provided inaccurate and misleading testimony to the House Financial Services Committee is completely unfounded. Mr. Sloan described the considerable efforts that Wells Fargo made under his leadership to comply with the consent orders and directives of regulators. His testimony to the Committee about those efforts was truthful and in good faith.”
Scharf told the committee that he found the details in the House report confirmed his conclusion that the bank had been poorly managed. “These matters describe deeply disturbing conduct that is utterly unacceptable and has no place in our company,” he said.
The bank is being reorganized, and new leaders have been brought in, said Scharf, adding that he spends 75 percent to 80 percent of his time addressing Wells Fargo’s regulatory headaches rather than growing its business. “Simply said, we had a flawed business model in how the company was managed,” he said. “We have not yet done what is necessary to address our shortcomings.”
The questioning of Scharf was generally less contentious than that of his predecessors as he repeatedly acknowledged the bank’s faults and reminded lawmakers that he wasn’t at Wells Fargo during the worst consumer abuses. “For the life of me, I don’t know why you took this job,” said Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.), a sentiment repeated by several other lawmakers.
Among the country’s largest and most profitable banks, Wells Fargo has struggled to overcome a scandal involving fake accounts. That scandal ballooned as the bank admitted to other consumer abuses, including mistakenly foreclosing on hundreds of clients and repossessing the cars of thousands of others.
Last month, the bank reached a $3 billion settlement with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, acknowledging that for more than a decade, thousands of employees falsified records, forged signatures and misused customers’ personal information to meet unrealistic sales goals, in the process opening millions of accounts that consumers didn’t want.
“As we sit here today, we have not yet re-earned the trust that I would like the Wells Fargo name to represent,” Scharf told the committee. But “we in fact can do that.”
Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (N.C.), the ranking Republican on the committee, said although Wells Fargo was “grossly mismanaged,” calls by some Democrats to break up the bank, which has nearly $2 trillion in assets, were ill-advised. “We know breaking up the bank is not the answer,” he said.
Rather than holding three hearings on Wells Fargo this month, the committee should focus on more pressing issues, including the spread of the novel coronavirus, McHenry said. “Our constituents have real concerns,” he said.
Two former Wells Fargo board members are scheduled to testify Wednesday, and several bank employees will testify later this month."

The decision by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, comes as Democrats have attacked the probe as politically motivated, especially as Biden surges in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination and the chance to face President Trump. Some have warned it could play into Russian efforts to spread disinformation ahead of the presidential election in November.
In a message Wednesday to members of the panel, sent roughly an hour before a planned vote, Johnson said he would indefinitely postpone the subpoena for documents and testimony from Andrii Telizhenko, a Ukrainian national who worked for a U.S. lobbying firm that acted on behalf of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden as a board member.
Johnson said he was doing so “[o]ut of an abundance of caution and to allow time for [senators] to receive additional briefings.”
But Johnson indicated that the investigation would continue. He said in an interview Wednesday that he would instead seek to directly subpoena the lobbying firm, Blue Star Strategies.
“My concern is they have not been cooperative,” he said. “If we can get all the records, get all the answers, that’s great. If not, we’re going to have to continue and use other measures.”
While Johnson said he withdrew plans for the Telizhenko subpoena to win bipartisan support for his probe, the bigger issue may have been qualms among his fellow Republicans.
Two GOP panel members, Mitt Romney of Utah and Rob Portman of Ohio, signaled discomfort with the subpoena. Romney, after initially criticizing the appearance that the probe was politically motivated, announced last week he would vote for the subpoena. Portman privately expressed concerns about the reliability of any information Telizhenko might share.
Portman declined to answer when asked whether he withheld his vote for the Telizhenko subpoena, forcing Johnson to change course. “I think he’s made the right decision,” he said.
Romney also praised the move: “I applaud his decision to take a close look at this and to see if we could find a proposal that meets with the support of both parties.”
Asked whether he had the votes to move forward with the Telizhenko subpoena, Johnson said, “Yes, at some point.”
“It is what it is,” he added. “We will continue to iron out the discrepancies that were raised over the last couple days, and I can’t really get into much more than that.”
Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the top Democrat on the committee, had called for additional intelligence and law enforcement briefings for panel members on, among other things, whether pursuing investigations of the Bidens and Burisma was assisting the ongoing Russian campaign to interfere in Western elections.
“I appreciate the chairman’s willingness to work with me and all of our committee members regarding significant concerns about foreign election interference,” Peters said. “I look forward to working with Chairman Johnson to get these intelligence community briefings for our committee members. In the meantime, our committee should focus on addressing pressing threats like coronavirus to keep Americans safe.”
Peters and the panel’s other Democrats objected to the Telizhenko subpoena, forcing the planned vote Wednesday.
Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, earning significant pay, at a time when his father was acting on behalf of the Obama administration to combat corruption in Ukraine. But no evidence has emerged to suggest that Joe Biden acted in his family’s interest in that capacity.
The investigation is already playing a role in the presidential campaign — barely a month after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Trump on impeachment charges based on his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
The pro-Trump Great America super PAC on Wednesday launched a digital ad campaign attacking Joe Biden, a day after he solidified his status as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by winning primaries in Michigan and several other states.
“Why is the U.S. Senate investigating Joe Biden’s family?” the ad asks, answering the question with a thinly sourced case that Biden acted to benefit his son and calling him “Quid Pro Quo Joe.”"

“This is not a financial crisis,” said Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat, who was among a dozen financial leaders summoned to the White House Wednesday. “Banks and the financial system are in sound shape and we are here to help.”
The group of executives pledged to help small businesses and consumers get through any economic damage as the virus continues to spread. They also encouraged the government to support fiscal stimulus policies. None of the bankers asked for regulatory relief.
‘Pent-up Demand’
Trump praised the attendees as “the greatest bankers in the world” and predicted that markets and the economy would soon rebound. “I think you’re going to see a tremendous pent-up demand, which hopefully won’t be in the too distant future.” The president added that he plans to make a statement at 9 p.m. Washington time on how he’ll deal with coronavirus, noting that “we don’t need stimulus” if it goes away quickly.
But even as the industry presented a unified sense of calm, fresh evidence emerged that the market tumult was growing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped into a bear market for the first time in 11 years and all but 10 stocks in the S&P 500 index were down in Wednesday trading.
And there are signs that executives see more trouble on the horizon. Corporations -- preparing for the possibility of a drawn out slump -- started to tap funding sources. Private equity giant Blackstone Group Inc. asked companies it controls to draw down their bank credit lines to help prevent liquidity shortfalls. The firm’s CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, was among executives at the meeting with Trump.
‘Great Shape’
“The financial system of the U.S. is in great shape and is prepared to handle this problem,” Schwarzman told the president.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the group that the president has “quite significant” executive powers to deal with any fallout and could roll out proposals “quickly on that front.”
Before the meeting in the White House Cabinet Room was opened to the media, the bank executives were given an impromptu briefing by the officials leading the government’s coronavirus response, including Vice President Mike Pence and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci, attendees said.
Trump also took the CEOs on a tour of the Oval Office and posed for photos with them."
"March 12, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/dc-mayor-signs-law-banning-ghost-gun-kits-from-district/2020/03/11/07c36f56-6393-11ea-b3fc-7841686c5c57_story.html,The Washington Post,D.C. mayor signs law banning ‘ghost gun’ kits from District,"D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) on Wednesday signed emergency legislation banning kits used to make untraceable “ghost guns” after the number of home-built firearms seized by police in the city spiked last year.
The D.C. Council swiftly passed the bill in a unanimous vote last week. It came after authorities learned that ghost guns were used in four recent fatal shootings, and another was fired at two reserve officers in what the police chief called an assassination attempt.
Ghost guns are so named because they aren’t built by traditional manufacturers and lack serial numbers used to trace ownership. The number of such firearms found at crime scenes, at arrests and in homes in the District rose from three in 2017 to 116 in 2019. At least another 38 have been seized this year.
Citing urgency, the mayor sought emergency status to bypass the normal process for enacting legislation. The new law will be in place for 90 days, and officials said they hope to enact a permanent law during that period.
Bowser signed the bill in private, after canceling a public ceremony that had been scheduled at Garfield Elementary School in the Buena Vista Terrace neighborhood in Southeast Washington. Bowser had to deal with pressing matters regarding the coronavirus.
The mayor had planned to tour the community located in Ward 8, where more than a third of the District’s homicides have occurred since 2018. Last year, the District had the highest number of homicides in a decade, and this year it is on a similar pace.
In a joint statement, Bowser and Council Member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), who chairs the committee on the judiciary and public safety, said the new law will help authorities “stop the proliferation of untraceable guns and guns that people buy online and build at home in an attempt to get around the District’s carefully crafted, common sense gun laws.”
While home-built guns vary in quality, they all resemble traditionally made semiautomatic handguns and rifles. The types of ghost guns being used in the District, and in other cities, are made with kits that supply 80 percent of the gun — called the frame for handguns or the receiver for long guns — already cut out of metal or polymer.
Some minor drilling and milling is needed to add the other 20 percent. Both the “80 percent lowers” and the 20 percent remainder — the trigger, barrel and firing pin — are easily purchased online.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has ruled that the 80 percent lower is not a firearm because it is unfinished and cannot fire a projectile. For this reason, there is no requirement that people buying the receivers undergo a background check, making them readily available to individuals such as felons or domestic abusers, with instructions for finishing the guns easily available on the Internet.
Gun rights advocates object to new laws such as the one going into effect in the District. They say that builders of ghost guns should be treated no differently from more-traditional gun manufacturers and that authorities should focus on people illegally distributing firearms.
Police said 2,299 illegal firearms were seized in the District in 2019, a 19 percent increase over the previous year.
In his opening remarks at a recent D.C. Council hearing, Police Chief Peter Newsham called trafficking in firearms more serious than possessing illegal weapons. He said targeting traffickers can “deter people from selling guns in the District, which endanger our residents, visitors and neighborhoods.”
But because ghost guns are in effect untraceable, it makes it difficult for law enforcement to find their source. Newsham has said detectives and federal agencies in the District have at least two investigations open “where we have found some folks that are assembling these guns.” He has declined to comment further.
Assembling a gun out of parts obtained through a gun dealer or the Internet is largely legal in the United States. Four states have enacted laws regulating or prohibiting such guns. It is illegal to build a firearm in the District; the new law makes it illegal for residents to possess the kits.
Officials said the makers of the kits have stopped selling them in other states that enacted similar bans."
"March 12, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/03/11/us-coalition-troops-killed-rocket-attack-iraq-potentially-spiking-tensions-with-iran/,The Washington Post,"U.S. and coalition troops killed in rocket attack in Iraq, potentially spiking tensions with Iran","Two Americans and one other coalition member were killed in a rocket attack on a base in Iraq on Wednesday night, a U.S. military spokesman said, potentially spiking tensions with Iran about two months after a series of bloody events that were capped by the death of an Iranian general in a U.S. drone strike.
At least 12 people were wounded in the attack at Camp Taji, about 17 miles north of Baghdad, according to the spokesman, Navy Capt. Bill Urban. About 18 Katyusha rockets hit the base, and five of the wounded were evacuated in serious condition, Urban said.
The rockets were launched from the Rashediya area of northeast Baghdad, Iraqi military officials said in a statement. Iraqi forces found a truck rigged with rockets a few miles away from the base, the U.S. military said in a statement.
U.S. officials have attributed the use of such rockets in attacks to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, prompting questions how the United States and its allies might respond.
On Wednesday night, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and an Iraqi militia official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that airstrikes had been carried out after the attack across the Iraqi border around the Syrian city of Abu Kamal. Iranian-backed militias are known to have a presence there.
But the U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq did not disclose carrying out any such strikes. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, did not deny that strikes occurred, but denied that the United States had launched any. It was not clear whether another U.S. ally may have carried them out.
Among the dead at Camp Taji was a British service member, a U.S. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The British ministry of defense acknowledged that it was tracking the incident but did not initially confirm that detail.
""An investigation is underway, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,” the ministry said in a statement.
Iraqi officials disclosed that Camp Taji was attacked about 90 minutes before Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper was set to deliver a speech at the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington. The appearance was abruptly canceled, with a defense official saying that Esper was keeping himself available for meetings about the U.S. response to the spread of coronavirus.
The attack on Wednesday had similarities to one launched on a military base outside Kirkuk on Dec. 27, killing a U.S. contractor, interpreter Nawres Hamid. The United States launched airstrikes in Iraq and Syria two days later against the Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah.
Militia members and supporters responded by storming entrances to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Dec. 31, chanting “Death to America” and setting fires. They eventually withdrew.
On Jan. 3, the United States launched a drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport that killed Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general whose Quds Force supplies arms to Kitaeb Hezbollah and other militias, according to U.S. officials.
That spawned concerns that Iran may retaliate with a larger attack in the region, including potentially at sea. Rockets have been fired at bases in Iraq since then, but no coalition members had been killed."

Trump, speaking Wednesday evening from the Oval Office, said the restrictions, which won’t apply to the U.K., will go into effect Friday at midnight. He blamed the European Union for not curbing travel from China in the early days of the outbreak, and credited his own measures with having limited the number of cases in the U.S.
“The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots,” Trump said. “As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.”
The president in his address laid out a series of fiscal measures to deal with the economic fallout from the rapid spread of a disease he labeled a “foreign virus.” But his remarks -- in which he overstated the scope of the travel restrictions and misspoke that he was also curtailing trade -- were met with a swift plunge in markets.
U.S. stock futures declined as Trump spoke and continued lower overnight. Contracts on the S&P 500 sank as much as 4.9%. Futures on the technology-heavy Nasdaq index dropped as much as 5%, triggering a limit-down level that doesn’t allow them to fall too much in a particular session. Stocks from Europe to Asia posted steep declines, and oil plummeted.
Trump’s Error-Laden ‘Foreign Virus’ Speech Has Investors Spooked
In a statement following Trump’s address, Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf clarified that the administration was suspending the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in any of 26 European nations in the previous two weeks.
And while Trump said that the prohibition on European travel would “not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things,” a White house official subsequently said the restrictions would only apply to people and not goods.
As markets tumbled, Trump offered further clarification in a tweet, saying “please remember, very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.”
The restriction does not apply to legal permanent residents and immediate family members of U.S. citizens. Wolf said U.S. citizens arriving from Europe will travel through specific airports where they can undergo screening for the virus.
Travel Warning
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also raised its travel warning for Europe, advising Americans to avoid nonessential travel to specified countries in the region.
“Travelers returning from the specified countries in Europe must stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing,” the CDC said in a statement on its website.
Two hours after Trump’s address, House Democrats released the text of a bill they said would include free coronavirus testing, paid emergency leave for workers, food security assistance and other measures to help people weather the outbreak.
“We have a public health crisis in this country and the best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a joint statement. “Alarmingly, the president did not say how the administration will address the lack of coronavirus testing kits throughout the United States.”
As Trump spoke, companies and public officials across the country were taking actions to deal with the rapid spread of the virus. The NBA suspended games until further notice, Twitter Inc. directed employees to work from home and governors and mayors restricted large gatherings. The State Department issued a Level 3 health advisory, urging Americans to reconsider travel abroad due to the virus.
‘Temporary Moment’
Following the remarks, the White House announced that Trump was canceling travel to Colorado and Nevada that were scheduled for this week.
The S&P 500 closed Wednesday 19% lower than its February high, with every industry down at least 3.9% on the day.
“This is not a financial crisis,” Trump said. “This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world.”
The World Health Organization earlier Wednesday declared the outbreak is now a pandemic and urged governments to step up containment efforts as the number of worldwide cases topped 123,000 and deaths exceeded 4,500. The virus has spread particularly rapidly in Europe. In Italy, deaths jumped 31% in a single day, rising to 827 on Wednesday.
Trump claimed that his early action to restrict travel from China and other affected countries slowed the spread of the virus in the U.S. He said the administration is “monitoring the situation in China and South Korea,” and that “a possible early opening” could happen if the situation improves.
‘Astonished’
“I’m kind of astonished,” said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The idea that this is going to be a solution, it moves us back into this whole idea that we have an opportunity still to close off transmission to the United States and it ignores the reality that it’s already inside our borders.”
The travel industry was bracing for additional flight restrictions, but had expected them to be limited to Germany and Italy, the countries with the largest outbreaks, said Scott Solombrino, executive director of the Global Business Travel Association.
When Trump announced the ban for all of Europe, except the U.K., “everybody was totally caught off guard,” Solombrino said.
Allies were also trying to gage the impact and said they were blindsided by Trump’s announcement. Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, the heads of the European Union’s main institutions, said in a statement the EU “disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.”
In the U.K., Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer, told BBC Radio on Thursday that British officials still don’t know the details. “But there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend as they normally would and travel but it also effects supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy,” he said.
Sunak also questioned whether flight bans will keep spread of the virus under control. “The advice we’re getting is that there isn’t evidence that things like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infection,” Sunak said.
Trump also called on Congress to take action to deliver paid sick leave to hourly workers who risk their livelihoods if they stay home. House Democrats already have included that among a package of measures set for a vote tomorrow. He also recommended that nursing homes curtail non-medically necessary visits.
The president said he is deferring tax payments for certain individuals and businesses affected by the virus. He said the deferments would provide $200 billion in additional liquidity to the economy.
‘Foreign Virus’
Business and individual taxpayers can already get automatic six-month extensions to file their tax returns, but they have to pay by the April 15 deadline or face interest and penalties on the late payments. Extending the due date is akin to the government extending those taxpayers an interest-free loan for that time.
Trump added that he is instructing the Small Business Administration to provide emergency capital to affected firms. Small businesses in areas covered by a presidential disaster declaration are eligible for federal loans of up to $2 million to provide operating funds until those companies recover. In addition, the coronavirus funding bill enacted earlier this month made small businesses negatively affected by the outbreak eligible for the loans.
Trump called on Congress to pass a payroll tax cut to soften the economic fallout and market plunge, but offered no details on a proposal. Democrats have largely scorned the idea.
“This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history,” Trump said. “I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.”"

The Russian president who first came to power in 2000 has set in motion a plan to reset the constitutional term limits that prevent him from serving beyond 2024 -- allowing him room to remain at the helm potentially for an additional 12 years. These maneuvers could put Putin, 67, on track to become the longest-reigning Russian ruler since Ivan the Terrible.
1. Was this a surprise?
Yes and no. Putin has been maneuvering to stay in power but had repeatedly ruled out repealing presidential term limits (an approach taken by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2018). A surprise series of constitutional amendments in his Jan. 15 state-of-the-nation speech appeared intended to allow a post-presidential Putin to keep control without letting him skirt the ban on serving more than two consecutive terms. Then on March 10, Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space and a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party, made a seemingly scripted appeal to reset the term limits during debates on the amendments in the lower house of parliament. An hour later, Putin made an unscheduled address to the chamber and backed the plan provided Russia’s Constitutional Court -- packed with the four-term president’s nominees -- declared it to be legal. The lower house gave final approval to the constitutional changes including the last-minute addition on March 11.
2. What’s in it for Putin?
Putin’s advisers had floated a number of ideas for months that were aimed at allowing him to maintain his unrivaled authority after the end of his presidency. They included taking expanded powers in another post, such as heading the State Council, an advisory body that Putin established in 2000 and currently leads. Another option was to try to merge Russia and its much smaller neighbor Belarus so that Putin could lead the new unified state and thereby sidestep term limits. The plans were either too difficult to pull off or lacked sufficient guarantees of Putin’s continued supremacy, and some hard-liners lobbied instead for him to stay on as president indefinitely.
3. What about the other constitutional changes?
The amendments were originally billed as a way to devolve some power from the presidency to parliament and the State Council. But many of the substantive changes were stripped from the latest drafts and replaced by populist measures such as a ban on gay marriage and the addition of a reference to God. As long as Putin remains in office, it is hard to imagine an emboldened legislature. What was initially interpreted as an attempt to transition away from a super-presidential state now appears to be an excuse to remove term limits as one of the few constraints on Putin’s power. The biggest changes may be in the Russian government that began almost immediately after Putin’s January speech. His loyal prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, announced the government’s resignation and was replaced hours later by Mikhail Mishustin, the head of the Federal Tax Service.
4. Is Putin President for Life?
Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet ruler Josef Stalin. But until now he seemed to want to avoid emulating autocrats in former Soviet republics of central Asia who rode roughshod over constitutional term limits. After finishing his first two terms in 2008, Putin installed Medvedev as president and served as prime minister for four years, during which time the constitution was amended to extend the presidential term to six years from four. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 and was re-elected with a carefully-choreographed landslide in 2018. The Constitutional Court must now rule on whether Putin is eligible to run again before Russians vote on the constitutional package in an April 22 referendum. Assuming Russia’s tightly controlled political system delivers for the Kremlin, Putin could potentially rule until he is 83, a reign of just over 3 1/2 decades. (Ivan the Terrible ruled from 1547 to 1584).
5. Will Putin’s changes face opposition?
Russia’s stunted opposition submitted a request to stage a 50,000-person protest in central Moscow on March 21, but city authorities quickly announced a ban on meetings of more than 5,000 people, ostensibly as a measure to protect against the spread of coronavirus. Polls show that more than two-thirds of Russians support Putin, even if his popularity has sunk recently to levels last seen before he annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. In his two decades in power, Putin has restored Russia’s swagger as a global power by rebuilding the military, deepening ties with China and reasserting Russian influence in the Middle East. Russia has a budget surplus (at least when oil’s above $42 a barrel), low levels of debt and one of the world’s biggest foreign currency reserves. Putin’s Achilles heel may be that he never tackled corruption. A small clique of his friends from his native St. Petersburg have gained vast fortunes under his rule, and opposition leader Alexey Navalny regularly publishes exposes about the lavish lifestyles of people close to power."
"March 12, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/12/counting-everyone-citizens-non-citizens-2020-census-is-crucial/,The Washington Post,Counting everyone — citizens and non-citizens — in the 2020 census is crucial,"As Census forms goes out to the nation between March 12 and March 20, the focus will be on how people can fill them out online to reduce spread of coronavirus, but we can’t forget the other most notable part of the census questionnaire: a citizenship question will not be on it. The census counts every person living in the country, including unauthorized immigrants and green-card holders. Last June, the Supreme Court narrowly struck down the Trump administration’s years-long effort to include a citizenship question, stating that the administration’s ostensible rationale for the question — to aid in the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act — “seems to have been contrived.”
The discovery of Republican redistricting expert Thomas Hofeller’s files exposed the administration’s real reasoning: to make possible redistricting and reapportionment schemes “advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.” The use of Hofeller’s research by senior Justice and Commerce Department officials (the latter of whom supervise the Census Bureau) demonstrated that the erstwhile citizenship question was designed to enable state governments to exclude noncitizens from population calculations used to apportion state legislative districts.
While it was thwarted for the 2020 census, the Trump administration’s efforts to assist in the malapportionment of state legislatures have only begun. Court battles seeking to exclude all or some noncitizens from future apportionment and redistricting plans continue despite the courtroom defeat of the citizenship question last summer. And President Trump has issued an executive order requiring federal departments to share citizenship data in their possession with the Commerce Department as a means of working around the court’s rejection of a Census citizenship question.
With post-2020 Census redistricting battles and apportionment fights on the horizon, it is useful to explore the little-known yet cautionary tale of citizen-only apportionment schemes in American history. While this past reveals that anti-alien apportionment proposals can be — and have been — defeated, it also warns that if adopted by state governments (and found to be constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court), such policies will likely carry significant weight and prove hard to repeal for years to come.
Frequently tied to other provisions circumscribing the power of marginalized communities in state politics, measures excluding noncitizens from the population for the purposes of apportionment date to the early republic. New York barred noncitizens — alongside free blacks and paupers — from the state’s apportionment basis following its 1821 constitutional convention.
Decades later, Henry Gardner, the anti-Catholic Know Nothing governor of Massachusetts, successfully campaigned for an anti-alien apportionment state constitutional amendment in 1857 during a period of intense anti-Irish nativism. Delegates to California’s 1878-1879 constitutional convention forbade “aliens ineligible to citizenship” (namely East and South Asian immigrants) from the state’s apportionment basis at an assembly dominated by the violently racist anti-Chinese Workingmen’s Party. And Nebraska excluded noncitizens from state legislative apportionment calculations amid a flurry of anti-German legislation, constitutional revision and vigilantism during and immediately after World War I.
Anti-alien schemes reached their nadir when the U.S. House of Representatives was not reapportioned — at all — following the 1920 Census. Throughout the 1920s, a powerful bipartisan nativist faction of lawmakers representing — or allied to — regions set to lose seats in the House of Representatives flagrantly flouted their constitutional obligation to reapportion the House every 10 years. That same faction further demanded the passage of legislation to exclude noncitizens from future rounds of reapportionment despite the constitution’s requirement to base congressional reapportionment on the total population residing in the United States.
Then, as now, proponents of citizen-only proposals frequently argued that including noncitizens in apportionment calculations unfairly reduced the power of voters in (usually rural) jurisdictions with large citizen populations in relation to (often urban) communities with large noncitizen populations. Opponents of these measures, by contrast, charged that anti-alien policies amounted to “taxation without representation” and defended noncitizens as law-abiding “constituents.” But these were not the only terms of debate.
Supporters of anti-alien apportionment plans frequently embraced anti-urban and xenophobic rhetoric. New Hampshire politician Henry Metcalf argued that urban centers, composed “largely of alien population, who have no interests in common with the average intelligent New Hampshire voter,” were “not entitled to the same consideration as” residents of “little country towns” at the state’s World War I-era constitutional convention. And, according to a 1920s New York Times article, a woman identified as “Mrs. E.M. Dickinson,” treasurer of the New York State Women’s Republican Club, supported a nationwide citizen-only congressional apportionment basis, citing a highly inaccurate belief that “crime could be traced in most instances to alien criminals.”
Supporters of including noncitizens in apportionment policies fiercely contested — and sometimes defeated — the nativism espoused by Metcalf and Dickinson. New Hampshire voters did not ratify a citizen-only apportionment policy following the First World War. And the decade-long nativist attempt to ban noncitizens from the federal House of Representatives apportionment basis was finally defeated in 1929. When Congress was reapportioned following the 1930 Census, noncitizens were included in those calculations.
When they were adopted, however, anti-alien apportionment provisions usually proved powerful and durable. New York’s citizen-only policy, coupled with the explicit overrepresentation of rural counties and the state’s failure to reapportion the legislature on a regular basis, grossly inflated the number of legislative seats assigned to upstate (largely native-born and Republican) communities vis-a-vis New York City’s (largely immigrant and second-generation Democratic) districts. While Democrats frequently won statewide elections — sometimes by huge margins — in the early to mid-20th century, these malapportionment schemes ensured that Democrats would control both chambers of the state legislature for only a mere one year (1935) between 1913 and 1965.
Citizen-only apportionment policies also proved to be a massive challenge to enforce. Whether states used federal Census citizenship information or ran their own enumerations to identify noncitizens, data limitations led to repeated difficulties in implementation and accusations of inaccurate reapportionment calculations. Yet, despite these challenges, anti-alien apportionment measures proved stubbornly resistant to repeal efforts. The state constitutions of New York and Massachusetts retained their 19th-century citizen-only apportionment provisions until 1969 and 1970, respectively.
Though a citizenship question will not be included on the 2020 Census, the Trump administration’s attempts to enable new anti-alien apportionment measures are far from over. At this moment, it continues to amass citizenship data via alternative administrative records. Meanwhile, some Republican state legislators gearing up for redistricting and reapportionment battles — encouraged by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council — are considering using this data to craft citizen-only apportionment schemes for their own state houses.
Were a state-level citizen-only apportionment proposal to come into force, it would undoubtedly be challenged in court. Voting rights and immigrant rights advocates have a plethora of evidence to demonstrate the harm such a policy would impose on racially marginalized communities and the would-be provisions’ violations of the (federal) constitution. But lawmakers and advocates who support including all residents in apportionment calculations — as community members and as taxpayers — should not assume that this Supreme Court will strike down a new anti-alien policy that may arise in the future.
History teaches us that proposed anti-alien apportionment plans can be defeated. It also indicates that, once adopted, such provisions are likely to become embedded into the politics and constitutions of those states. As in earlier eras of American history, such policies threaten to exacerbate inequalities in representation not only during the 2020s, but for decades to come."
"March 12, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/12/why-isnt-us-ready-pandemic-politicians-investing-prevention-doesnt-pay-off/,The Washington Post,"Why isn’t the U.S. ready for a pandemic? For politicians, investing in prevention doesn’t pay off.","The federal government has been criticized for bungling its plan to adequately prepare for the spread of the new coronavirus. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been unable to roll out mass-scale testing needed to contain the virus and understand its spread. By contrast, South Korea has been able to test hundreds of thousands of people and to begin to curtail the increasing death rate.
Some observers are blaming the lack of investment in public health infrastructure including the limited number of hospital beds, masks and medical devices. Further, the global health security team within the National Security Council was disbanded in 2018. However, this isn’t just a result of the Trump administration’s decisions. According to the Trust for America’s Health, the country’s lack of investment in public health stretches far back in history.
So why is the United States so poorly equipped for a mass pandemic? Much of the answer plausibly lies in politicians’ incentives. Having the federal government prepare for crises may be incredibly good value for money. But politicians get few or no benefits from doing so, since voters don’t reward them for being ready. This is why.
Preventive spending is very effective
In 2009, Andrew Healy and I published a paper in the American Political Science Review analyzing how voters responded to federal spending on preparing for and responding to natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes. We collected data on county-level presidential election results, disaster damage and spending.
We found spending money on prevention is highly effective at mitigating future disasters. Benjamin Franklin famously said “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” — suggesting a 1-to-16 relationship between the costs of prevention and the costs of cure. That’s only a very slight exaggeration. We estimate that $1 spent on preparedness is worth about $15 in terms of the future damage it mitigates. We also looked at response spending, which usually comes in the form of checks sent to disaster victims. Unsurprisingly, that does not reduce future disaster damage.
But prevention doesn’t benefit politicians
Despite the clear efficiency of investing in preparation rather than response, prevention spending has decreased over the decades — while response spending has increased. Why has the federal government spent its money so poorly?
The answer lies in electoral incentives. We find that presidents who deliver relief spending after a disaster get a larger share of the votes in the next election. Specifically, if the incumbent party increases relief expenditures in a county from $1 per person (the 66th percentile for spending in the data) to $10 per person (the 93rd percentile in the data), the incumbent party will gain about 0.77 percentage points more in the next presidential vote. But there is a flat relationship between prevention spending in a county and presidential vote share — in other words, there’s no increase at all. This creates a clear incentive for government to not invest much in prevention, and instead to send help when disaster strikes.
Why do voters behave like this? Although we don’t have direct evidence, we offer numerous theories in the paper. For instance, voters may not be aware of preparation spending, or may not think it should affect their votes. Voters might also be shortsighted and discount the future. Perhaps voters prefer to receive individual benefits like checks in the mail rather than collective, shared public goods like prevention. Or maybe the problem lies in who gets the credit. Why would a politician spend money on preparation today if a future politician will reap the electoral rewards later on when a disaster occurs and the media celebrates those preparations?
This has consequences for covid-19
Of course, there’s always an electoral risk of a massive failure such as Hurricane Katrina or a viral pandemic. But often, politicians’ most attractive strategy will be to kick the can down the road. That’s true not just for singular disaster events, but also for systemic problems such as climate change and underfunded pensions.
It is possible, at least in theory, that after horrific disasters, voters might start to reward politicians for investing in prevention. However, in the past, voters had notably short attention spans. Immediately after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which devastated New Orleans, there were many proposals to shore up infrastructure and prepare for climate change. According to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, in late 2006, 30 percent of New Orleans residents said “repairing the levees, pumps, and flood walls” should be one of the top two priorities in the rebuilding efforts, ranking this item and crime control as their top two concerns. But once the event disappeared from the media cycle, the public’s desire for preparedness expenditure dissipated. The Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed New Orleans residents again in 2008. Only 2 percent of New Orleans residents ranked “hurricane protection/rebuilding flood walls, levees” as a top concern."
"March 12, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/12/how-trumps-refusal-admit-mistakes-may-have-exacerbated-europes-frustrations/,The Washington Post,How Trump’s refusal to admit mistakes may have exacerbated Europe’s frustrations,"One of the less-commented-upon mistakes that President Trump made in his speech about the coronavirus Wednesday night was a bit of a verbal stumble.
“This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history,” Trump said near the outset of his remarks. “I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.”
You would be forgiven for not knowing what “counting” to take tough measures means. Why would that phrase have been included in Trump’s speech when “continuing to take tough measures” by itself gets the point across?
The answer, as experienced observers of the president are aware, is that “counting” wasn’t included in Trump’s speech. This is an example of the coping mechanism Trump deploys, gliding past verbal stumbles by simply pretending that he meant to include the incorrect word in what he was saying, even if it doesn’t make any sense. He meant to say “continuing to take tough measures,” and instead said “counting” — then simply rewound himself with a cursory “and.”
In late 2017, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes documented several examples of Trump deploying this tactic.
Sometimes, the rewinds are much more substantive than simply tossing in one odd word. CNN’s Daniel Dale, who fact-checks Trump’s speeches for the network, noticed a lengthy aside apparently spurred by misreading the teleprompter during the president’s speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.
Trump’s prepared remarks almost certainly had him saying, “We understand that our first duty and our highest loyalty is to the American citizens,” continuing on to attack his political opponents for violating “this sacrosanct principle.” But perhaps having gone on a riff about first lady Melania Trump earlier in his speech, that’s not what he said.
“We understand that our first lady and highest — ” he said, catching himself and redirecting, “and you have to remember this: When our first lady came out, she said to me today, ‘Say hello to everybody.’ And she said that ‘your first duty and your highest loyalty’ — and this was coming right from her — ‘is to the American citizens. And you really have to let the people know.’ This is — Melania told me this. Can you believe this?”
The crowd applauded.
“She’s like giving me a history lesson. Our first lady is giving me a history” — more applause — “Our highest loyalty to the American people. I said, ‘Okay.’ That was pretty good. Thank you. Thank you very much. I’ll tell her. I’ll tell her that was the single-best line in the whole speech.”
He went on to disparage the “American left.”
It’s not entirely clear what motivates Trump to defend his mistakes in this way. Slate’s Ashley Feinberg has speculated it may be a function of his disinclination to wear reading glasses. Normally, though, such slip-ups don’t really matter, and the cause for them is relatively unimportant.
At another point in his speech Wednesday evening, though, Trump may have had a more significant slip-up.
He’d announced a ban on travel from Europe to the United States.
“There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings,” Trump said, “and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.”
This wasn’t actually right. The administration wasn’t announcing a ban on cargo or trade. Dale speculates that perhaps Trump had seen “not apply to” on the teleprompter, read it as “not only apply to” and then had to append the “various other things” to justify the use of “not only.” That theory is bolstered by the inclusion of “tremendous.” Trump’s speech was heavy on reminders of the health of the economy; pointedly exempting the “tremendous” amount of trade with the European Union would send a signal that Trump was keeping economic concerns at the forefront.
Later reporting indicated European leaders had not been informed about the new restrictions before Trump announced them on live television. During the 10-minute window between his comments and the White House’s clarification about their scope, imagine the scramble from European trade partners: a ban on any trade or cargo? The implications of Trump’s statement were probably short-lived but not insignificant.
Perhaps something changed between the moment when Trump read his remarks and the later walk-back from his White House. Perhaps Trump had intended to curtail all trade, though, of course, people are the most worrisome vector for transmitting the virus.
And perhaps Trump wanted America to know that his team was counting to take tough measures."

Bernie Sanders plans to intensify its fundraising and organizing efforts against the Democratic establishment, which is coalescing around former vice president Joe Biden after recent presidential primary wins.
The sprawling network of socialists, climate-change activists, millennial organizers and other liberal advocates, who raise money from millions of members and have knocked on many doors in support of Sanders (I-Vt.), say they plan to cite the coronavirus outbreak and the uncertain economy to advance him as the only candidate who can enact broad economic and environmental change.
Their efforts come even as major Democratic super PACs line up to spend millions for Biden as the candidate they consider best positioned to win the party’s nomination.
Sanders, a prolific fundraiser in his own right among donors giving in smaller amounts, defied expectations to win early nominating contests before falling behind in delegates in recent weeks.
“It really looked like Bernie Sanders was winning, and now we’re back into something that’s a little more familiar: being the underdog,” said Alan Minsky, executive director of Progressive Democrats of America, one of the groups in the People Power for Bernie coalition. “The progressive left has not come this close to winning in America in my lifetime.”
Since Super Tuesday on March 3, the landscape of independent groups supporting the two candidates has changed significantly.
On Biden’s side, many of the party's wealthiest donors have embraced his candidacy after sitting on the sidelines or previously supporting other moderates in the primary. They are directing donations to the campaign and to the super PACs that raise and spend unlimited amounts to boost his chances.
These donors — including financier Donald Sussman, one of the party’s most generous givers, and billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who dropped out of the race — are newly supporting Biden and giving at an overwhelming clip, according to donors and fundraisers.
“I’ve never experienced anything like it,” said Alan Kessler, a longtime Biden donor and fundraiser, of the onslaught of donor interest. Fundraising for Biden “was a really tough slog two weeks ago. It’s not tough now.”
Meanwhile, People Power for Bernie said it is prepared for the long haul for the democratic socialist, who still has a narrow path to victory.
Among those in the coalition are activists working to elect socialists to city councils; housing advocates who want every person in the country to have access to affordable housing; youth activists rallying around combating climate change; protesters who camped outside the Florida governor’s office in the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death; and undocumented immigrants pushing for immigrant rights.
These groups have held events nationwide promoting Sanders, have filmed viral videos attacking moderate Democrats and have knocked on countless doors on behalf of Sanders. They are sharing talking points on Google Docs and stocking up on print fliers and snacks for door-knocking as they try to mobilize younger and minority voters for Sanders in upcoming contests.
Some activists are less optimistic. At least one group, the Center for Popular Democracy, said that it will remain supportive of Sanders’s campaign message but that it is shifting national messaging to be more focused on progressive values because it is “realistic about the challenges in the road ahead.”
“We always understood that the establishment was never going to be okay with someone as radical and progressive as Sen. Sanders to be the heir apparent to the Democratic nomination for president,” said Natalia Salgado, political director of Center for Popular Democracy.
In all, at least 16 groups unconnected to the campaign have spent money to promote Sanders by running ads and holding get-out-the-vote campaigns. These groups include the nine organizations in People Power for Bernie.
Although some of the groups in the coalition are newly formed and have little paper trail, others have existed for a few years and have cash to spend.
For instance, the Center for Popular Democracy had about $22.6 million in 2017, according to the group’s latest tax filing. People’s Action, a nonprofit organization, received $7 million in grants in 2017.
It is unknown how much most of these groups have raised to support Sanders in the 2020 cycle or where they are getting their money because they are not required to disclose their donor lists. Advocates for more transparency in political donations — predominantly on the left — refer to this type of funding as “dark money.”
The groups reject that label, saying they have internal measures to vet the sources of their donations so that they are not taking money from billionaires or special interests that would undermine their mission. They said they are respecting their donors’ desire to remain private.
“Being an openly socialist organization, for us, it feels very important to protect the privacy of our members while also making it very clear that we don’t accept corporate funding,” said Sean Estelle, one of the leaders of the Democratic Socialists of America’s national campaign to support Sanders.
On Biden’s side are some of the most well-funded super PAC operations, whose donors are made public. These groups have spent more than $9.8 million to support Biden, mainly through Unite the Country, a super PAC started by Biden’s allies.
Bloomberg, who dropped out of the presidential race after Super Tuesday, is starting a group to run independent expenditures to support Biden. On Wednesday, Bloomberg’s campaign published copies of its anti-Trump ads for public use — worth $275 million in ad spending — as the campaign shifts the billionaire’s resources to help defeat President Trump in November.
Priorities USA Action, the main pro-Democratic super PAC, is shifting its advertising messaging to defend Biden — a sign that the establishment considers him the likely nominee.
American Bridge, another major Democratic super PAC, on Wednesday also shifted its general-election messaging to support Biden. It began running $2.2  million in ads in Pennsylvania, aimed at boosting Biden through television, radio and digital ads.
“The voices of Democratic voters are loud and clear: they want Joe Biden to be our standard-bearer,” American Bridge President Bradley Beychok said in a statement. “That’s why we are rallying behind his candidacy and will deploy every resource at our disposal from now until November to ensure Joe Biden is the next President of the United States.”"

Trump said Wednesday in an address from the Oval Office that he’s seeking cuts to payroll taxes by an unspecified amount, $50 billion in low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration, deferrals of income-tax payments for some and unspecified relief for workers forced to stay home for virus-related reasons. He also announced a one-month ban on most travel from Europe to the U.S. -- excluding the U.K. -- which is aimed at stemming the virus’s spread though that will further deepen the travel industry’s woes.
The series of proposed measures didn’t go far enough to bolster confidence or the markets in the hours after the speech, though some saw it as a good first step.
“The president’s proposals fall well short of what will be needed to avoid an economic downturn,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody’s Analytics. “And on net, the proposals he put forward today are probably a wash at best. You have the benefit of some of the tax proposals washed out by the negative of the travel ban with Europe.”
Futures on the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks steadily deteriorated as details of Trump’s plan leaked out over the dinnertime hours. Down about 0.8% when his speech began, the loss extended to 2% by the time the president finished speaking, and reached more than 4% later.
Trump caused confusion by appearing to say that the European travel ban would also apply to imported cargo -- a move that would cause huge disruption to trade and supply chains -- before Trump clarified in a tweet that the ban wouldn’t apply to goods.
Imposing a travel restriction of Europeans entering the U.S. is likely to throw business travel and tourism into disarray, and also force many airliners and hotels to offer further refunds or credits for canceled trips, as many have done so far.
“It’s a pretty aggressive and appropriate set of policy proposals,” though the question is would it be approved by Congress, said Mickey Levy, Berenberg’s chief economist for the Americas and Asia. “It all depends on how long this virus lasts and how much it disrupts business.”
Quantifying the impact on growth from the president’s proposals as outlined Wednesday is likely tricky because of the lack of details and uncertainty over negotiations with Congress.
“I think that small business loans and tax holiday for impacted industries are very important,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager with Federated Investors. “The key thing now is that we have clear momentum towards a fiscal response.”
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin estimated at a House hearing Wednesday that delaying the tax-filing deadline would inject about $200 billion of liquidity into the economy. Business and individual taxpayers can already get automatic six-month extensions to file their tax returns, but they have to pay by the April 15 deadline or face interest and penalties on the late payments. Extending the due date is akin of the government extending those taxpayers an interest-free loan for three months.
Trump has also repeatedly mentioned his desire for a payroll tax cut to soften the economic fallout and market plunge. One of the president’s top advisers said they may propose suspending the payroll tax entirely -- a costly move, since the Congressional Budget Office estimates payroll taxes would bring in $1.3 trillion over the 2020 fiscal year."

Now He Owns the Collapse,"It was always dumb for Donald Trump to take credit for the stock market, and put rising share prices at the center of his case for re-election. That should have been clear from the outset, and is beyond doubt now that U.S. stocks have sunk into a bear market only months before he must face voters.
The stock market and a president’s chances of re-election aren’t necessarily linked. But Trump’s fate is now inextricably tied to the market’s, and both are prone to the pandemic virus. As he confronts what will probably be the toughest stretch of his political career to date, he might be well advised to take stocks as a good monitor of his performance. Unless he can somehow deliver a successful response to both the human and economic effects of the coronavirus, a protracted bear market is likely. And if the market deeply dislikes measures to deal with the virus, that might conceivably be good reason to change course.
Over the past year, the link between the market and Trump’s perceived chance of re-election (which can be most easily gauged by prediction markets) is startlingly close. Stock markets tend to reflect the prevailing mood in society, so this isn’t greatly surprising, and Trump is regarded as far more market-friendly than several of his potential Democratic rivals. Over the past year, stocks rose with the growing chance of a Trump victory, as expressed by prices on the Predictit market — and in the last two weeks they have tumbled together. The Democrats are now thought slightly more likely to win:
This shows the folly of taking credit for the rally. The president cannot control the market — indeed, others have far greater influence over it. Moreover, he took office at a time when stocks were already very expensive. That made it highly unlikely that the stock market would perform well for him. Even when stocks were at their peak three years ago, the performance on his watch was nothing special. 
This chart shows the S&P 500 from inauguration day until Wednesday’s close, in white, and compares it with the equivalent period for the first terms of the nine other presidents to be elected since the war. (I excluded Johnson and Ford, who took over as vice presidents). Trump is in white.  
As that chart looks like spaghetti, here are the returns in simple bar chart form. The blue columns show performance from inauguration day through March 11, while the white columns show performance to Feb. 19, still not even a month ago, when the S&P 500 Index made its last all-time high. At that point, Trump was roughly level with Bill Clinton and lagged only Eisenhower and Obama, both of whom took office near the bottom of major bear markets. After the sell-off , Trump has now dropped in the rankings behind the first President Bush, and JFK :
If this swift reversal of fortune doesn’t reveal the foolishness of measuring yourself by the stock market, note further that Trump still has better returns than the two Republican presidents he would most like to emulate. Presidents Reagan and Nixon both won re-election in a landslide, and both oversaw thoroughly anemic stock-market returns early in their fourth year. George W. Bush, the only president sitting on a decline in March of his fourth year (having taken office just as a speculative bubble was bursting), also won a second term.
The fact that three conservative presidents prevailed in their re-election bids despite poor stock-market performance shows that politicians shouldn’t target share prices. They aren’t, in themselves, that relevant to voters. But now that Trump has taken credit for the gains, he will find it difficult to avoid political responsibility for losses.
There is a decent chance that the market will rebound strongly into the election — that is exactly what a number of major Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., are currently predicting. The argument is that after the twin shocks of the virus and falling oil prices cause a profits recession in the first half, a natural rebound in earnings as life returns to normal will allow stocks swiftly to settle into a new bull market.
That scenario isn’t far-fetched, but it is hampered by the very high valuations that Trump inherited, and that have grown even higher under his presidency. Sparking a pre-election stock market revival will require a strong response to the human effects of the virus, in addition to well-targeted financial measures to prevent the twin shocks from metastasizing into a credit crisis. The American corporate sector is heavily leveraged, and credit investors are already signaling concern about the risks of bankruptcies and forced sales.
This will be difficult. The countries to have the best success in controlling the virus to date, Hong Kong and Singapore, are both cities with relatively authoritarian governments. It will be hard to copy their methods in the far larger and more democratic U.S.
When it comes to stimulating the economy, the American system of checks and balances could again put Trump at a disadvantage. The U.K. this week announced in quick succession an emergency 50-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of England, and the biggest fiscal expansion in almost three decades. That was well received by the markets.
But the U.K. has a newly elected prime minister with five years left of his mandate, and a strong majority in parliament. Policy is virtually a matter of deciding what to do and then doing it, untroubled by the opposition. Coordination is far harder in the euro zone. The European Central Bank has less freedom of movement and fiscal policy must be coordinated by a patchwork of finance ministers across the continent.
If Trump wants to spark a renewed bull market before the election, he will need to negotiate a complicated stimulus package with a House of Representatives controlled by Democrats desperate to ensure his defeat — but also desperate not to seem obstructionist. He also needs to come up with exactly the right measures to avert credit problems — a feat that proved mighty difficult in 2008.
If he can pull this off, the president should win both a V-shaped stock-market recovery and his own re-election. But he would have been better off if he had never drawn attention to the stock market in the first place."

BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vt.) has decided to keep running for the Democratic presidential nomination, at least through Sunday’s one-on-one debate with former vice president Joe Biden. That means we can probably expect to hear more from Mr. Sanders about how wrong it was of Mr. Biden to vote, as a senator, for the 2008 bill establishing the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) — a.k.a., the Wall Street bailout. “Joe bailed out the crooks on Wall Street that nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago,” Sanders said in a recent Fox News town hall. “These guys, after destroying the economy, they came to Congress . . . and said ‘bail us out.’ ” The democratic socialist launched similar attacks on his 2016 rival for the nomination, Hillary Clinton.
As they say in Brooklyn — enough, already. The truth is that support for TARP should be considered a basic demonstration of political maturity and pragmatism, not some sort of betrayal of the working class. The TARP vote reflects well on Mr. Biden, and poorly on Mr. Sanders, who joined with 24 other senators from the left wing of the Democratic Party and the far right of the Republican Party in opposition.
Some relevant historical context: The outgoing Bush administration and the Democrats who controlled both houses of Congress had few good options for dealing with a once-in-a-century global financial collapse. As experts from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department told the politicians, however, one sure way to turn the worst recession since the Great Depression into, well, another Great Depression, would have been to let the banking sector collapse and take millions of American households down with it. No doubt Wall Street irresponsibility played a big part in creating the crisis, as Mr. Sanders says, but the appropriate way to deal with that was to fix regulations — not to make a punitive point at the expense of Main Street.
The Obama administration inherited TARP and wisely administered it so that both banking and the auto industry were able to come back. Both of these economic pillars are much better positioned financially to withstand a major shock than they were in 2008, which is why, amid much discussion about the possible need to rescue various industries from the impact of the coronavirus, no one has yet mentioned Wall Street or Detroit. TARP ended up using $426.4 billion of its available $700 billion to take equity in banks, a major insurer and two of the Big Three automakers, as well as to extend various loans. By the end of 2014, it had recovered $441.7 billion — a small profit which, even if not adjusted for inflation or uncompensated credit risks, still looks like a pretty good deal for taxpayers, compared to the costs of doing nothing.
Mr. Sanders is within his rights to continue seeking the nomination. But it is long past time for him to quit his campaign of vilification against Mr. Biden for what was actually a major policy success."
"March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/12/why-sanders-should-keep-fighting/,The Washington Post,Why Sanders should keep fighting,"Just a few weeks ago, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was being declared almost unstoppable. Now, the label appears more appropriately applied to former vice president Joe Biden. The Democratic primary isn’t over, but the path to a Sanders victory is narrow.
So should Sanders give up and go home? No, he needs to keep up the fight.
Sanders has never been running just to win. He’s also running to drag the Democratic Party to the left, to forcefully confront the party establishment about its failures to address working people’s issues, and to raise people’s awareness about the possibilities for progressive social change. Staying in the race allows him to continue doing these things and more.
Even though Sanders lost back in 2016, in an important way he still won. The party realized that Sanders voters represented a substantial portion of the electorate, and because Hillary Clinton needed their support in November, Clinton’s wing of the party was forced to the negotiating table. As Jeff Stein noted in Vox, Sanders “won a string of concessions on the Democratic Party platform, pulling the party to the left on the minimum wage, environmental regulation, marijuana legalization, and the war on drugs.” The party’s official platform changed directly as a result of Sanders’s success, with once-radical policies such as a $15 minimum wage becoming part of the Democratic agenda.
In 2020, Sanders might be able to do the same with his signature policy, Medicare-for-all. Even in states that Sanders has been losing badly, single-payer health insurance has been popular among the majority of Democratic voters — thanks in part to Sanders’s years-long effort to build support for overhauling the insurance industry. The coronavirus crisis has exposed the catastrophic failings of the U.S. health-care system and the social safety net. Staying in the race gives Sanders the opportunity to explain how progressive social policy can mitigate these disasters.
In 2016, Sanders succeeded at bringing the Democratic Party around on crucial issues because he posed a threat to those who hold power within it. The more strength Sanders and his supporters show at the polls in 2020, the less tenable a moderate Democratic position will be. After all, if Biden is to have any hope of beating President Trump in November, he will need to get Sanders’s voters to support him — and that’s not going to be easy. A show of strength from the Sanders base of young progressives and independents could push Biden to make serious concessions: commit to passing signature progressive policies such as Medicare-for-all, a Green New Deal, free universal college tuition, and paid family and sick leave.
Critics say Sanders staying in the race will weaken Biden in a general election, and that Democrats need to unify immediately against Trump. But the more Sanders can put pressure on Biden to accommodate progressives, the more “unity” will ultimately be achieved. We all want to beat Trump. But if Sanders supporters are left bitter because Biden disregards their agenda, they are unlikely to pull together to “vote blue no matter who.”
This is another reason to stay in the fight. Sanders needs to amass as many votes as possible to make clear the number of people who might stay home in November unless the Democratic Party shows it cares about them. If voters simply line up behind Biden in the remaining states, there will be no reason for Biden to endorse progressive policies. And all voters deserve a choice: It shouldn’t just be those in early states who have the option of stating their desire for a social democratic agenda. Everyone deserves a chance to weigh in, which they won’t get if Sanders quits and leaves the race.
But finally, and most importantly, Sanders should stay in as much for principle as for pragmatism. He needs to keep fighting as long as he can because others have fought for him as long as they could.
There was Al Johnson, who made hundreds of calls for Sanders while dying in his hospital bed, and there is James Williams, who spends “every breath I have left” working for Sanders, because he wants to make sure others have the kind of low-cost, high-quality health care that he himself never had. Millions of people have devoted themselves to Bernie because they feel seen by him in a way they have never felt seen by a politician before. They have put their faith in him, and he has made them believe that a better and fairer world is possible. He would be letting them down if he didn’t keep up that fight until the end."
"March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/bernie-sanders-and-joe-biden-can-unite-democrats/2020/03/12/e06b1036-63eb-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html,The Washington Post,Sanders and Biden need each other. Here’s how they can make peace.,"Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders do not want it on their consciences that they helped reelect President Trump. The future of the country really does depend on how both of them act over the next few weeks.
They should realize four things. First, if they don’t work together, and fast, Trump really could win reelection. If the urgency of putting an end to a genuinely dangerous presidency was not clear before his bungling of the coronavirus crisis, it should be now. Second, they need each other to achieve their respective core goals, both in the short term and in the long run. Third, there is a history of the left working with a governing center to achieve substantial social reform. Finally, neither of them has a monopoly on wisdom. Each must pay attention to the other’s central concerns.
What will be asked of them is not easy: Sanders has to acknowledge, quickly, that there is no way he is going to win the Democratic nomination he has spent five years fighting for. Biden has to reach out to a candidate who has regularly attacked him as a tool of the establishment and to a constituency of young voters who think he’s over the hill.
If they can’t do all these things, they will strengthen Trump in November. The difficult truth is staring them in the face: They need each other to win.
Democrats showed in 2018 the good things that can happen when their progressive and moderate wings work together. The party grabbed control of the House with a popular-vote majority of nearly 10 million. That’s enough to retake the White House.
If the vote for president matched the popular vote for House candidates in every state, according to calculations by my Brookings Institution colleague William Frey, the Democratic nominee would get 293 electoral votes. That means victory, but it’s only 23 more than the 270 required to win the presidency, which is not much of a cushion. Biden thus badly needs the constituencies Sanders has mobilized, particularly Americans under 35. Biden will be sunk if they vote for third-party candidates or stay home.
In 2018, progressives realized they had an interest in victories by many politicians around the country with more moderate views than their own. Moderates, in turn, grasped the turnout and activism that progressives could provide. Both sides also understood that it’s foolish to argue about whether elections depend solely on either mobilizing voters or persuading them. If all the wings of the Democratic Party don’t mobilize, Biden will lose. But especially in swing states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona are at the top of the list — Biden will also lose if he doesn’t persuade at least some of Trump’s 2016 voters to switch sides and many moderate independents and Republicans to come his way.
This is why Biden needs Sanders, but also why Sanders needs to give Biden some room to do what he needs to do to win. Accepting defeat might make Sanders grumpy, but he can move forward with pride — and that is what he seemed to do when he signaled a de-escalation of the campaign Wednesday. He acknowledged he was “losing” but said his forces had “won the ideological debate.”
He was onto something. He has fundamentally altered the nature of the conversation in the Democratic Party. Together, he and Elizabeth Warren have moved even the most moderate Democrats to the left. His proposals for Medicare-for-all, free college and bold action on climate change, and his warnings about the dangers of concentrated corporate power, set the terms of this year’s debate. Candidates were judged by how close or far they were from his core objectives. That’s a big deal.
Moreover, Sanders’s movement is now a permanent force in the Democratic Party, much like organized labor was in the old days, or the religious right is now in the GOP. Democrats will not be able to ignore the left wing that Sanders has brought to life. He made democratic socialism a popular idea among young Americans. Unlike their elders, they associate socialism not with the Soviet Union but with a decent, democratic society that pays attention to the needs of the powerless, the marginalized and the working class. A 2018 survey showed that 58 percent of adults under 30 identified socialism as a system that “provides citizens with health insurance, retirement support, and access to free higher education”; only 38 percent saw it as government control of “key parts of the economy, such as utilities, transportation and communications industries.”
But for all his achievements, it’s clear now that Sanders speaks for only about a third of Democrats. (So far, he has received just over 30 percent of the popular vote in the Democratic primaries.) His task is to accept his role as a source of pressure for far-reaching reform inside the Democratic coalition.
There’s a role model for him: Sidney Hillman, the strategic mastermind of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the left wing of the labor movement of the 1930s and 1940s. The CIO gave critical support to Franklin D. Roosevelt when he needed it against the party’s right wing, but it also pushed FDR in a more progressive direction.
Sanders and his movement should embrace the idea that they need a sympathetic moderate liberal — his name now is Joe Biden — in power to achieve anything they have in mind. They have a right to ask Biden for some reassurances, but they should not waste a lot of time on foolish platform fights or demands for symbolic gestures. What matters is the policy agenda Biden pursues after he is elected.
The good news for Biden is that there are many issues on which outreach to Sanders’s supporters could also help the likely Democratic nominee with the broader electorate, too. A commitment to increasing the power of workers in an economy that has seen unions weaken sits well with both Sanders’s objectives and Biden’s Scranton, Pa., working-class roots. More vocal and aggressive moves on climate change would help reassure younger voters. Strong pledges to limit the power of big money in politics would reinforce the message House Democrats sent with their comprehensive elections and ethics bill, H.R. 1. Biden could also take some steps closer to Sanders on universal access to public universities and job training. And while Biden would be ill-advised to change his position on health care, he could shift from bashing Medicare-for-all to giving Sanders credit for moving the broader health-care argument in a more progressive direction.
Finally, Biden’s pledge to work with Republicans is too central to his persona for him to abandon it. But he needs to do far more to show that he recognizes the growing power of right-wing radicalism in the GOP and its habit of obstructionism.
More broadly, Biden needs to make very clear that he accepts the Sanders movement’s critique of Democratic politicians who gave in too readily to the right-wing political consensus that Ronald Reagan established after 1980. Democrats have spent too much time negotiating with themselves and offering preemptive concessions that rarely won them Republican support. They built the Affordable Care Act around Republican ideas, made one change after another at the GOP’s request — and won not a single Republican vote on final passage. When they are in power, Democrats are terribly sensitive to Republican criticisms of deficit spending, and they work to bring budgets under control; then they look on when Republicans win power and let the red ink flow freely to finance tax cuts for their wealthy supporters. Sanders’s backers are understandably tired of Democrats always looking over their right shoulders.
Biden also should reject the premise of another foolish argument: that Democrats must choose between restoration or transformation as the core goal of the next four years. Plainly, the country needs both. Restoring the norms and values that Trump has ripped apart is a precondition of progress. But that’s the point: What voters seek to restore is progress.
The next president needs to be mindful that Trump’s election was a sign of how much transformation the country needs. The growing economic inequalities of the past 40 years — with their racial, regional and individual components — helped Trump win and made it easier for him to divide the country into warring factions.
And here is what Biden and Sanders should acknowledge together: Democrats are a far more progressive party today than they were even in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected president. This is true both because of pressure from the inside — from Sanders and Warren, and from new left-of-center voices such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) — and because nearly everyone has a less sanguine view of unregulated capitalism since the great crash of 2008.
Polling in the past few weeks suggests that 80 percent or more of Sanders’s supporters are already inclined to vote for Biden over Trump. If Biden reaches out, as he should, Sanders should reciprocate by dissociating himself more forcefully than he has from the most toxic among the Bernie Bros — even though he also has a right to remind Democrats that the vast majority of his backers are idealistic partisans for social justice who don’t spend their lives on Twitter. One Sanders organizer asked me in Iowa in January: “Why do the media judge us by the loudest of our supporters rather than the kindest of our supporters?” Sanders should also stop claiming that Biden’s victory was a product of dastardly moves by “the Democratic establishment.” In fact, Biden’s victory was built on a foundation of African American votes in South Carolina and elsewhere, and on the intense desire of millions of middle-class Democrats to beat Trump.
It takes a coalition to save a country, and coalitions are hard. They succeed when their members focus on what they share rather than what pulls them apart. Starting with Sunday’s debate, Biden and Sanders have to begin a process of reconciliation that will send a message to their respective supporters, and the rest of the nation, that change begins with getting Trump out of office — but it won’t end there.
Two men in their late 70s should be especially mindful of how history will judge them. If they get this wrong, nothing else they have done will matter."
"March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/china-knows-a-thing-or-two-about-trader-tantrums/2020/03/13/508eb962-64e1-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html,The Washington Post,China Knows a Thing or Two About Trader Tantrums,"Quantitative easing, fiscal stimulus. Despite the billions of dollars promised, it seems global financial markets can’t stop sliding. Meanwhile China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, has remained an ocean of relative calm. How has Beijing managed to pull this off?
Christine Lagarde, for one, must be desperate to know. The European Central Bank president got a taste of traders’ impossible expectations Thursday, when they starting dumping stocks even before she spoke, disappointed that expected rate cuts hadn’t materialized. Lagarde failed to demonstrate the “whatever it takes” attitude of her predecessor that we all wanted to see.
Compare that with China. Yes, the nation has given the world a big headache. Still, its sell-off has been fairly mild. Just look at the MSCI China Index, which is down 10% this year — peanuts next to the S&P 500’s 23% slide. The MSCI index is a better gauge of global investors’ attitudes about the mainland than the Shanghai benchmark, because most of its component stocks are traded offshore.
More importantly, China’s bond market is still open, which lowers the chance of a credit crunch and any unpleasant feedback to stocks. Case in point: Junk-rated Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. just issued 5 billion yuan ($712 million) worth of bonds with coupon rates ranging between 2.99% and 4.29%. By comparison, China’s 1-year benchmark lending rate is 3.15%. This is quite an accomplishment considering an oil price war and the virus have practically shut down high-yield bond markets elsewhere, especially in the energy and mining sectors.
Those less familiar with China might say it’s easy to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy in a command economy. That’s certainly true. If you dig deeper, however, Beijing’s policy response has been quite mild. When financial markets are in a panic, it’s not the actual amount of stimulus but the frequency that matters. You’ve got to feed traders with small candies, preferably daily.
Beijing appears to be throwing the kitchen sink at the problem, revising rules on the go and flashing media outlets with grand, empty promises on a regular basis. So far, traders have gobbled it up and are feeling assured that President Xi Jinping is on this.
What has Beijing done, really? The 10 basis point cut to its benchmark rate is nothing compared to the Federal Reserve’s inter-meeting 50 basis point reduction last week. The People’s Bank of China has promised 800 billion yuan of re-lending facilities to support virus-hit enterprises as well as smaller businesses. It has a history of doing much more, such as the 3.5 trillion yuan it has plowed into shantytown developments since 2015.
Now for the fiscal side of things. Beijing has allowed municipal governments to issue special-purpose bonds early — to the tune of 1.8 trillion yuan — and various localities have vowed to spend 3.5 trillion yuan on infrastructure. Those lofty numbers may well amount to absolutely nothing, as my colleague Anjani Trivedi and I have both written.
This brings us to the problem the Federal Reserve will face next week. By selling off on Lagarde’s response Thursday, markets are just preparing Chairman Jerome Powell for the kind of treatment he may get. Futures traders are already betting the Fed will take its benchmark rate all the way to zero. Powell may have no choice but to follow the markets.
How did the Fed allow futures markets to fester to such an extent? The central bank needs to learn what’s already painfully obvious in China: Traders are like children, prone to wild imaginations and tantrums. You’ve got to keep their sugar level steady, like Beijing has done, with frequent policy meetings and banker lunches.
It may just be a matter of time before investors realize China’s lofty ambition lacks substance, and stocks will drift lower. Unlike the rest of the world, we’re not seeing 2008-style meltdowns on the mainland yet. But as the U.S. well knows, such drastic stock declines can trigger a fast deterioration of financial conditions that raises the risk of recession."

Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) also raised the possibility of adjourning the 90-day session early, though that decision will be made on a “day-by-day” basis.
State lawmakers are triaging the more than 2,400 bills still pending before them, advancing the most crucial legislation. The top priorities include the $48.5 billion budget, an overhaul of public schools and coronavirus legislation that, among other things, would give job protections to workers ordered into quarantine. The Senate also fast-tracked a bill to loosen restrictions on telemedicine.
“We will do what it takes to get the most critical and important work done, and nothing more,” Ferguson said.
State legislatures across the country are weighing whether to shut down work.
In Colorado and Idaho, lawmakers are rushing to finish their work early because of the epidemic. The Missouri Senate broke early, and the Ohio House of Representatives canceled sessions indefinitely. In Tennessee, a lawmaker’s request to adjourn early was rebuffed.
In Maryland, the General Assembly has not adjourned early since the Civil War, the Senate president said.
“We need to get out of here,” Senate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings (R-Harford) said in an interview. He suggested that the General Assembly take action on the operating budget, capital budget and emergency bills. “The minute someone in this chamber or that chamber tests positive, we all get quarantined and this gets shut down.”
The general public has already been barred from the Maryland State House under aggressive social distancing policies Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announced Thursday evening. Schools will be closed for two weeks starting Monday, and all gatherings of 250 or more have been prohibited, among many other measures.
In a tweet late Friday, Hogan urged lawmakers to finish a smaller subset of their priorities by Tuesday, prompting a harsh rebuke from House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County).
“Please don’t degrade our collaborative work to Twitter bombs in this time of uncertainty,” she tweeted.
In legislative action on Friday, both chambers gave initial approval to a bill that gives Hogan the authority to reduce costs for testing for the virus, ban price gouging, improve access to telehealth and ensure private and public employees who are under quarantine do not lose their jobs. The legislation was introduced earlier this week by the presiding officers and Sen. Clarence K. Lam (D-Howard), the only doctor in the state Senate.
In the Senate, lawmakers gave initial approval to sweeping public education reforms that, among other things, raise teacher pay, expand prekindergarten and offer more programs to prepare students for college and careers.
“We’re doing things on a statewide scale,” said Sen. Paul G. Pinsky (D-Prince George’s), the chairman of the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee. “We’re doing things, in some ways, that haven’t been done.”
The Senate added more than 50 changes to the House bill, including a provision that would allow the state to pause expanding the reforms if they are not working.
The House gave initial approval to several measures, including a bill that expands the state’s discrimination law to protect hair texture, Afro hairstyles and protective hairstyles, such as braids, twists and locs; a measure that removes the governor from the parole process for certain prisoners sentenced to life; and a bill that imposes the sales tax on lobbying, public relations and telemarketing.
Maryland is one of about 25 states where black lawmakers are pushing the anti-discrimination bill on black hairstyles.
The bill to exclude the governor from the parole process has been introduced in past years but has failed to gain traction. This year’s version also would increase the amount of time an inmate must serve before applying for parole, from 15 years to 20 years.
The sales tax bill — which contained a laundry list of “luxury services,” including dog walking, tanning and fur storage — was pared down to affect only lobbying, public relations and telemarketing.
The presiding officers issued a statement late Thursday to their members that the General Assembly would hold rare Saturday and Sunday sessions to consider some of the “critical” bills that need legislative approval before the session ends next month — if not sooner.
“We have asked House and Senate leadership to prioritize legislation in their communities to the extent possible to finish critical bills in an expedited fashion,” the joint statement reads. “In order to fulfill our constitutional duties and protect the health and safety of all Marylanders, we need to be sure that the Governor has the resources necessary to maintain public health during this extraordinary time.”
The Senate stopped work abruptly after Jennings reported the audio streaming of their session was down, which meant the members of the public who had been barred for the building would be unable to observe the proceedings in any way. “If the Internet stream is not working, I think we should recess,” Ferguson said.
Government watchdog groups Common Cause and Maryland PIRG urged the legislature to adjourn if the public is unable to observe them, writing in a letter to presiding officers that “the legislative process is taking place without the full voice and input of the people of Maryland.”"

After prices plunged in a stock market rout on Thursday, March 12, regulators in various countries attempted to bring stability by restricting equity short selling, or betting with borrowed shares. Shorts, as these bettors are known, say their trading helps keep markets functioning smoothly. Critics say their actions can blur into market manipulation. Regulators keep a wary eye on them during periods of acute market distress, such as now during the coronavirus pandemic.
1. How does short selling work?
Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference. But getting the timing right is crucial. If the stock price rises, they could lose money instead.
2. Who are the short sellers?
Most shorting is done by hedge funds and institutional investors to cushion their investments or to bet that shares have risen too high. There are also so-called activist shorts, who research companies to find targets that they allege have dodgy business or accounting practices, spread the word (sometimes anonymously) and, if all goes as planned, watch the stock slump. Many authorities dislike short selling. The former head of the New York Stock Exchange has described the practice as “icky and un-American.”
3. How is short selling being restricted?
South Korea banned short-selling of shares in the benchmark Kospi index, tech-heavy Kosdaq index and small-cap Konex from March 16-Sept. 15, its first temporary restriction since 2011. Italian and Spanish securities regulators put a one-day ban on short sales of some stocks for Friday March 13. The Spanish move covered 69 equities, including all liquid stocks that fell more than 10% on March 12 and all illiquid stocks that fell more than 20%. In Italy, 85 stocks were affected, which includes some bought and sold on U.K. trading venues. In Thailand, short sales were not banned, but rules are being adjusted. China’s securities regulator suspended securities lending, one of the few short selling tools available in China, in February until further notice, according to people familiar with the situation.
4. Has this ever happened before?
Oh yes. The U.S. targeted short selling during the Great Depression and joined the likes of the U.K., Germany and Japan in limiting short selling or banning it during the financial crisis that erupted in 2008. China’s regulator blamed “malicious” short selling in part for a stock market crash in 2015, placing limits on the practice as well as arresting traders.
5. Is short sellling illegal?
It’s legal in most major stock markets, though some may issue temporary restrictions during periods of market turmoil. What is banned either partially or fully in several markets is so-called naked short selling -- betting on a stock’s decline without having first borrowed the shares."
"March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/why-indias-financial-sector-keeps-blowing-up/2020/03/12/df97722c-64c1-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html,The Washington Post,Why India’s Financial Sector Keeps Blowing Up,"What’s up with India’s $1.7 trillion financial system? In the space of a couple of years, three major finance companies have been seized by authorities and the central bank has had to reassure the public three times. It’s a stark turnaround since the country emerged largely unscathed from the 2008 global financial crisis. Policy makers are grappling with a chicken-and-egg situation: Should they spur credit to boost economic growth or focus instead on cleaning up the world’s worst bad-loan ratio?
1. How did it come to this?
The seeds were sown in a debt-fueled economic boom between 2007 and 2012, when banks increased loans by 400%. When the economy began slowing, though, many companies struggled to repay, making banks reluctant to lend more. That crimped the availability of credit and added a further drag on the economy, heaping pressure on indebted businesses. Some of the slack was picked up by non-bank lenders, or shadow banks, but one of the most prominent -- Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. -- became the first major blowup in 2018 in what became known as India’s mini-Lehman moment.
2. What’s happened since?
The collapse of IL&FS triggered something of a credit crunch and the Reserve Bank of India stepped in to take control of another shadow lender, Dewan Housing Finance Corp., to contain the fallout. A smaller lender also failed in 2019 after allegedly duping investors about its exposure to a property developer. Then, in March 2020, the central bank seized Yes Bank Ltd. in India’s biggest bank rescue.
3. What went wrong at Yes Bank?
Its troubles were rooted in the rapid expansion under its former Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Rana Kapoor. In his last full year in charge through March 2018, Yes Bank had the fastest loan growth of any bank in India. Credit Suisse had noted in a 2019 report the company had the biggest proportion of outstanding loans to large stressed borrowers. Authorities are investigating Kapoor for alleged lending impropriety. He denies wrongdoing.
4. So it’s not just the economy?
No. India’s bad-loan problem was caused by a variety of factors, including government policies. Some borrowers found life harder when authorities suddenly tightened regulations, the courts canceled coal-mining licenses or ordered payment of telecom fees, natural gas supplies dwindled, real-estate prices fell and interest rates rose. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unprecedented decision in 2016 to overnight invalidate almost all of the nation’s physical currency devastated supply chains and created dangerous imbalances in the financial system as Indians rushed to deposit their bills. Making matters worse, there was long a belief among some corporate executives that they could walk away from debts without facing consequences. Regulators allege that some bank chiefs handed to their cronies loans that ended up in default.
5. What are authorities doing and is it working?
The central bank in 2015 began assessing the bad loans, bringing to light the full scope of the problem. Gross non-performing assets across the banking sector surged from about 3% to more than 9%, then breached 10% for the highest ratio in the world. The government has created a new bankruptcy law to aid loan-recoveries but, as the economy decelerates, authorities are also taking steps to spur fresh credit and show more lenience toward certain borrowers and small businesses. The Reserve Bank warned late last year that India’s bad-loan clean up is set to reverse, with soured debt forecast at 9.9% of total credit by September 2020, up from the 9% predicted earlier. Authorities’ moves to seize IL&FS and Yes Bank risk tightening access to credit.
6. Are there more difficulties ahead?
Almost certainly. S&P Global Ratings warns that the bailout of Yes Bank may have “painful side effects” soon, given that some holders of so-called hybrid bonds will lose their entire investment under the proposed rescue plan. Fitch Ratings says India’s domestic wholesale debt markets “may experience another crisis of confidence,” which may tighten financing conditions -- adding more strain on debt-laden companies. And the close links between Yes Bank, the country’s fourth-largest private lender, and other banks, mutual funds and insurers risks spreading contagion. India’s slowing economy faces further threat from the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
7. Any silver lining?
The health of India’s shadow banking sector has improved, albeit from a shaky position. The central bank had been concerned about 10 companies on a list of 50, but is now just focused on four. Healthier shadow lenders could revive credit for consumers buying cars or vacations, potentially giving a shot in the arm to the economy."

A single block near the presidential palace, bristling with guns, has become ground zero in a surreal war of nerves between two civilian politicians both claiming to be the country’s legitimate leader.
Just a short walk from the compound of President Ashraf Ghani, the incumbent whose reelection was announced last month, gunmen in armored vehicles guard the smaller palace of his archrival Abdullah Abdullah, who insists he was cheated out of victory and is forming a parallel government. Across the street, gunmen guard the office of Abdurrashid Dostom, a former army general now allied with Abdullah, who has reoccupied the compound he once used as a vice president under Ghani.
No shots have been fired, giving the confrontation an eerie, stage-managed feel. But as the standoff drags into its second week, many Afghans fear the slightest incident could ignite a violent conflagration between rival camps, plunging the country into chaos and dooming planned negotiations between the government and the Taliban to end Afghanistan’s 18-year war. The insurgents have vowed to continue their attacks if no settlement is reached.
“All the cards are in the Taliban’s hands now,” said Zalmai Rassoul, a former Afghan national security adviser. “If there is no breakthrough within the next week to ten days, something could happen that makes things spin out of control.”
If violence erupts between armed Ghani and Abdullah supporters, he predicted, “within days the Taliban will take several provinces, and this time the United States won’t stop them. At the moment, I am very pessimistic.”
Aides to Ghani said there are still hopes for rapprochement between the warring factions, but so far Abdullah and Dostom, his most powerful backer, have refused offers to switch sides. Dostom, a former warlord who commands a large armed following among ethnic minority Uzbeks, was offered the country’s highest military rank but has refused to budge.
Ghani has said little about the standoff since Mar. 9, when he and Abdullah held competing inauguration ceremonies at the same time a block apart. He has postponed naming a cabinet and refrained from using force to clear the contested city block. Abdullah has pressed on, naming his own governors in several provinces, but Ghani’s team is continuing to meet privately with intermediaries in hopes that he will eventually accept a compromise.
“This is a very unfortunate situation, given the peace process that is very fragile and could get destroyed,” said an adviser to Ghani, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic. “The Taliban is next door, and the public is angry and fearful. But we think there is still room to bargain. Abdullah and his people know that if things get out of control, nobody can put them back. It will be a disaster for Afghanistan for many years to come.”
Others say Abdullah, diplomatic by nature, is now stuck out on a limb, having enlisted hard line ethnic minority bosses to bolster him in his grudge match against Ghani, who defeated him in fraud-marred elections in 2014 and 2019. Last time, the two rivals were forced into a tense power-sharing arrangement under U.S. mediation; this time, despite the hasty patching-up efforts underway, the idea is anathema to both politicians.
For most Afghans, there are far more urgent matters at stake.
Many Kabul residents lived through both the government collapse and civil war of the early 1990s, which destroyed much of the capital, and the years of Taliban religious repression that followed. Many now fear a similar scenario is developing, involving some of the same individuals, the same ethnic and regional tensions, and the same potential for the Taliban to fill the breach and seize power.
Two other factors are adding to the sense of anxiety. One is the looming withdrawal of U.S. troops as part of a recently signed U.S. deal with the Taliban and the declining international interest in their country’s fate. The other is the coronavirus, which has been constantly in the news here as it ravages more developed countries and is now starting to strike in Afghanistan, a poor country with inadequate health facilities.
In conversations across Kabul the past two days, residents struggled to keep their composure as they expressed deepening concern.
“Everyone is worried,” said Abid Sherzai, 45, who runs a grocery while his wife teaches school. “We have Corona, and the Taliban, and the same mujahideen leaders taking sides who once fired rockets at our houses.
“We want peace and calm to bring progress. We want one president, not two,” he said. “We want good educated leaders, not a bad king on every corner. We want to move forward, not back. But with the Americans leaving, who will help us now?”
Most people interviewed said they preferred Ghani over Abdullah, but several said the difference hardly mattered now, compared to the far more important risk that the current power struggle between them could sabotage negotiations between Afghan and Taliban leaders. Those talks were scheduled to begin this week, but they have already been sidetracked by a dispute over the proposed mass release of Taliban prisoners.
Several observers said that the Taliban were already feeling strengthened by the concessionary terms of the U.S. accord signed on Feb. 29, and that the political conflict in Kabul had further lowered their opinion of the Afghan government and political elite. Last week, the Taliban announced that their religious leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, is the country’s only legal ruler.
The feud complicates Ghani’s effort to create a diverse delegation to meet with the Taliban. Abdullah has demanded to send his own group.
More worryingly, it has complicated the military situation in the countryside, where Afghan forces have been battling the Taliban for years. Abdullah is attempting to replace provincial officials with his own allies, potentially dividing security forces that already struggle to put national loyalties over ethnic and personal ones.
“We are on the edge,” said Rahmatullah Nabil, a former national intelligence chief. “If things deepen, it would only take one spark. We could end up with government troops fighting the Taliban and each other. We could end up with triangular negotiations and the country divided into three territories.”
If Ghani and Abdullah don’t find a way to end their standoff and salvage peace talks, Nabil said, “whatever happens will only favor the Taliban.”"

The tweet from Trump came as the country is amid a national emergency as officials work to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, with schools, businesses and other institutions shutting down.
“So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has ‘lost’ the records of General Michael Flynn,” Trump said in a tweet. “How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!”
It is unclear what records Trump was referencing when he alleged that the Justice Department had “lost” material related to the case.
Sidney Powell, Flynn’s attorney, has argued in court that prosecutors have not turned over certain documents to Flynn and his legal team that might be exculpatory, but her allegations have been disputed by prosecutors and rejected by the federal judge overseeing the case. No new filings have been made in the case in several weeks.
Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. But in a stunning reversal two months ago, Flynn asked a federal judge for permission to withdraw his plea, alleging that prosecutors breached his cooperation agreement by demanding false testimony.
The judge later canceled a sentencing hearing for Flynn that had been scheduled for late last month.
If Trump pardons his former national security adviser, it would be the latest such move by the president after several recent high-profile clemency announcements. Last month, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of seven convicted white-collar criminals alongside four others whose cases were not as well known.
The pardons and commutations focused on the type of corruption and lying charges that Trump’s associates were convicted of as part of the Russia investigation. Among those whose crimes were forgiven were disgraced former Illinois governor Rod R. Blagojevich, convicted junk bond king Michael Milken and former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik."

Three years later, as Trump grapples with the greatest crisis he has faced, that choice is costing him dearly.
Trump’s slow and stumbling response to the novel coronavirus pandemic helped accelerate last week’s stock market dive and mounting public uncertainty. But the trouble in the markets was also turbocharged by the latest reckless moves by the Saudi crown prince. Against the advice of his own ministers, Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, moved to flood markets with cheap Saudi oil, causing the global price to plunge and endangering the U.S. oil industry.
That, no doubt, prompted the phone call Trump made to MBS last Monday, as stocks were plunging. It’s an easy guess that the president’s message resembled the public statement of his Energy Department, which decried “attempts by state actors to manipulate and shock oil markets.”
Yet MBS’s reaction was to thumb his nose at the U.S. president. On Wednesday, his oil minister announced another big increase in petroleum production. U.S. stocks swooned again.
Then came the rocket attack by an Iranian-backed militia on a base in Iraq, which killed two U.S. servicemen. That set off a tit-for-tat cycle of U.S. airstrikes and new rocket attacks that has brought Trump back to the brink of war with Iran — a resumption, at the worst possible moment, of an entirely unnecessary conflict that he embarked upon at the behest of MBS and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Since making Riyadh the site of his first foreign trip as president, Trump has stubbornly defended the Saudi ruler through multiple misadventures, from the disastrous war in Yemen and failed boycott of neighboring Qatar to the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The big Saudi purchases of U.S. weapons that MBS promised Trump have not materialized. Instead, the president’s reward is to be stiffed by his supposed ally at his moment of greatest need, with U.S. markets whipsawing and U.S. soldiers dying.
The Saudis claim that MBS is not intentionally seeking to sabotage Trump. The crown prince’s real quarrel, they say, is with Russia’s Vladi­mir Putin, who refused to go along with a Saudi proposal to cut oil production to stabilize prices, thus prompting MBS to rashly pump more while cutting prices.
Yet, in doing so, the crown prince is merely abetting a prime Putin aim, which is to drive the fragile U.S. fracking industry out of business. Not surprisingly, the Russians reacted calmly to MBS’s dumping gambit, saying they could live with rock-bottom oil prices for six to 10 years. U.S. frackers can’t — nor, for that matter, can MBS, who has already strained the kingdom’s finances to the breaking point.
One of the most consistent themes of Trumpian rhetoric has been the ways in which U.S. allies have supposedly exploited Washington’s weakness to pursue their own interests at America’s expense. In one of his first ventures into foreign policy, Trump bought an ad in the New York Times in 1987 to make that case against, among others, Saudi Arabia, “a country whose very existence is in the hands of the United States.” He wrote: “The world is laughing at America’s politicians as we protect ships we don’t own, carrying oil we don’t need, destined for allies who won’t help.”
Saudi Arabia still depends on the United States for its survival. U.S. warships are still protecting tankers carrying Saudi oil in the Persian Gulf, even though the United States needs imported petroleum far less than it did in 1987. What’s more, Trump has dispatched thousands of U.S. troops to the kingdom to defend oil fields from Iranian attack, escalating tensions that have now led to multiple U.S. deaths and injuries.
And yet, Trump has been curiously passive as MBS has repeatedly worked against U.S. interests. Consider the case of Saud al-Qahtani, the close aide to the crown prince who is believed to have overseen the murder of Khashoggi and a hacking campaign targeting MBS’s foreign critics. Senior U.S. officials have repeatedly pushed MBS to hold Qahtani accountable, or at least sideline him; yet as Ben Hubbard of the New York Times reports, “he is still commanding armies of bots and overseeing the kingdom’s electronic spying operations.”
Or consider Trump, with his reelection prospects in danger of crumbling along with the U.S. economy, asking the crown prince to act in his own, as well as the U.S., interest and stop pushing down oil prices amid a market panic — and then remaining silent as a dictator he has coddled for three years does the opposite. Surely, Vladi­mir Putin is laughing."
"March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/03/15/indianapolis-americas-sportiest-downtown-selection-sunday-felt-really-really-sad/,The Washington Post,"In Indianapolis, America’s sportiest downtown, Selection Sunday felt really, really sad","INDIANAPOLIS — The deadness on the weekend here seemed deader than normal deadness. It was the deadness of so many weekends in American downtowns only multiplied and deepened. It was a dead, dead dead. Maybe it’s because around here, the aural memory bank goes all seashell and recollects the sounds of March weekends and Final Fours past.
Hotel lobbies went lifeless with tales of 7 percent occupancy, 9 percent occupancy, with signs that looked useless boasting $6 drafts through March. To walk through the convention center that has spent Marches full of fans coursing through it was to feel the lifelessness, bloodlessness. The four-lane streets named for states had gone desolate. The front of Bankers Life Fieldhouse, where the Pacers play and the Big Ten planned to play, looked blank.
Somehow, all of that and less had become the middle weekend of March in America’s sportiest downtown, amid a state so in love with basketball that it ought to be round. All the sounds had left a downtown that went reimagined and repurposed late last century while hellbent on sporting events, a downtown where somebodies in the planning department back then were doing some thinking, a downtown that resuscitated the ancient practice about which America seemed to forget at some stage: walking. It’s where fans can fill the sidewalks for days of bars and restaurants and games without once plunking into any car seat, but now it had gone inanimate.
Gordon Hayward’s half-court shot for beloved Butler almost went in here. Duke upset 34-0 UNLV here. Wisconsin upset 38-0 Kentucky here. George Mason graced a Final Four here. First titles went here to Denny Crum, to Mike Krzyzewski, to Billy Donovan. Lone, prized titles here went to Tom Izzo, to Lute Olson. Two more went to Krzyzewski here.
Peyton Manning’s Colts finally overcame Tom Brady’s Patriots here — from a 21-3 deficit, no less. Mario Manningham made a mind-bending sideline catch from Eli Manning. The Pacers and the Knicks and the Pacers and the Heat fought here, in a downtown with room for an NFL stadium, an NBA arena, a Class AAA ballpark, headquarters for USA Gymnastics, USA Track & Field, USA Synchronized Swimming, the Black Coaches Association, the National Federation of State High School Associations and, of course, the NCAA.
A Big Ten tournament had stopped by and had left to try to help make the novel coronavirus leave, too; now, just a trickle of fans in Michigan State gear or Iowa gear straggled along, their lodging deals probably inescapable.
A Selection Sunday evening would have made the bars brim.
A Midwest regional would have been here in two weeks.
Now, through the eerie weekend, you could look through a 32nd-floor window and see Lucas Oil Stadium to the right and Bankers Life Fieldhouse in the middle, and if you stared long enough, they looked kind of sad. Now a forklift churned down West Maryland Street, hauling away those metal crowd-control barricades. Now a sole valet stepped outside at Le Méridien Hotel, stood there and looked lonely.
Some bars on a Big Ten title Sunday went ahead and kept their stools up there upside-down on their tables, last call-like. A Big Ten flag outside one bar still fluttered but seemed sad. People told of dining alone in a steakhouse. A good snow doled out big flakes Saturday, but they seemed to frown as they fell.
Big Ten team banners still lurked on lampposts above dead sidewalks next to other banners proclaiming that “March Is On,” relics of a dead tournament. Five Guys felt barren with Elton John’s “Bennie and the Jets” blaring out into the emptiness. One tavern had one-hit wonder Amii Stewart’s disco hit “Knock On Wood,” another with Frank Sinatra interpreting Stevie Wonder’s “You Are The Sunshine Of My Life.”
Hardly anybody heard.
Starbucks, coffee comfort zone of traveling Americans, shut down, signs on the doors. Cafe Patachou, with a brunch wait time normally, did buzz about two-thirds full. One jogger with earphones went by the state-government complex over there. A sole cyclist passed him while dressed brightly as if to alert cars gone absent. One guy at a sparsely peopled hotel bar noted it’s so easy to park.
Events, events and events, splashy ads and more splashy ads. There’s that banner on the windows for 500 Festival: It sprawls through the calendar and celebrates the Indianapolis 500, only now the 10-miler for April 4 is canceled and the kickoff to May, the mini-marathon, the 5K, who knows? There’s that giant sign at Illinois and Maryland blaring about the Indy Eleven and its USL Championship season opener April 4, only now that is suspended a month. There’s that pretty Pacers schedule painted above the empty parking lot across from the arena, with its deserved boast, “We Grow Basketball Here,” only it tells of games of March now deferred at best: Golden State, Miami, Cleveland, Phoenix, Houston.
The Indianapolis Symphony Center has closed for March, robbing ears and souls of “The Passion of Mahler’s Fifth Symphony,” “Ruth Reinhardt Leads the Indiana Symphony Orchestra,” “Mendelssohn’s Elijah.”
On a bench in front of the empty little park nestled between hotels and whatnot and named for William H. Hudnut III, the mayor from 1976 to 1992, a statue of Mr. Hudnut (1932-2016) sat on a bench, as if in thought, certainly in solitude. In the downtown into which he and others pumped so much energy, there was no energy, unless you count that man back over there at Washington and Pennsylvania, operating some sort of laser doohickey on an easel.
He said he was an architect, measuring a building for a project.
He seemed like some outlier, maybe even just arrived from the future."

Italy and Spain have triggered a one-day ban on short selling certain stocks on their respective stock exchanges, and also on U.K. Exchanges, after Thursday’s markets carnage.
It’s done the trick for now as both markets led a recovery rally in Europe on Friday morning, but there’s no news yet on whether the prohibition will be extended. Other European regulators are all doing their own thing; symptomatic of the wider European Union response of dither and delay. A temporary piecemeal fix is not going to solve much bar buying a bit of breathing room. Short sellers tends to come back as soon as the ban is lifted.
And if Europe really wants to take action on short selling in a crisis, it should do it as one. Otherwise you just encourage the hedge funds to move onto a different target while a localized prohibition is in place.  
It’s never a happy sign when stock exchange regulators reach for a short-selling ban. Preventing the free flow of equity markets can just store up problems and deter investors in the longer term. Both Italy (85 stocks) and Spain (69) have chosen just the most oversold securities to include in the ban, which is perhaps an understandable reaction following a total meltdown. South Korea made a more draconian move by banning short selling on all stocks and exchanges for six months.
In a short sale, a trader borrows stock from a broker or bank and sells it at the prevailing market price, betting that a decline will allow him or her to return the shares to the lender after repurchasing them at the new, lower value and pocketing the difference. For the trade to work, some owner of the shares has to be willing to lend them to the short seller. Governments hate it because short attacks can gather a momentum of their own, which may not reflect fundamental problems in a company or other traded assets.
Banning short selling of equities may seem logical, as it does not prevent current holders from liquidating their holdings, but it does reduce liquidity by curtailing long and short trading. The prohibition was triggered several times during the euro crisis but it never really had a conclusive effect — it was more a move of desperation. There’s evidence that assets outperformed when a ban was in place, and underperformed when it was lifted. It was also used for certain sovereign bonds and related futures and option contracts. 
After European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde’s comments on Thursday whacked Italian government bonds, there’s a nervousness among traders that these bans might spread across many other European markets.
Perhaps there does need to be a wider discussion about funds lending out stocks in the first place, for other market players to be able to place short positions. My colleague Mark Gilbert has highlighted the stance that the world’s biggest pension fund is taking against this practice. In the meantime Europe needs to act as one and present a united front on this, as with everything else coronavirus-related."

The benefits the region won from the session that ended last week include increased funding for transportation and schools, and expanded authority for local governments to make changes such as removing Confederate statues and adding solar panels on public facilities.
But Northern Virginia residents may be less enthusiastic about another result: higher taxes for gas and real estate transactions, and the likelihood of additional hikes in local taxes on cigarettes, hotel stays and restaurant meals.
Depending on their attitude toward unions, voters will be thrilled or disappointed that Northern Virginia cities and counties will now almost certainly allow collective bargaining for public employees, including teachers.
The 2020 General Assembly session will go down as one of the most consequential in history. In charge of both chambers for the first time in a generation, Democrats pushed through liberal measures on a broad range of issues ranging from gun control and abortion rights to transit funding and the minimum wage.
It’s natural that top Northern Virginia elected officials welcomed the changes. The region has become a Democratic bastion and is home to most legislative leaders in both the House of Delegates and the Senate.
The Democrats’ victories in the November elections have reversed the frustrating pattern in which Republican majorities in the rest of Virginia have controlled public policy and treated the prosperous Washington suburbs as an ATM to pay for priorities elsewhere.
“From a cash standpoint, we’re going to do better than in the past, because Northern Virginia for the first time has people in leadership [with majorities],” said Jeff C. McKay (D-At Large), chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. “I expect us to do better on school funding, mental health support and human services.”
McKay, the top elected official in the most populous jurisdiction in both the commonwealth and the greater Washington region, said Virginia is finally rewarding the region for its economic dynamism.
“The recognition that you have to invest in Northern Virginia so that it can keep being the economic engine of Virginia is really important. Frankly, people realizing that is probably the number one thing we got out of the session,” McKay said.
There is still a bit of uncertainty about whether Gov. Ralph Northam (D) will try to amend details of some measures passed by the legislature. Fresh concerns about the economic effects of the coronavirus could prompt last-minute changes.
Still, the generally positive impact for Northern Virginia is assured, according to local officials and private analysts.
“This year we asked for 50 different things, and we got a good chunk of them,” Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson (D) said.
Wilson welcomed changes in school funding formulas that will provide extra help to students from low-income families and English-language learners, additional money to build the West End Transitway, and the authority to move a Confederate monument off public land.
“I feel guilty complaining about anything we didn’t get,” such as money for school construction, he said.
Ann B. Wheeler, chair of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, applauded extra funding for K-12 schools and higher education, noting that her county hosts two campuses for Northern Virginia Community College and one for George Mason University.
“The focus on the public education system is wonderful,” Wheeler (D-At Large) said.
To help pay for roads and transit, the legislature restored $50 million a year of the $102 million diverted in 2018 from the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority to pay for dedicated funding for Metro. That will help the region to move ahead more quickly on projects including widening Richmond Highway (Route 1) in Fairfax and adding bus rapid transit there, and widening and improving Route 28 in Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William.
Part of the price is an increase in the tax on real estate transactions in Northern Virginia to 20 cents from 15 cents per $100 of sales price. In addition, the state gas tax will rise by 5 cents a gallon in each of the next two years, and then be indexed to inflation.
In a historic change, counties gained the same authority as cities and municipalities to increase or impose certain local taxes. Counties have relied primarily on property taxes for revenue.
“The real issue here is equity,” McKay said. “It’s absurd that the tiny city of Alexandria [population: 159,000] has far more authority to implement taxes than Fairfax County, with 1.2 million people.”
McKay said he expected Fairfax supervisors would use their new authority to raise the cigarette tax to 40 cents from 30 cents a pack, and the hotel tax above its current level of 4 percent.
But he said “the giant in the room” is the county’s new power to impose a meals tax, beginning in 2022, without submitting it to public referendum. A 5 percent meals tax would raise about $130 million a year, compared to $2 million from the 10-cent hike in the cigarette levy, and $6 million for each one-percentage-point increase in the hotels tax.
McKay said approving a meals tax would allow the county to reduce its property tax, but he said it would be done only after “a thorough conversation with the public,” because voters rejected a meals tax in a 2016 ballot measure.
Arlington’s meals tax was capped at 4 percent, and it will consider using its new power to raise it to 6 percent, according to County Board Chair Libby Garvey (D). She said it would raise $21 million, which would cover most of the $27 million gap between what the school system has requested and what the county has available.
Local jurisdictions may also now allow unions representing teachers and other government employees to engage in collective bargaining — with a provision that strikes are not allowed.
The pro-labor Democrats who lead the region’s jurisdictions hailed the change, as McKay, Wilson, Wheeler and Garvey all said they expected collective bargaining to be approved.
The officials said they have worked well with their employees on contract issues and do not expect collective bargaining to result in pay increases that strain local budgets.
“I don’t think [the teachers] would do it to the detriment of the county,” Wheeler said.
Fairfax Education Association President Kimberly Adams, whose union represents 3,700 teachers and support staff, said her focus in collective bargaining would be on improving working conditions, such as by reducing paperwork, and hiring more staff such as school nurses, counselors and social workers.
But she added that “salary and benefit negotiations are typically something we’d look at,” and that the union wants to see support staff get “a living wage.”
Julie Coons, president of the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, said there was a risk that collective bargaining would be costly.
“The concern there is that they would need to raise taxes to pay for ever-increasing costs of labor contracts,” she said.
Overall, however, Coons said area business leaders were satisfied with the legislature’s actions. The General Assembly left intact the state’s anti-union “right to work” law and agreed to raise the minimum wage more slowly than some Democrats sought.
“It was not ideal from our perspective, but I think there were some good compromises,” Coons said.
In a rare defeat for Dominion Energy, the state’s politically influential electric utility, Northern Virginia governments won expanded capacity to install solar panels on public facilities. Fairfax has been eager to add them at the Lorton landfill and other government sites.
One disappointment for Northern Virginia in the session was limited help in addressing the need for affordable housing, officials said. Also, Garvey hopes to persuade Northam to veto or amend a bill that could allow private companies to deploy delivery robots weighing up to 500 pounds and traveling at 10 mph on sidewalks and roadways.
“We’re not allowed to ban or regulate them,” Garvey said. “I’m worried about safety.”"
"March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/16/what-will-it-take-sanders-leave/,The Washington Post,What will it take for Sanders to leave the race?,"Despite the metastasizing disruption caused by the coronavirus, four delegate-heavy states will hold their primaries on Tuesday. Ohio (136), Illinois (155), Arizona (67) and Florida (219) collectively will allocate 577 delegates. Former vice president Joe Biden leads by double digits in polling in all four states. He therefore almost certainly will extend his current delegate lead (890-736).
This raises the question as to whether Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) intends to remain in the race after Tuesday. He said previously, “I’m not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can’t be won.” Some might have concluded we reached that point after Biden drubbed Sanders last week, winning Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho and Michigan while leading in Washington with 94 percent of the votes counted.
If Sanders loses all four races this week, will he get the hint and back out? The question has more urgency given that Georgia has postponed its primary originally scheduled for March 24. The next primary is currently set for March 29 in Puerto Rico, but the potential for delay remains. Indeed, as some states choose to postpone their primaries, the process would be drawn out even further should Sanders continue his campaign. By ending his race and conceding to Biden, Sanders can initiate the process of unification and planning for Biden’s general-election race. Once Biden becomes the presumptive winner, states that truly are under siege could reschedule their primaries, perhaps formulating a national primary date for all remaining states in May.
The Biden team certainly would like to begin staffing up for the general election and planning for the distinct possibility that there will be no in-person convention. The latter would necessitate a Democratic National Committee rule change. The logistics of such an effort would be daunting. (Would state delegates be able to meet in their home states, or will nearly 4,000 delegates “attend” from the safety of their own homes? What access will be afforded to the media?)
Moreover, the DNC should be making a full-court press now to arrange for no-excuse voting by mail in all 50 states for November (and for primary races for House, Senate and state races). Failure to do so would mean thousands or even millions of people might be effectively disenfranchised depending on the status of the pandemic and the condition of those who might have contracted the virus (as well as their family members who are caring for them). Foot-dragging by the Republicans — whose mission in recent years has been to make voting harder (thereby suppressing the votes of those they think are likely to vote for Democrats) — must cease. Their own voters will be just as likely to be affected, so it would make little sense for them to oppose one uniform system of mail-in ballots.
None of this planning is possible so long as Sanders maintains the pretense that the race is still active. Sanders, once more at risk of becoming the poster boy for sour grapes, would be well advised to stop taking money from donors, to stop inducing volunteers to door-knock and conduct other campaign activities, and to get on with the task of unifying the party and preparing for what is surely to be the weirdest general presidential election in history."

The powerful lobbying group included the recommendation, which faces bipartisan skepticism, among three policy proposals that it said the U.S. should enact in addition to an economic relief package the House passed last week.
The chamber called for the payroll tax to be canceled from March to May. President Donald Trump also has called for a payroll tax cut.
“No family and no business should go bankrupt just because of the temporary disruption in income caused by this outbreak,” Neil Bradley, the chamber’s chief policy officer, told reporters in a Monday call.
The chamber also pushed for the expansion and streamlining of loan programs for small businesses, including removing requirements that firms show they couldn’t access credit before seeking relief from the Small Business Administration. It also suggested creating credit facilities to provide loans and loan guarantees to companies with more than 500 employees if they’ve suffered “significant revenue loss” due to the virus.
All three proposals would require legislation, the group said. Bradley added that the chamber had been in regular contact by phone and email with the White House’s National Economic Council and Domestic Policy Council, the Treasury Department, congressional leadership and Vice President Mike Pence’s office, as he is heading up the virus response.
Emergency Lending
The chamber called for legislation to ease restrictions put in place after the 2008 financial crisis on the Federal Reserve’s use of its emergency lending window, with the aim of ensuring credit flows to bigger companies.
It said the Fed should work with other banking regulators and the Treasury Department to establish a system of credit facilities to provide loans and loan guarantees that can be accessed by businesses.
Bradley said he rejected “the idea that this is somehow a bailout,” pushing back on concerns expressed by some lawmakers that relief might benefit employers more than workers and that congressional action to prop up industries could resemble the unpopular economic packages that were passed to address the Great Recession.
“This is a very different episode than 2008,” Bradley said, emphasizing that the chamber sees the economy returning to strength after the virus and that companies would be able to pay back the loans. “To my knowledge, this is the first time where we’ve had to essentially halt commerce for a period of time.”
The chamber has been ramping up its approach to the virus after its Chief Executive Officer, Tom Donohue, earlier urged consumers to continue shopping and traveling and said, “Now is not the time to overreact or panic.”
The comments at the March 4 news conference “were based on the facts and guidance from federal, state and local officials at that time,” the group said. “The situation has evolved rapidly on a daily basis since then, and we are focused on solutions and resources to mitigate the impact of the virus on the American people and economy.”"

Employees can defer health insurance, tax and utility bill payments for the next three months, while the 3 million poorest Iranians will receive an additional cash subsidy starting from March 17, Rouhani said Sunday in a meeting broadcast on state TV.
Banks will also remove restrictions and limits on check payments for businesses. Relief measures covering taxes and insurance for small to medium-sized enterprises were already announced by Iran’s central bank.
The spread of the virus, which has so far killed 724 people in the Islamic Republic, has forced Iran to seek about $5 billion from the International Monetary Fund, its first request for financial support from the lender since the 1960s.
Iran is grappling with the outbreak at a time when its economy is also the target of renewed U.S. sanctions that have devastated oil exports and isolated it from global banking channels.
Rouhani said there were no plans under way to place any part of the country under quarantine and instead urged people to restrict their movements and stay at home."
"March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/16/joe-biden-sundays-debate-should-terrify-donald-trump/,The Washington Post,The Joe Biden at Sunday’s debate should terrify Donald Trump,"Sunday night’s Democratic debate was billed as the best chance for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to show he still has standing against former vice president Joe Biden. Instead, viewers were treated to something we have not seen throughout the year-long campaign: a truly masterful performance by Biden.
Biden’s debate performances to date had left a lot to be desired. He often gave rambling answers to simple questions. His energy noticeably faded the longer the debates went on. Combined with his many verbal slips on the campaign trail in recent weeks, this left many wondering if Biden had the acuity and stamina it would take to face Sanders alone.
He did, and then some. From the first minute to the last, Biden literally stood tall. While Sanders noticeably slouched, Biden stood ramrod-straight in a perfectly fitted suit. The body language alone sent a strong message that one candidate was vibrant while the other, though energetic, was elderly.
Biden’s verbal performance was better yet. He has a stutter, and there were a couple of instances when he had to force his way through. But those moments were rare and excusable. He otherwise gave the most articulate replies of his campaign. Again and again, Biden gave detailed answers in complete sentences and kept his train of thought throughout his reply.
Over the past year, there have been many times Biden looked like a fighter who had stayed in the ring too long. Sunday night, he looked like a champion at the peak of his game. In short, he looked, sounded and felt presidential.
Sanders didn’t do poorly himself. He controlled his energy well, avoiding moments from prior debates where he would manically wave his arms. He was aggressive at challenging Biden, displayed strong command of detail and looked confident. Sanders did not lose the debate because he was not up to the task.
He lost the debate for the same reason he’s losing the campaign: Democratic voters don’t want what he’s selling. Sanders has believed the United States needs a revolution all his life. His entire debate strategy consisted in showing how Biden doesn’t believe that and, as a result is not the right man to lead the country. Those who believe that likely came away convinced that Sanders is that man. But those people are a minority of Democrats.
The exit polls show this clearly. Only a minority of Democrats voting in the March 17 primaries said that the economy needed a “complete overhaul” or that the next president’s policies should be “more liberal than Obama’s.” Sanders won voters in these demographics but got wiped out among the majority of Democrats who disagreed.
His challenge Sunday night was to convince Democrats who don’t want a revolution that he should be their leader. Sanders didn’t even try to do that, giving Biden an easy win. Biden’s own magisterial performance, however, turned a win into a knockout.
It’s folly to project too far into the future, but the Biden who showed up Sunday night should terrify the Trump campaign. President Trump is normally undisciplined and impassioned when at his best and can be incoherent and angry at his worst. Scared people in a crisis normally want a leader who displays calm resoluteness, not someone whose primary political talent is liberating and channeling passion. If the coronavirus crisis is still with us in the fall, the contrast between the men will be stark and will dramatically favor Biden.
The past month has shown us how radically events can shift in politics. But the Democratic race is not going to dramatically shift again. It’s no longer Biden’s to lose. After the debate, he’s got the nomination all sewn up."

So of course, SoftBank Group Corp.’s Masayoshi Son would announce a share buyback.
This isn’t a crazy idea. It’s well-timed and savvy.The Japanese conglomerate best known for its $99 billion Vision Fund plans to spend up to 500 billion yen ($4.8 billion) to purchase as much as 7% of its own shares. The move doesn’t come totally out of the blue. It’s one of the actions called for by activist investor Elliott Management Corp., which earlier this year took a stake of about 3% in the company, and then called on Son to improve corporate governance and appoint more independent directors.
Son is not alone in seeing opportunity in signs that the global rout could continue, even after his company has lost a third of its value. The announcement came Friday the 13th, a day after U.S. equities dropped the most since Black Monday in 1987. It includes a one-year timeline to conclude the buyback, plenty of time for prices to go lower.   Just hours earlier, Oracle Corp. announced that its board authorized a $15 billion buyback. At the start of the week,Twitter Inc. said that it plans to repurchase $2 billion of shares under measures to placate Elliott, which had also called for changes at the social-media company.  Twitter had only lost 13% from its recent high when it made its announcement; Oracle was off about 29%. That’s how big a difference four days makes.
Investors were starting to question the outlook for Tokyo-listed SoftBank’s portfolio of companies even before the U.S. woke up to the severity of the Covid-19 outbreak. Its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is the single largest asset on the balance sheet. The Chinese e-commerce giant is on track to report one of its worst quarters of revenue growth since listing in 2014.
Of course, the bigger issue is its stable of unicorns that live within the Vision Fund, including Chinese and Southeast Asian ride-hailing companies Didi Chuxing and Grab Holdings Inc. and short-video service ByteDance Inc., as well as troubled Indian accommodation startup Oyo Hotels.
Despite troubles at some of these investments, notably office-rental outfit The We Company (better know as WeWork), Son had brushed off most of Elliott’s concerns at last month’s investor conference and seemed unlikely to enact any of its recommendations beyond a buyback.
Among the impacts of a repurchase, beyond reducing the share pool and concentrating the value of each remaining share, is signalling confidence to investors and boosting the price. Given the macroeconomic and market environment, it’s unlikely Twitter, Oracle or SoftBank’s shares will be able to swim against the tide and quickly rebound. SoftBank, for example, closed 5.1% lower Friday after dropping as much as 9.6%.
Both SoftBank and Oracle are showing streaks of opportunism that emerge quickly in the kind of upheaval we’ve seen in recent days. Expect more — Apple Inc. has plenty of cash, and is overdue for another big buyback announcement.  If you’re committing your company to buying something, then you may as well pay rock-bottom prices for it. We’re still looking for the bottom.
It’s possible that that Son could mistime his buyback, which would make him look a little foolish.  More likely, he’ll wait for an inevitable rebound that will make him seem a genius, a moniker he has failed to earn recently.
Son may appear as though he’s listening to a vocal activist shareholder. Actually, in the rich  tradition of technology companies, he’s just being an opportunist. Watch for others to follow suit."

The powerful lobbying group included the recommendation, which faces bipartisan skepticism, among three policy proposals that it said the U.S. should enact in addition to an economic relief package the House passed last week.
The chamber called for the payroll tax to be canceled from March to May. President Donald Trump also has called for a payroll tax cut.
“No family and no business should go bankrupt just because of the temporary disruption in income caused by this outbreak,” Neil Bradley, the chamber’s chief policy officer, told reporters in a Monday call.
The chamber also pushed for the expansion and streamlining of loan programs for small businesses, including removing requirements that firms show they couldn’t access credit before seeking relief from the Small Business Administration.

Trump said the Senate may act to make the legislation passed overwhelmingly by the House “even better,” although a change would require both chambers to act before Congress can send the bill to his desk. While the Senate is in Washington this week, the House is on a scheduled week-long break.
“We want it for everybody,” Trump said of the sick leave provisions. The Senate is working to “enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody, and that’s what we’re looking to do.”
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also went to Capitol Hill to discuss the package with senators.
“We’re here to update the Senate on the existing legislation,” Mnuchin told reporters. “More importantly, we have a lot of work to do here and we’re going to start working with the Senate on new bills as well.”
The House-passed legislation includes enhanced jobless benefits, increased food aid for children, senior citizens and food banks, and higher funding for Medicaid benefits, as well as a temporary mandate for companies with fewer than 500 workers to give employees paid sick and family leave.
Congressional leaders worked through snags over some language in the bill and objections raised by a few Republicans. It wasn’t clear whether the president had consulted with Republican leaders in Congress before suggesting that they should make changes.
As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell entered the Capitol earlier in the day, he said the chamber would take up the bill “as quickly as we can get consent,” suggesting a push to get Republicans on board for a vote this week.
Weak and Unacceptable
Although Trump had publicly backed the legislation and urged Congress to quickly pass it, the exemptions in the sick leave provision have drawn criticism from some Republicans, as well as labor groups.
GOP Senator Mike Braun of Indiana said he joins Ron Johnson of Wisconsin in thinking unemployment benefits would be a better way to administer paying for the sick leave than through a business tax credit. He also suggested offering the leave incrementally and reassessing every few weeks.
”A few days is not going to hurt to get a better version” of the House relief legislation, said Braun.
Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on Fox News Monday that the House-passed bill “doesn’t go far enough and it doesn’t go fast enough,” adding that he’s spoken to a lot of other senators who agree.
On the other end of the political spectrum, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union blasted the bill as “weak” and “unacceptable” because it would exempt big corporations who employ about 80% of the workforce.
The legislation was already held up in the House Monday by delays in some technical corrections to the bill, which was written hastily Friday and passed after midnight following three days of negotiations between Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The fix is designed to help get more support from pro-business Republicans.
Senator Dick Durbin, a member of Democratic leadership said the foot-dragging was delaying the impact the legislation could have and unnecessarily risking exposure of lawmakers to the coronavirus in the Capitol, where several staff members have tested positive.
”We have members of the Senate going in and out of quarantine!” Durbin said Monday on the Senate floor. “We should do our work and do it quickly.”
“You have to ask yourselves, are we being respectful of ourselves, our family or staff, are we being respectful of our responsibility as setting a model for the rest of America?” Durbin asked.
Earlier Monday, Texas Representative Louie Gohmert threatened to object to changes in the House bill, saying the legislation wasn’t released with enough time for lawmakers to study the text. Gohmert could stop the House from approving the technical changes this week because the chamber needs unanimous support to pass legislation when lawmakers aren’t in Washington, and House members left town Saturday.
It’s unclear when the Senate will vote on the virus bill. It would take the permission of all 100 senators to move to the virus bill early in the week without going through a more lengthy procedure.
Small Businesses
Mnuchin said Sunday that the administration is trying to allay concerns about the legislation, which is aimed at blunting some of the economic impact for workers and families as the coronavirus outbreak spreads in the U.S. In addition to being on Capitol Hill Monday, Senate Republicans invited Mnuchin to speak at their Tuesday lunch, according to a person familiar with the matter.
“We are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this. We were very focused, we need to get the money to people quickly,” Mnuchin said on the “Fox News Sunday” program. “We don’t want them to have to deal with big bureaucracy.”
Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, an ally of the president, criticized the paid sick leave provision in a statement Saturday and pushed for an alternative approach that would have states alter unemployment insurance programs to pay workers staying home because of the virus.
The measure is expected to eventually clear both chambers in some form. Congressional leaders in both parties also are in the early stages of weighing other legislation aimed at boosting the broader economy and helping airlines and other industries.
On Monday morning, the House was almost entirely empty and Gohmert was one of the few lawmakers in the chamber, talking with an aide. His mere presence signaled that he would object if anyone tried to bring up the fix.
The Texas Republican spoke for half an hour with an aide, then left briefly and walked to the office of Senate Majority Whip John Thune for what he thought was a meeting. He left after being told the No. 2 GOP leader wasn’t there.
Gohmert said the bill that passed Saturday had a “major problem screwing over both workers and small business owners. It didn’t set out how the workers were going to be compensated.”of"
"March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/the-trump-administration-has-been-drawn-into-a-renewed-crisis-in-iraq/2020/03/16/7328a1a0-67ab-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html,The Washington Post,Trump’s reckless decisions have led to an unnecessary Middle Eastern crisis,"IN THE shadow of the mounting covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration has been drawn into another cycle of escalating hostilities with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. Twice since March 11, volleys of rockets launched by Tehran’s proxies have struck the sprawling Camp Taji base north of Baghdad, killing two Americans and seriously wounding at least two others. A retaliatory U.S. strike hit five sites described as weapons depots for the Kataib Hezbollah militia, leaving a number of militiamen and several Iraqi government soldiers dead. Both sides are threatening further action.
The renewed hostilities suggest that Iran and its Iraqi proxies were undeterred by the killing of senior Iranian strategist Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani and a senior Iraqi militia commander in a U.S. drone strike in early January. They raise anew two critical dangers for the Trump administration: that Iran will succeed in pushing U.S. forces out of Iraq, or that it will draw the United States into a larger military conflict.
Those might seem like extraordinary ambitions for the regime of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei at a time when it is grappling with one of the world’s most severe outbreaks of coronavirus, on top of a severe economic contraction and mounting domestic unrest. But the ruling ayatollah may see conflict with the United States as the best way out of his internal challenges; after all, the death of Soleimani produced a rare outpouring of nationalist sentiment.
Moreover, the Iranian campaign against U.S. forces in Iraq is not easily countered. It is hard to defend U.S. forces posted on Iraqi military bases from sudden volleys of short-range rockets, like those that have rained down on Camp Taji in the past week. And retaliatory U.S. action inside Iraq risks further alienating the Iraqi government, some of whose leaders are already pressing for a U.S. withdrawal.
President Trump may well be tempted to withdraw the 5,000 U.S. troops deployed to fight the Islamic State in Iraq. On Monday the anti-Islamic State mission announced that hundreds of troops would be redeployed from several smaller bases to larger ones in Iraq, or in Syria and Kuwait. While that may be prudent in view of the mounting risk of rocket attacks, a full U.S. pullout would hand Iran a major strategic victory. Having made containment of Tehran’s regional ambitions a pillar of his foreign policy, Mr. Trump would have ensured Iranian dominance in Iraq as well as Syria and Lebanon.
One alternative is to step up U.S. counterstrikes against Iranian targets in Iraq and perhaps in Iran itself, in an effort to restore deterrence. That would risk a political backlash in Iraq and perhaps more U.S. casualties from Iranian counterattacks — which is what the hard-line Iranian leadership may be hoping for. Or U.S. commanders could seek to muddle through with partial redeployments, more defensive measures and appeals to Iraqi leaders to rein in Iran’s proxies.
In all, Mr. Trump faces a perilous Middle Eastern morass that is mostly of his own making. His reckless decision to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran and renew economic warfare on its regime has led directly to an unnecessary crisis he must now manage amid the covid-19 pandemic."
"March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/airlines-wont-get-something-for-nothing/2020/03/16/a624ff08-6789-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,Airlines Won’t Get Something For Nothing,"Airlines aren’t very popular at the best of times. A mode of transport used most often by the wealthy has been attacked for its planet-heating carbon emissions. Many airlines have spent recent years cutting frills, squeezing more passengers into economy cabins and charging for things that once were free. They now risk being blamed for accelerating the spread of the coronavirus. Bailing out such as industry will be hugely controversial – if you rescue airlines, why not cruise lines, hotel owners or tour operators (like Tui AG)?
As with the banks in 2008-2009, governments may have to put aside any residual ill-feeling and provide cash support to a vital sector. Though not systemic in the same way that banks are, airlines support domestic and international connectivity and they help carry about one third of global trade by value. Without assistance, scores could go bust.
But if governments provide assistance, there must be conditions attached.
Unlike the state of the world’s financial plumbing a decade ago, the problem airlines have is a very simple one. Many are having to ground upwards of 75% of their fleets due to flying restrictions and an absence of future demand. Forced to provide refunds and without new revenue coming in, they’re hemorrhaging cash. Lower fuel prices are only of limited help in such an environment. While the best airlines have built a financial cushion for unexpected demand slumps, even the September 11 attacks didn’t lead to a situation as economically devastating as this.  
Of course, it’s essential that airlines do all they can to preserve cash before demanding that governments step in. Dividends must be axed, share buyback programs suspended, executive remuneration scaled back and capital expenditures delayed. Recruitment must be frozen and wage costs curtailed. Unused credit lines are being drawn down. Airlines like Lufthansa AG that bought rather than leased aircraft are better placed as these can be used as collateral for new loans.
Already, the European Union has promised to suspend rules that require airlines to keep flying to retain valuable takeoff slots. Tax holidays and exemption from various charges will doubtless be next. The role of credit-card acquirers that hold back revenues from struggling carriers is being queried.
But it’s doubtful this will be enough. The virus shows no sign of being under control either in Europe or the United States. Once it is, air travel bookings might recover only gradually. “Coordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over,” Easyjet Plc boss Johan Lundgren said on Monday.
Of course, there’s a debate to be had about whether all airlines deserve assistance; some like Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA and Alitalia were in financial trouble before the virus crisis struck. When the perennially struggling British regional airline Flybe collapsed, rivals like Ryanair Holdings Plc were some of the most vocal in saying the government shouldn’t step in.
Still, don’t be surprised if authorities set aside questions of moral hazard. Rightly or not, there’s still a very strong association between nationhood and having a decent airline. (The large Gulf airlines are still state-owned, while the French and Dutch governments are anchor shareholders of Air France-KLM)
This needn’t be a loss-making exercise for taxpayers, assuming it is managed properly. If countries purchase or enlarge existing equity stakes in airlines, these can be sold later once the industry recovers. Loans can also be repaid once people start flying again.
But any cash assistance should be bound by rules: in the more fragmented European market that might mean nudging airlines to consolidate. Airlines everywhere need to show their spending is directed towards curtailing carbon emissions in line with Paris climate agreement. As with the banking world a decade ago, the aim must be to promote a healthier industry once the current crisis abates."
"March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/17/bailout-recession-economy-pearlstein/,The Washington Post,Let the bailouts begin,"Next up on the pandemic policy agenda: a rescue plan for the airlines and other industries hit hard by the global coronavirus pandemic.
This week you can expect to hear warnings from business groups about the jobs that will be lost, the bankruptcies that will be triggered, the financial panic that will ensue and the recession that will be prolonged if the government fails to act quickly and aggressively.
And there will be the predictable rants about putting taxpayers on the hook for “bailing out” undeserving shareholders, banks and hedge fund managers even as waiters, taxi drivers and maids are left to fend for themselves.
Democrats will accuse Republicans of groveling to Wall Street and business interests while Republicans will accuse Democrats of groveling to unions and wanting to pick winners and losers. In the end, a rescue package with a price tag of hundreds of billions of dollars will be narrowly approved by both houses of Congress over the opposition of partisans and ideological purists in both parties.
So here is a program guide for the political melodrama that is about to unfold.
Let’s start with the word “bailout,” which will be tossed around indiscriminately in coming weeks by politicians and pundits and headline writers. Bailout has a pejorative connotation, one that suggests people and companies who should have known better are saved from the consequences of their own risk-taking with large gifts of government cash.
But in this case, the pejorative does not apply. For if anything qualifies as an event outside human control — an “act of God” as the contract lawyers put it — certainly it is a pandemic. Nor is this a case of anyone acting recklessly.
Certainly any rescue will involve providing badly needed cash to private companies that would otherwise be forced to default on loans, file for bankruptcy or close their doors. But under most scenarios, the aid will come in the form of loans that will have to be repaid with interest, or equity investments that should give the government a profit once the crisis has passed. Or there could be some combination of the two, such as convertible bonds or loans packaged with warrants to give the government the right to later buy company stock at today’s low prices.
Skeptics will surely note that companies get into cash squeezes for all sorts of reasons all the time without the government riding to their rescue. But what’s different here is we’re talking about thousands of companies with tens of millions of workers and tens of billions of dollars in debt owed to American banks and investors.
If companies don’t find a way out of their temporary cash squeeze, then the collapse of one entity will lead to the collapse of another, and then another, in the manner of falling dominoes — a financial contagion to mirror the viral one going on outside. The reason for doing it is not because it’s fair — it’s not — but because lots of innocent bystanders will get hurt if you don’t. We do it for us, not for them.
From a policy standpoint, the trick is to do it in a way that provides a safety net for workers and customers who are most vulnerable, while insisting investors and lenders accept some of the financial pain. Structuring these rescues is as much art as science, and no matter how well you do it, there is no way to make them completely fair.
It is pretty clear at this point that, for the next several months, airlines, cruise lines, hotel chains and theme parks will not be taking in enough revenue to service the interest payments on the debt they took on to buy their planes, boats, buildings and other equipment. But it’s not just them.
What about the companies that sell jet fuel to the airlines, or provision food to the cruise ships, or provide sophisticated computer reservation systems to the hotels? Or the restaurants, taxi companies, bus tour operators and sidewalk vendors that are no less dependent on tourists and business travelers? And what about the owners of professional sports teams, or NASCAR sponsors or the NCAA? It’s not so obvious where the eligibility line should be drawn.
Then there is the practical reality that the government simply doesn’t have the capacity to review the financial situation of millions of businesses and quickly determine which ones genuinely need capital and will be viable enough to pay it back. In addition, the potential for fraud and political favoritism is significant.
So here’s what you can expect. For the largest companies in the industries most heavily impacted, the U.S. Treasury will likely be authorized to provide temporary equity investments, loans and loan guarantees tailored to the needs of each company, much as it did with the banks,auto companies and the mega-insurer AIG in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
In some cases, the mere fact that the capital is available will give lenders the comfort they need to renegotiate and extend their existing loans. In other cases, the government will have to provide funds and guarantees. No matter how they are structured, however, these rescue packages should put the government first in line for repayment and to earn a tidy profit when companies eventually return to profitability.
Behind the scenes, airlines, cruise lines, hotel companies and theme parks are already making the case that the government should simply hand over an initial tranche of cash to compensate them for the lost revenue they suffered as a result of government restrictions on travel or large gatherings. That would be a mistake.
Although there is precedent for such grants to the airlines in the 9/11 rescue package, that was a time when airlines were routinely reorganizing under the bankruptcy code. But after 20 years of unchecked consolidation, the airlines — along with hotel operators and theme parks — have become disciplined oligopolies characterized by high prices and profits. They should get no better deal from the government than if they were seeking capital from Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.
That’s not all the government should demand. Until the government gets its money back, the companies should be prevented from paying any executive more than $2 million a year in salary, bonus and stock incentives, which would be a comedown for the chief executives of nearly all of these companies. They should also be prevented from paying shareholders any dividends or buying back any shares of their stock. And rather than laying off a large number of employees, they should be required whenever possible to institute job-sharing programs so that all employees remain on the payroll part-time until the crisis has passed. The details of these deals should be posted on the Treasury website, along with an audited accounting of when and how the money has been repaid.
As for the thousands of smaller companies affected by the pandemic, the Small Business Administration should be authorized to guarantee loans made by private banks. Such guarantees, however, should extend only to 75 percent of any loan, insuring that the banks accept the first loss from any loan that is not repaid. Only in that way will banks have sufficient incentive to insure that only creditworthy companies receive the loans. Without such safeguards, the program runs a high risk of becoming a costly and embarrassing boondoggle.
The politics of these rescue packages are particularly tricky for Republicans, who will find themselves torn between the political instinct to reward their allies in the business community and their ideological opposition to government interference in the market economy.
For Democrats, it is the opposite. While they are reluctant saviors of Wall Street banks and investors, they are also eager to protect workers and demonstrate the need for government management of the economy in the face of repeated market failures.
Voters are similarly conflicted. While they demand that government do something to contain economic crises, they are resentful about anything that smacks of a bailout. President George H.W. Bush learned that lesson after the rescue of the savings and loan industry in late 1980s, as did President Barack Obama following the rescue of Wall Street and the auto companies in 2009.
President Trump seems determined to avoid the same mistake. As a faux-populist president who promised to “drain the swamp,” he cannot allow himself to be seen riding to the rescue of big business, particularly an industry in which he has a large personal financial stake. Yet as a politician he is acutely aware of the connection between the economy and his own reelection. He also knows he cannot afford to allow a public health crisis to turn into a financial crisis.
For that reason, look for Trump to keep his distance from the negotiations with industry leaders and Congress, leaving that task to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trusted son-in-law Jared Kushner. And don’t expect any signing ceremony in the Rose Garden.
One would hope that once the rescue is put in place, top executives of the rescued firms would have the good manners to thank taxpayers publicly for helping them through these tough times. And maybe — just maybe — they will have second thoughts the next time they are tempted to complain about excessive government interference in the workings of the free market."
"March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-short-sellers-become-targets-during-market-routs/2020/03/17/69dfc5b8-6843-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,How Short Sellers Become Targets During Market Routs,"When stock prices plummet in a market rout, short sellers often become a target. Regulators can attempt to curtail the plunge by restricting equity short selling, or betting with borrowed shares. Shorts, as these bettors are known, say their trading helps keep markets functioning smoothly. Critics say their actions can blur into market manipulation. During periods of acute market distress, such as now in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, some of the hardest-hit countries are again imposing bans.
1. How does short selling work?
Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference. But getting the timing right is crucial. If the stock price rises, they could lose money instead.
2. Who are the short sellers?
Most shorting is done by hedge funds and institutional investors to cushion their investments or to bet that shares have risen too high. There are also so-called activist shorts, who research companies to find targets that they allege have dodgy business or accounting practices, spread the word (sometimes anonymously) and, if all goes as planned, watch the stock slump. Many authorities dislike short selling. The former head of the New York Stock Exchange has described the practice as “icky and un-American.”
3. How is short selling being restricted?
France’s AMF regulator halted such trades in 92 stocks for a day on March 17, while Italy’s Consob blocked the transactions in shares of 20 companies and Belgium’s FSMA imposed a similar restriction. Spain went further, telling market participants they couldn’t bet on share declines for a month. Madrid, as well as Italy, had already ordered a one-day ban on short selling in the March 13 sessions. South Korea has banned short-selling of shares in the benchmark Kospi index, tech-heavy Kosdaq index and small-cap Konex from March 16 to Sept. 15. China’s securities regulator in February suspended securities lending, one of the few short selling tools available in China, until further notice, according to people familiar with the situation. The European Union’s market regulator has ordered hedge funds and other traders to disclose more information when they bet that stocks will decline and signaled that more restrictions could come.
4. Has this ever happened before?
Oh yes. The U.S. targeted short selling during the Great Depression and joined the likes of the U.K., Germany and Japan in limiting short selling or banning it in 2008 during the global financial crisis. China’s regulator blamed “malicious” short selling in part for a stock market crash in 2015, placing limits on the practice as well as arresting traders.
5. Is short selling illegal?
It’s legal in most major stock markets, though some may issue temporary restrictions during periods of market turmoil. It was already under attack before the stock market started tanking in February. French politicians prepared a report last year on ways to rein in short sellers and activist investors, and German authorities began an investigation into speculators who criticized the accounting of payments company Wirecard AG. What is banned either partially or fully in several markets is so-called naked short selling -- betting on a stock’s decline without having first borrowed the shares."
"March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/17/masks-might-not-help-tossing-salt-over-shoulder-sure-people-want-believe/,The Washington Post,"Masks don’t help, but tossing salt over the shoulder? Why people want to believe.","In response to the coronavirus pandemic, countless people are covering their mouths and noses with surgical masks and buying up most stores’ inventories. The problem, as the experts keep telling us, is that most masks are ineffective for people who are not sick — and buying the better models, which people aren’t trained to use correctly, limits their availability for those who really need them. Witness, too, runs on toilet paper and, perhaps even more puzzling, paper towels.
One possible reason is that in times of heightened stress, people tend to resort to “magical thinking” and superstitious behavior — particularly when there seem to be few ways to exert control over a situation.
The first line of psychological defense in a crisis is often denial. But as evidence of the disease’s scope grows (more than 150 countries affected, over 7,000 deaths, more than 150,000 infected), documented by dire news reports, denial becomes implausible. That leaves another comforting option: clinging to the belief that one can ward off undesired outcomes by engaging in behaviors that bear little to no relationship to accepted laws of science and nature. According to a 60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll from 2015, for example, although only 24 percent of Americans say they are “somewhat” or “very” superstitious, 60 percent “knock on wood” to prevent unwanted outcomes from occurring.
Some people who do these things may be acting out of habit or tradition, of course — not a firmly held belief in the effectiveness of it as a deterrent. But there is evidence that, for some people, magical thoughts reduce anxieties. In a study involving 167 male and female university students, Harvard University behavioral scientist Alison Wood Brooks and her team concocted a stressful event — everyone would sing, solo, in front of a group of strangers. Some of the test subjects were assigned to draw a picture encapsulating how they were feeling, throw salt over the drawing, crinkle up the paper and toss it in the garbage — arbitrary actions that the research team told participants were superstitious behaviors designed to ward off bad luck. The researchers found that the people who did these things experienced a drop in heart rate of five beats per minute compared to people who did not perform the ritual: It quieted their mounting anxieties.
While magical thinking might be a harmless habit in most situations, a quirk of human psychology, it can be deadly in others — as when people hoard masks during a pandemic.
Researchers have studied myriad ways in which people deploy magical thinking as a protection against harm. During the Gulf War in 1991, social scientist Giora Keinan surveyed 174 Israelis who were living under high and low threat of attack from Iraqi missile strikes. In Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan, the danger was high; in Jerusalem and Tiberias, it was relatively low. Keinan asked all study participants the degree to which they would be likely to (if they had the chance) rip a photograph of Saddam Hussein to pieces during a missile salvo. Or if they would step into their safest, sealed room right foot first — an act thought to bring good fortune. Israelis in the high danger regions endorsed these irrational behaviors 36 percent more strongly compared with Israelis living in safer neighborhoods. Those who were most likely to do such things were the participants who said (in a different part of the study) that they felt uneasy when they could not control events around them. Magical rituals, in short, offered an illusory sense of control.
Likewise, during the Ebola outbreak of 2016 in West Africa, in which fatality rates for the infected hovered around 50 percent, sociologist Eric Tenkorang surveyed 800 Ghanaians, and found that they generally knew the sources of transmission (contact with bodily fluids, eating brush meat like antelope), symptoms of Ebola at onset (fever, diarrhea) and effective prevention measures endorsed by the World Health Organization: washing hands with soap and altering funeral practices to avoid contact with the body of someone that had died from Ebola. But they also reported believing that hot saltwater baths acted as an effective preventive vaccine though doctors had told them otherwise — and they took such baths.
How, during the current pandemic, can we satisfy our psychological need for control — but in ways that effectively reduce transmission of the virus? We can embrace scientifically validated rituals, such as hand-washing, for one thing. We can choose whether we wash thoroughly every time we use the restroom or touch surfaces like doorknobs. We can control our exposure to others through social distancing. We can choose how we greet others — opting for elbow bumps over handshakes. These are decisions we make consciously, several times a day, and they grant us some sense of self-determination during an uncertain time.
Other decisions, such as avoiding unnecessarily travel, staying in one’s house and keeping an eye out for symptoms in oneself and one’s loved ones, are crucial — even if they don’t provide quite the same sense of control as more ritualistic behavior.
But the first step toward adopting healthy habits is recognizing our natural propensity to find protection where it can’t really be found. Which means: Ditch the face mask, grab the soap and embrace your time at home."

Similarly, economic damage is inevitable, yet large-scale monetary and fiscal measures can prevent the worst from happening in that realm.
There are encouraging signs that the national political leadership is stepping up to the task — late, but possibly not quite too late. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin backed a plan to get cash to ordinary American households immediately, targeted to those lower on the income scale. In doing so, he abandoned President Trump’s previous insistence on a slower-acting, less-targeted payroll tax holiday, in favor of following what economists from both parties had been recommending for days. Even better, Mr. Trump said he is fully on board, in a rare but welcome — if implicit — indication that he can listen to others when it really counts. On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are discussing large-scale fiscal relief plans, ranging near $1 trillion, in a spirit, so far, of bipartisanship. Unemployment insurance, Medicaid funds and other aid to the most vulnerable must be part of the plan. Next up will be taxpayer-funded relief for key sectors of the economy — from transportation to energy — that have been particularly hard hit.
It’s important to understand why timely, targeted and — we hope — temporary fiscal intervention of this scale is justified, indeed essential, even at a time of already massive federal debt.
First, the Federal Reserve has nearly maxed out on its ability to help, having cut interest rates to zero, announced at least $700 billion in asset purchases, dollar swaps with other nations’ central banks and extended liquidity assistance to the financial sector. These steps can help prevent financial panic and lay the basis for post-crisis recovery, but their short-run impact is limited. Even with the Fed setting the cost of capital at rock bottom, there’s not much incentive for private investment now.
Second, this is not a downturn brought on by speculation or other forms of business irresponsibility. It is a sudden stop to both production and consumption undertaken at the recommendation of the authorities to help save lives. No one, not even a big business, deserves to be punished for that. To the contrary, many businesses in potential need of assistance now had been well run and, when healthy, represent strategic assets of the U.S. economy. Federal aid therefore does not represent a reward for “bad behavior,” as, arguably, the 2008 bailout did. And even that was better than the alternative, which was to stand aside and let the economy crash. Government can, and should, place conditions on any aid to industry: For example, companies should have to promise there will be no layoffs and accept limits on executive compensation.
In other words, Congress and the president can act without the usual concerns for budget constraints or the fear of rewarding or encouraging bad behavior. Indeed, they must do so, lest this sudden crisis go from manageably bad to disastrously worse."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/embracing-the-grace-of-covid-19/2020/03/17/a50446ee-688b-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html,The Washington Post,Embracing the grace of covid-19,"PAWLEYS ISLAND, S.C. — An odd thing happened last Sunday. A friend was visiting and invited me to join her for church — not in a physical house of worship but streamed via Zoom from her pastor in Arlington, Va.
Churches around the state are suspending services, and the Rev. David Martin Hanke of Restoration Anglican Church was road-testing Zoom with congregants who wanted to worship virtually. Jody and I sat side by side, possibly in our PJs, while Hanke fidgeted with various audio and visual gadgets. Fellow parishioners — some solo, some couples, others families — came into focus in a Hollywood Squares grid along one side of the screen.
Most were casually dressed, as was Hanke, who was seated in his office. At one count, more than 100 had joined the service, which meant that at least 200 would have been seated in the pews on a pre-coronavirus Sunday. Zoom, which I hadn’t experienced previously, made possible what the virus had made impossible — the gathering of community in common prayer and worship. At one point, some attempted to sing a hymn a cappella. Let’s just say, the Apostle’s Creed and the Lord’s Prayer were smoother.
More novel than the virtual service was the experience of joining a friend of 20 years in prayer. Our more natural bonding experiences have revolved over the years around journalism and, in the sole interest of anthropological research, shopping. For just a moment, I wasn’t sure which pitch and volume I should seek. But something happened that was both personal and intimate — and yet of all one thing.
Perhaps this is why so many people attend a house of worship regularly. Or, perhaps, the danger of a life-threatening disease opens us up to the possibility of grace. As Americans and people around the world seek answers during this strangest of times, I suspect millions of others will seek spiritual solace along with the medical tests that may foretell each individual’s degree of suffering or reprieve.
In the meantime, social distancing and self-quarantine these next couple of weeks (or longer) offer opportunities we might not otherwise have had. I was struck by Hanke’s plea that we embrace the slowing down. Some people may feel lonely as they ride out the virus in isolation; others may feel crowded by large families or rambunctious children.
But many will also have a chance to enjoy that rarest of pleasures or perhaps torments — free time. The 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal said that “all of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” On normal days, for many of us, it’s off to the races preceded by a rude and ruthless alarm. There are stocks to trade, newspapers to publish, movies to direct, businesses to run, children to educate, invalids to feed and, yes, wars to wage. So accustomed are we to the weird virtue of multitasking that the notion of sitting alone in a room can be more angst-inducing than a multitude of alternatives.
Now, suddenly, there’s time to think — to read, write, paint, build, create. Time for long walks, time to pay attention to the arrival of spring and time to listen. Grace, they say, comes to those who listen. Of course, so much time will drive some people crazy, so it really is a challenge as well as an opportunity. Binge-watching movies is also an option, don’t get me wrong. As a highly functional obsessive-compulsive, I’ve already reorganized my refrigerator to within an inch of its life and am plotting other projects that will leave no molecule unturned.
Who knows what will come of all this? When Shakespeare was quarantined during the plague, he wrote “King Lear.” The only book I ever wrote was while I had a broken leg, a lesser contribution to the arts, I concede. Perhaps I’ll write another — or at least long letters to friends I never meant to set aside.
I’ve often said that America needs a common enemy to make us come together — to solve the riddle of partisan gridlock and to become one, united nation again. Perhaps covid-19 is that foe. Hanke closed out his sermon by reminding us that it doesn’t matter whether we are lined up in pews or piled on a sofa with a gaggle of giggly children waving to their Sunday school pals on a computer.
What matters, in good times as well as bad, are people and community. It has taken a terrible virus to at least remind us of this eternal truth. Surely, there is grace in that."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/17/boeing-asks-at-least-60-billion-trump-expresses-support-bailout/,The Washington Post,Boeing suggests at least $60 billion to help aerospace manufacturing industry,"President Trump said in a news conference Tuesday that he supports a bailout for Boeing, which has been reeling from the combined economic fallout of the global pandemic and a prolonged safety crisis involving its flagship commercial jetliner.
Without providing details of a bailout package, the president said that “we’ll be helping Boeing,” which previously confirmed it was in discussions with top government officials about short-term access to cash. Boeing’s stock price has lost 44 percent of its value in the past five days alone.
Trump alluded to troubles with the 737 Max jet, which has been grounded for more than a year after equipment problems played a role in two deadly crashes.
“It was unthinkable what happened to Boeing … unthinkable,” Trump told reporters. “Probably I would [have] considered it the greatest company in the world prior to a year ago, now they get hit 15 different ways. … It was coming along well, and then all of a sudden this hits. So we’ll be helping Boeing.""
Shortly after the president’s comments, Boeing published a statement saying there should be a minimum of $60 billion in “public and private liquidity, including loan guarantees” for the aerospace manufacturing industry. The details of a potential bailout have not been announced.
“We appreciate the support of the President and the Administration for the 2.5 million jobs and 17,000 suppliers that Boeing relies on to remain the number one US exporter, and we look forward to working with the Administration and Congress as they consider legislation and the appropriate policies,” Gordon Johndroe, vice president of communications at Boeing, said in a statement sent to reporters.
“Until global passenger traffic resumes to normal levels, these measures are needed to manage the pressure on the aviation sector and the economy as a whole,” Johndroe wrote.
The company confirmed Monday that it had been in discussions with “government leaders” about short-term access to public and private funds.
Boeing’s request for public help underscores the dire financial straits the company finds itself in, as dual crises threaten to severely complicate its return to financial health. On March 13, the company drew out the full amount of its $13.8 billion private loan, citing concerns about whether it would have access to cash should the markets worsen. It also halted new hires.
The coronavirus pandemic and its related market volatility came at a time when Boeing’s business was already vulnerable. The company has struggled to convince regulators that the 737 Max ― the newest version of its best-selling jet ― is safe to fly after two deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed hundreds of people. After Boeing leadership admitted that the jet’s flight control systems played a role in both crashes, regulators have continued to find problems with the plane, repeatedly pushing back the jet’s recertification timeline. Boeing shut down its 737 Max production lines late last year after experiencing the toughest year in company history.
Boeing has suffered along with the broader aviation industry as travel bans have slowed new bookings. Last week Goldman Sachs analysts predicted a 7 percent decline in air traffic this year that would prompt many airlines to defer purchases of new planes."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/its-over-biden-is-presumptive-nominee/,The Washington Post,It’s over. Biden is the presumptive nominee,"Former vice president Joe Biden did not just beat Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Florida and Illinois; he obliterated him by margins rarely seen in a presidential primary (because the loser inevitably gets out before he is humiliated week after week).
In Florida, Biden leads by an astounding margin of approximately 62 percent to 23 percent, with more than 90 percent of the vote reporting. In pre-election polling (conducted in lieu of exit polling), Biden won whites by a margin of 66 percent to 23 percent and by a stunning 75 to 18 percent among African Americans. As he has in previous contests, Biden won women by an overwhelming margin (66 percent to 25 percent).
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, turnout in Florida increased from 1.7 million voters in the 2016 primary to an estimated 1.85 million. Voters’ level of determination and enthusiasm to turn out for Biden should terrify Republicans.
Just after the polls closed in Illinois, the race was called for Biden, indicating another massive victory. There, Biden won among white college graduates 58 to 37 percent; among white non-college graduates by 63 to 31 percent. Working-class voters, college-educated voters, white and blacks are turning out in droves for Biden.
With a total of 441 delegates to be awarded among the three states that voted on Tuesday, Biden will in all likelihood wind up with a lead close to 300 delegates when the night is over. Biden crossed the halfway point to the 1,991 delegates needed to secure the nomination before Arizona’s polls closed at 10 p.m. Eastern time, and there is no reason to believe the results will be any less decisive there than the tallies in Florida and Illinois.
During his speech Tuesday night, Biden spoke in somber tones, his green tie a reminder that — oh yes! — this was St. Patrick’s Day, celebrated nowhere due to the pandemic. He spoke once more as if he were president, expressing empathy for those affected and appreciation for poll workers who both protected citizens’ health and our democracy. He calmly ticked off the components of his broad coalition. Then, as though Sanders had already conceded, he thanked Sanders and his supporters for making a difference and moving the conversation forward in the party. He said: “I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president, is to unify this party and unify this nation.”
His call for unity at a time of great anxiety and uncertainty was reminiscent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s fireside chats. Speaking softly — but confidently — he emphasized that both our leaders and individual Americans will get us through this ordeal.
There is near-universal recognition on the Democratic side, from Biden supporters and those who favored other candidates, as well as pollsters and operatives, that the Democratic primary is effectively over. Biden’s lead is insurmountable, and there is no conceivable mechanism by which Sanders might turn the tide. (There are no additional debates planned, for example.)
Sanders would be likely to draw anger for dragging out a primary process, compelling millions of people to leave their homes to vote and soliciting money. The party faces unique challenges, including the need to plan for a possible virtual convention and the conversion of the entire country to a vote-by-mail system. Biden should be able to access the apparatus of the Democratic National Committee, shift focus and begin to wage a general-election campaign right now.
It is far from clear what purpose Sanders serves by staying in the race. Each week, he is demonstrating his lack of support within the primary, diminishing his favored narrative that the party has moved left to embrace his democratic socialism. He has had his chance over nearly a dozen debates to make his case on the issues.
Sanders once said that when it became evident he could not win, he would get out. It has been clear for weeks now that Biden will be the nominee. His supporters might be enthralled by conspiracy theories to explain his losses, but Sanders should behave like an adult. He should behave as graciously as Biden did Tuesday night."

Lipinski loses to insurgent Marie Newman in high-profile Democratic primary rematch,"Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.), one of the last antiabortion Democrats in Congress, lost his bid for renomination to a ninth term Tuesday to a more liberal challenger, business executive and activist Marie Newman.
The race had been closely watched as a test of whether a socially conservative Democrat could maintain support among the party’s base in a solid blue seat — and whether the dwindling number of Democratic lawmakers opposing abortion would be further culled by primary voters.
While Lipinski won support from trade unions and some business groups, key national advocacy groups and liberal activist networks coalesced behind Newman as a better match for a district that preferred Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race by 15 percentage points over Donald Trump.
With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Newman held a roughly 3,800-vote lead — about four percentage points. The Associated Press declared Newman the winner shortly after midnight.
“I am bursting with pride and gratitude for the amazing coalition that helped bring about much needed change in our district,” Newman tweeted. “We are going to work together to lower health care costs, to fight climate change, and to build an economy that works for everyone.”
Lipinski, who is the first member of Congress to lose a renomination bid in the 2020 election cycle, declined to concede in a posting to his campaign Facebook account: “It is very close. We may have to wait overnight or into the morning for the final vote count.”
The election was upended in its closing phases by the coronavirus pandemic, with both candidates canceling their election night parties and encouraging voters to cast early ballots if possible rather than risk an in-person visit to polling places Tuesday.
The race was a rematch of the 2018 Democratic primary in the 3rd Congressional District, which is anchored in the working-class neighborhoods of Chicago’s South Side but stretches westward along the Des Plaines River into more affluent suburbs.
Lipinski won a two-point victory in the last primary by marshaling voters in Chicago precincts to overcome Newman’s strength in the suburbs before securing an easy victory in the general election. A year later, Newman announced she would try again.
Lipinski’s unapologetic antiabortion views — and Newman’s outspoken support for abortion rights — had been the dominant topic in a district that is heavily Democratic but also has a socially conservative strain rooted in the largely Catholic ethnic communities of Chicago.
“I am pro-life — there’s no question about that,” he said at a candidate forum aired by WTTW-TV last week. “Most people do not believe we should have abortion on demand up until birth; that, I believe, is an extreme position, and that is something I do not support. But I think the majority of people don’t support that.”
Newman, in the forum, said her views were simply more “in alignment” with her district, and she has sought to expand her message to an embrace of a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health-care system — and noting that Lipinski was one of a handful of Democrats who opposed the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.
Besides Lipinski, only Reps. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.), Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.) hold a rating over 25 percent on the National Right to Life Committee’s legislative scorecard.
Newman said she would “be a worker bee in Congress and get health care done” — an indirect shot at Lipinski’s argument that, with eight terms in Congress and a spot on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, he is better positioned to deliver for the district.
In a call with reporters arranged by Emily’s List last week, Newman said she was well positioned to succeed Tuesday where she fell short two years ago: “As you can imagine, your first time out, you learn a lot. And I did. There’s things that I didn’t do well and are now doing well.”
Both candidates raised and spent well over $1 million, according to campaign finance reports filed late last month, with Lipinski slightly outspending Newman. But Newman benefited from about $1.5 million in outside spending vs. the roughly $350,000 spent to elect Lipinski.
A super PAC affiliated with Emily’s List, which is an activist group devoted to electing female Democrats, led the charge with nearly $1 million, while NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Sierra Club and the Service Employees International Union also spent heavily for Newman. The plumbers and pipefitters trade union spent nearly $160,000 in support of Lipinski, with the National Association of Realtors and the bipartisan advocacy group No Labels also chipping in — as well as the Susan B. Anthony List, an antiabortion group that typically backs Republicans.
A third Democratic candidate, Rush Darwish, also raised significant amounts of money, reporting more than $780,000 in receipts as of last month.
Earlier this month, in another primary challenge to a conservative Democratic incumbent, Cuellar fended off attorney Jessica Cisneros, who also ran with the support of Emily’s List and liberal luminaries of the Democratic Party. That race was seen as an early test of whether moderate and conservative incumbents could withstand focused opposition from the left — including groups such as the Justice Democrats and prominent figures such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who successfully mounted her own insurgent campaign in 2018.
Newman had the backing of Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. But many Democrats placed the Lipinski race in a different category, given the amount of institutional support Newman had been able to amass — not only from Emily’s List and other major advocacy organizations, but also from Lipinski’s own colleagues in the Illinois House delegation, as well as a constellation of local officials including Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D).
And while Cuellar benefited from a last-minute fundraising visit from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), top Democrats largely kept their distance from Lipinski.
Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, canceled an appearance last year at a Chicago fundraiser for Lipinski after an uproar from liberal elements of the party."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/huawei-bonds-outshine-alibaba-tencent-in-downturn/2020/03/17/26dfa886-68a3-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,"Huawei Bonds Outshine Alibaba, Tencent in Downturn","Debt investors seem to believe that telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. could make a better bet in troubled times than its national peers, including China’s two biggest internet companies.
While the Bloomberg Barclays Index of high-yield U.S.-dollar Chinese bonds has dropped 6.2% over the past month, Huawei’s 2026 debt has climbed 1.2% and its  2027 notes are up 0.1%. That’s better short-term performance than both Tencent Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest social media company, and e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
At the heart of this relative optimism is the knowledge that while a private company, Huawei is cushioned from short-term consumer sentiment and economic shocks by its dominant domestic position. It’s the leading supplier of equipment used in communications networks, and the largest vendor of smartphones. No matter what happens around the world, Huawei has a home market that still needs its gear as part of China’s strategically important, long-term 5G mobile rollout.
The same must-have factor doesn’t apply to the major internet companies, which are both highly reliant on short-term consumer spending. Debt investors are pricing that difference. The price of Tencent bonds due in 2026 has climbed 0.5% over the same period, while Alibaba bonds for 2027 are down 3.4%. 
It’s worth noting that Tencent and Alibaba are both rated A+ by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, the agency’s third-highest rank, which means they’re part of the investment-grade indexes. A Bloomberg Barclays index for U.S. dollar investment grade debt has climbed 0.5%. Huawei’s bonds aren’t rated, according to Bloomberg data, and are considered high-yield, which puts them in indexes under that category.
We’ve observed debt investors’ underlying belief in Huawei before, despite the company facing significant opposition from foreign governments such as the U.S. that deem its equipment a security risk. In October, I noted that four different series of U.S. dollar bonds continued to march upward even as Washington sought to stop Huawei’s communications gear from being used in global 5G mobile networks. In fact, it took the global spread of the Covid19 coronavirus to end a 10-month bull run on Huawei bonds, which peaked on March 9.
Huawei’s shares aren’t listed, which means we can’t assess equity sentiment. But the view toward Alibaba is clear. Its shares are down 18.6% over the past month as investors come to realize that even China’s most prominent names won’t be able to dodge a slowdown in the global economy. Tencent’s shares haven’t fared much better, dropping 15.1%.
Having confined themselves largely to their home market, Alibaba and Tencent managed to dodge the trade war with the U.S. and growing concerns over the security of Chinese technology. As a result, sales and profits continue to climb. Huawei, on the other hand, has had its global ambitions thwarted over such fears, hurting revenue. Yet the longer-term picture remains intact because China is determined to build out the world’s most-advanced mobile network, and it can’t do so without Huawei. For bond investors, that translates to a relatively good chance it will pay its bills."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/18/feds-using-all-its-emergency-tools-prevent-economic-disaster-here-are-4-things-know/,The Washington Post,The Fed’s using all its emergency tools to prevent economic disaster. Here are 4 things to know.,"With the coronavirus pandemic hitting the U.S. and world economies hard, the Federal Reserve has taken emergency steps to stabilize financial markets and lower borrowing costs. Moving days before a previously scheduled monetary policy meeting, the Fed’s emergency measures — including two interest rate cuts in the past two weeks — aim to support the economy and mitigate a financial crisis, both here and abroad.
Here’s what you need to know.
1. The Fed quickly moved into crisis-fighting mode
Last Thursday, the Fed announced it would offer $1.5 trillion in short-term loans to push cash into money markets. Then, over the weekend, it dropped interest rates to zero and resumed buying bonds, both efforts last used during the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2010. The Fed then announced it would launch a $10 billion special fund to help keep credit flowing to households and business. This weekend, the Fed also revved up its “currency swap lines” with five major foreign central banks: the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank. The move makes U.S. dollars available overseas at cheap rates, as the global battle with the covid-19 pandemic grows increasingly severe.
Or, to put it more colloquially, the Fed fired a bazooka. Dropping rates to zero means that the Fed is exhausting its normal monetary policy discretion, since Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell has indicated that the central bank is unlikely to lower rates below zero. By resuming bond buying and reaching for swap lines, the Fed has taken its Great Recession playbook off the shelf to deploy against the pandemic’s economic consequences.
2. Reaching for ‘swap lines’ suggests global financial threats
Enhancing the swap lines signals that extraordinary steps may be needed to stabilize the global economy. Swap lines ensure a sufficient supply of U.S. dollars in global financial markets, where the greenback is by far the most used currency. When the economy is healthy, currency swaps are seldom needed; when access to dollars is scarce, swap lines provide an important lifeline. During the Great Recession, the Fed extended swap lines to 14 foreign monetary authorities — and added, at the peak, nearly $600 billion in dollar liquidity into the world’s financial system.
Here’s how swap lines work. Swap agreements involve two transactions between the Federal Reserve and a counterparty central bank. In the first transaction, a foreign central bank sells an amount of its currency to the Fed in exchange for dollars, at the market rate. The Fed holds this foreign currency in the counterparty’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a specified period. The foreign central bank obtaining dollars loans them to financial institutions in its jurisdiction in times of stress.
At the end of the specified period, which ranges from an overnight exchange to as much as 90 days, the second transaction unwinds the first. The foreign central bank buys back its currency from the Fed in exchange for dollars at the same market exchange rate. By drawing on a Fed swap line, the foreign central bank pays interest to the Fed equal to the amount it earns on its domestic operations, at a market-based rate. Thus, this is not a “bailout” but a liquidity “swap” to ensure access to those who need cash in particular currencies.
3. Domestic and international considerations motivate these actions
Several international and domestic dynamics shape these global currency policies.
First, as Daniel McDowell shows here, the Fed used these “international lender of last resort” powers during the global financial crisis as a defensive maneuver: Opening swap lines protected the U.S. economy from spillover threats, like bank defaults, from foreign economies facing financial difficulties. In a globalized economy, stabilizing global currency markets bolsters the U.S. economy, improving the Fed’s ability to meet its congressional mandate to maximize employment and stabilize prices. The Federal Reserve’s announcement this weekend reiterated this mandate.
Second, not every country that wants a swap gets one. Aditi Sahasrabuddhe shows that central bankers are more likely to grant a swap to countries that share the U.S. preference for greater capital openness, with an eye to reinforcing economic alliances. So far the Fed has excluded some economies such as Singapore and South Korea that received swaps in 2008 but do not currently have standing Fed swap lines; unlike in 2008, these countries do not currently enjoy leading roles in global economic governance institutions. What’s more, during the pandemic, capital is rapidly fleeing these and other large and emerging markets, as investors search for safer havens to park their money. The Fed may later expand the swap program to include these and other economies, as some argue it should.
Third, Kindred Winecoff emphasizes that because most international trade and financial transactions are invoiced in dollars, access to dollars is essential for global commerce. This makes the Fed the most important global economic player: Only the Fed can make dollars available to foreign central banks to facilitate lending in dollars abroad. The Fed’s swap lines empower U.S. policymakers to influence the global economy in ways that are congruent with U.S. interests.
4. The Fed’s actions might be a double-edged sword
The Fed probably sought to calm financial markets by moving before markets opened Monday morning, given last week’s extreme volatility. But the Fed’s aggressive actions also signaled that the financial system is more at risk than many realized. Fiscal and monetary authorities will probably have to provide more public support for the world economy.
That may be why markets fell precipitously after the Fed’s actions, prompting the South Korean finance ministry to pledge “swift and stern stabilization measures” then echoed by policymakers around the world. What’s more, several governments — including Australia, India, South Korea and the United Kingdom — suggested an emergency meeting of the Group of 20 governance group might be needed.
Parallels to the 2008 financial collapse abound. By once again deploying its crisis tool kit, Fed officials indicated that the pandemic could drive the global economy into a more severe shock than anything seen in more than a decade."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/hsbc-falls-into-a-safe-pair-of-hands-at-last/2020/03/18/2a2cabb4-68f4-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,HSBC Falls Into a Safe Pair of Hands at Last,"Noel Quinn’s appointment as chief executive officer of HSBC Holdings Plc was all but inevitable. Europe’s biggest bank did itself no favors by taking seven months to make the decision. It’s good that it has acted at last: No lender the size of HSBC should be comfortable heading into a financial crisis with a caretaker CEO.
HSBC approached at least three outsiders for the CEO role after ousting John Flint in August, leaving Quinn in charge on an interim basis. Citigroup Inc. veterans Stephen Bird and James Forese, and Unicredit SpA’s Jean Pierre Mustier all ruled themselves out of contention. Flint was axed after only 18 months in the role, having failed to satisfy Chairman Mark Tucker that he was doing enough to revive growth at the London-based and Asia-focused bank.
The frustrated CEO search led to the bizarre situation of having an interim chief present the bank’s most radical overhaul in years, a plan that includes as many as 35,000 job cuts and a $100 billion reduction in gross assets. No outsider would be scrambling to lead the bank after such big decisions had already been taken, leaving Quinn the likely pick, as I wrote at the time. Exactly one month later, HSBC has come to the same conclusion.
As a 33-year veteran of HSBC, Quinn represents continuity and stability. Both are welcome. The landscape looks vastly different than when Tucker became the first outsider to helm the bank on on Oct 1, 2018. Former CEO Stuart Gulliver, Flint’s predecessor, had already started the tough work of trimming of one of the world’s most bloated banks. HSBC had cut tens of thousands of jobs, exited at least 80 businesses, and was back in analysts’ good books. Interest rates were rising in Hong Kong, its single largest market, as the U.S. Federal Reserve moved to normalize policy.
Two-and-a-half years later, the coronavirus pandemic is making a mockery of forecasts of how the world would look. Interest rates are back at zero, credit markets are tightening and dollar funding is freezing up in an uncomfortable echo of the 2008 credit crisis. The Fed already began cutting borrowing cuts late last year as the U.S. economy weakened, hitting net interest margins of banks across the world.
If the financial turmoil unleashed by the virus proves as severe as the crisis of 12 years ago, then experience will be at a premium. Quinn has the advantage of having been with HSBC through that period. Tucker’s banking experience, by contrast, is limited to a couple of years at HBOS Plc in the early 2000s, a non-executive role at the Bank of England and a period on the board of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
With the global economy heading into recession, no bank will be left unscathed. HSBC said last month it could see an additional $600 million losses if the virus outbreak extends to the second half of the year. It is at least in a stronger position to ride out the crunch than many banks. HSBC is liquid, with plenty of deposits, especially in its Hong Kong. Its mortgage loan book in Hong Kong looks secure, with the city’s real estate market having proved resilient so far. And its size and geographic spread ensure access to dollar funding.
Amid these challenging conditions, Quinn’s appointment has come in less than ideal fashion, with his extended probation making clear that the board harbored doubts about his suitability. The next few months will be a test of his safe hands. He won’t be the only HSBC leader to be tested. After such a clumsy search for its next CEO, investors may feel that Tucker deserves scrutiny, too."

Pledges by Germany and France to guarantee hundreds of billions in bank loans boosted the global tally. France will guarantee up to 300 billion euros ($333 billion) of bank loans to prop up businesses most hurt from the virus outbreak, while Germany earlier said as much as 550 billion euros was available from state bank KfW.
Some governments have allocated new money for cash handouts and medical care, while several are planning targeted measures like tax breaks and loan support. Bank guarantees have started to take up an increasing share of the aid.
Here’s a look at what governments have pledged so far, generally in order of their announcements:"
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/18/biden-wants-woman-his-running-mate-val-demings-could-be-one/,The Washington Post,Biden wants a woman as his running mate. Val Demings could be the one.,"“If what happened on Super Tuesday is any indication of what will happen in Florida’s primary, I think that we’re gonna be in really good shape,” Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) told me during an interview last week. She was right. Despite disruptions due to the coronavirus, Florida saw record turnout that powered the 40-point victory of former vice president Joe Biden, whom Demings endorsed.
Demings wouldn’t engage in direct political talk when I asked her about Biden’s remaining rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), especially given his comments about the late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. Demings’s reticence was unsurprising since we were sitting in her Capitol Hill office, where such talk runs afoul of the rules. But she found a way to get her point across.
“I certainly will not guess about what Sen. Sanders said or what he meant to say. But what I do know is that several people who live in a very diverse state were upset by those comments,” Demings, a former police chief in Orlando, told me when I asked whether Sanders’s praise for Castro’s literacy programs was damaging in the Sunshine State. “We’re in the middle of a race. We’re going to let Floridians decide.”
Floridians will have to make another decision come November between the Democratic nominee and President Trump, who is making a concerted effort to court Latino voters in Florida. Demings isn’t worried.
“My husband likes to say the best indicator of future performance is to look at past performance,” she said of her husband, Jerry Demings, mayor of Orange County, Fla., who has also served as Orlando police chief, the first black person to hold the position. “Donald Trump ... has been a divider. He has said racist, derogatory things about people of color long before he entered into politics. He didn’t change his spots when he entered into politics. And certainly, he has now become the divider in chief. I don’t know whether he thinks people of color, black and brown people, are not paying attention, or maybe he believes that we have short memories. But what’s etched in my memory is this man who has a very inhumane policy of separating families at the southern border.”
The congresswoman added: “He can run all the ads he wants to. It does not erase reality, those pictures that are etched in our brains of his inhumane treatment and derogatory remarks about black and brown people.”
Demings was most animated when talking about the president. Not surprising given her role in Trump’s impeachment. She is a member of the House Intelligence Committee, which investigated whether the president withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations into Biden and his son. Demings is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which used the intelligence committee’s findings and its own hearings to bring two articles of impeachment against Trump. And she was one of the seven impeachment managers selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to argue the case against the president before the Senate.
“The American people have entrusted their hopes and dreams into [Trump’s] hands, and he has abused that authority and abused it to try to cheat in the 2020 election,"" Demings said, adding, ""He tried to cheat to win, and then when he was caught, he used that same authority to obstruct our ability to investigate.”
As a result of her role during all those hearings and the 20-day impeachment trial in the Senate, Demings has found herself the subject of speculation about a potential vice-presidential nomination. Her name joins Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams on the list of African American women being talked about for the No. 2 job. When I asked Abrams whether she wanted to be considered for vice president during an interview in December, Abrams was direct.
“I’m a black woman who’s in a conversation about possibly being second in command to the leader of the free world, and I will not diminish my ambition or the ambition of any other women of color by saying that’s not something I’d be willing to do,” Abrams said to applause.
When I asked Demings whether she wanted to run for vice president, the two-term member of Congress also leaned in: “I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor. I grew up poor, black and female in the South, someone who was told a lot of times that I wasn’t the right color or gender. But my mother pushed me and said, ‘No, you can make it. If you work hard and play by the rules, you can be anything you wanna be and do anything you wanna do,' ” Demings said. “So the fact that my name is being called in such a special way for such an important position during such a critical time, it’s such an honor.”"
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/the-uks-virus-stimulus-is-bold-with-holes/2020/03/18/0fc7edc6-6933-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,Boris Johnson’s Virus Response Keeps Getting Bigger,"From Donald Trump to Emmanuel Macron to Boris Johnson, world leaders have rushed to echo Mario Draghi’s words as the European Central Bank prepared to deal with the financial crisis: We will do “whatever it takes.” And yet there is no consensus on what exactly is required — not on the magnitude of relief, not on the timing of different measures, not on how to target and deliver it. 
If size is mainly what matters, Britain has so far been out in front. Trump may be planning a $1.2 trillion relief package. But the one that U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced Tuesday — 350 billion pounds ($424 billion) in loans, grants and tax relief — is 1.7 times larger on a per capita basis.
The biggest difference between the as-yet theoretical Trump plan — which includes direct cash payments to individuals — and the Johnson-Sunak plan is the share of loans versus grants. Small and medium-sized businesses can tap the new Business Interruption Loan Scheme (announced in the recent budget) and smaller businesses can borrow up to 5 million pounds interest-free for six months, with most of the loan amounts guaranteed by the Exchequer to encourage continued bank lending.
Larger companies will have access to the new Covid Corporate Financing Facility from the Bank of England, a temporary scheme by which the BOE buys short-term debt issued by companies with terms that the Bank says will be near those that prevailed in the market before Covid-19 hit. There’s also the question of how long a loss-making company can stay afloat under U.K. company law. 
The main point of going bold is as much psychological as financial — to convince businesses and consumers that the economic fallout will be contained and support will be provided. If people aren’t panicked about losing their jobs, they are more likely to follow instructions to self-isolate. If businesses have confidence that they can ride out the crisis, they are less likely to lay off workers. And yet while the generosity of the package is clearly important, so is the targeting and the transmission mechanism. In that respect, the U.K. still has a lot to do.
There is some direct relief in Sunak’s new measures. U.K. businesses in the hospitality, leisure and retail industries will not have to pay so-called business rates, or the tax on properties used for commercial purposes, for the next 12 months. The Treasury has given companies more time to pay their tax bills and waived the usual 3.5% annual interest on deferred tax payments. For businesses in those sectors valued at less than 51,000 pounds, there will be cash grants of up to 25,000 pounds to tap.
And yet these may end up building a tent to fend off an avalanche. The targeted aid reflects the fact that the U.K. is largely a services economy, but other industries outside the three most-protected sectors will be hit. A company that is facing a long period of collapsed revenue and no immediate prospect of recovery is going to lay off workers before it will take on debt that it will eventually have to repay. None of the government’s measures are going to convince them otherwise.
The Johnson-Sunak plan, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn noted in Parliament Wednesday, also does little for those on low pay, the self-employed and other vulnerable workers. That includes those in the gig economy, which now employs nearly 5 million people. Many will lose their income during this period and yet have no access to sick pay or other relief.
Even for those in regular work, Britain’s mandatory sick pay is low by European standards — only 94.25 pounds per week. That is too little to support many households. And while the poorest can be helped through the welfare system, the bureaucracy is onerous. At present it takes five weeks before support is received and there are many hoops to jump through first.
Finally, while there is mortgage payment relief for homeowners (which is straightforward to administer through the banking sector), there was still a need for measures to keep those in private rental accommodation from being turfed out (trickier to implement). In the decade to 2017, the number of households in the rental sector increased by 63% to 4.5 million. And while they tend to be largely younger households, at least 16% of them have members over the age of 45. On Wednesday, Johnson announced he would introduce legislation to prevent evictions due to coronavirus consequences — one sign of how we are likely to see frequent changes, especially once new emergency powers are granted.
The current U.K. package amounts to an impressive 15% of GDP (compared to about 6% for Trump’s moves) and far more than the 45 billion euros ($49 billion) of measures announced in France. But even more measures to address these gaps are likely still to come along, with more from the Bank of England. Anticipation for just that has helped send yields on U.K. 10-year government debt to the highest levels they’ve seen since January.
The U.K. is not yet considering a basic-income type experiment of the kind Trump is pushing — putting cash directly in people’s hands — but such handouts have the benefit of being immediate and, well, liquid. Sunak may yet have to think again about whether a loan-based program targeting specific sectors will do enough. 
Welcome to the Age of the State. As my colleague Pankaj Mishra has written, government is going to be a much more central part of economic life for some time to come and that will have all sorts of consequences. How quickly the U.K. economy recovers from this crisis depends not just on how long it takes to find a vaccine or stop the virus’s spread, but whether the measures crafted now provide a sound enough floor for consumers and businesses so they can recover once the avalanche passes."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/18/give-bernie-sanders-his-due/,The Washington Post,Give Bernie Sanders his due,"After losses in all three primaries that took place Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” according to his campaign manager. “Assessing” usually means that the candidate is trying to determine when and how to drop out of the race.
So let us give Bernie Sanders his due.
Sanders was not my favorite candidate among the two dozen contenders for the Democratic nomination, or even in my top three or four. But he has done extraordinary things. He helped reshape the Democratic Party, widened the policy debate in America and inspired millions of followers to a feverish devotion — despite lacking in the kind of charisma we normally associate with successful politicians. It is hardly what you could have expected from a rumpled, grumpy 70-something Jewish socialist.
I’ve been critical of Sanders, even as I was sympathetic to most of his ideas. His theory of governing is grossly inadequate: He had a long slate of plans that would require sweeping legislation, but an almost absurd answer on how any of it would pass Congress. He said his grass-roots movement would be so powerful that it would force even Republicans — even Mitch McConnell! — to vote for programs like Medicare-for-all and free college, measures they find utterly abhorrent.
I suspect that Sanders always understood how ridiculous that idea was but nevertheless decided that repeating it was necessary to avoid compromising his position before he ever took office, and to keep popular mobilization at the center of his political project.
He might not have gotten the chance to test his movement’s ability to make laws. But he proved that you could run a presidential campaign without high-dollar fundraisers, raising over $130 million with contributions from nearly a million and a half Americans. None of his opponents (setting aside the self-financed billionaires) came close on either measure.
And he can take as much credit as anyone — probably more — for the Democratic Party’s movement to the left. Positions that he championed, such as a $15-an-hour minimum wage, went from outside the mainstream to near consensus within the party, in large part because of his advocacy.
Yes, some of the left’s most morally obtuse people rallied behind Sanders, people who draw sustenance from misogynistic Twitter pile-ons and genuinely believe that reelecting President Trump is preferable to seeing a centrist Democrat like Joe Biden occupy the White House for a while.
But they were always a small minority of Sanders’s supporters. He attracted and inspired young idealists, and people willing to invest their time in political organizing, and people who felt that politics and policy could be profoundly different if we simply decided they could be.
That may have been Sanders’s greatest contribution: His insistence that the moral and political compromises we have made and continue to make were not inevitable and ought be questioned. At the very least, they should be examined and understood, and he forced those who assented to them to justify the decisions they had made.
If there’s anything that marks Sanders’s career, it’s the unwavering consistency of his beliefs (with a concession to pragmatism here or there, as on gun rights). You can argue that too much consistency is a problem, and while I’m an advocate of well-considered flip-flopping, Sanders’s unwavering commitment to a set of principles and policy ideas made him a particularly effective advocate for those ideas.
Sanders’s arguments are radical in the sense of getting down to the root of things, always drawing us back to fundamental questions. You may be skeptical about the financing for his health-care plan, but no advocate of a public option, let alone our nightmarish status quo, had a good answer for his oft-repeated question of why the United States is the only highly industrialized democracy that doesn’t guarantee health coverage to every person as a human right.
Sanders has been asking that question (along with many others) for decades, but it was only his two strong presidential campaigns that gave him the platform to force his ideas in front of the entire public, to all of our benefit. He didn’t invent single payer or free public college, but never before in American history have they been the topic of so much serious consideration.
When his 2016 campaign ended, Sanders kept right on going; I’m sure he never entertained any doubt that he’d run again in 2020. But there won’t be a 2024 campaign even if Biden were to lose in the fall (Sanders will be 83 by the next election, too old even for him). Knowing that, he’s surely reluctant to turn out the lights on this campaign.
Although I recently argued that Sanders should stay in the race as long as he wants, there are good reasons for him to bow out now, not least of which is the risk of people gathering at polling places and transmitting the novel coronavirus if the primaries go on. But I’m guessing he knows that once he’s no longer a presidential candidate, his ability to command attention and wield influence will decline precipitously.
After this, he won’t be just one of a hundred senators — he’ll still be able to get on the Sunday shows and get attention for himself — but maintaining a movement after a campaign shuts down is an extraordinarily difficult task, let alone successfully mobilizing that movement to shape the course of events.
Which means that Sanders has reached the apex of his career and his cause. It might not have gotten him to the White House, but it did more than just about anyone thought it would."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/opec-only-faces-one-choice-in-china-virus-crisis/2020/02/02/20cb6482-4592-11ea-99c7-1dfd4241a2fe_story.html,The Washington Post,OPEC Only Faces One Choice in China Virus Crisis,"Oil producers are starting to feel the impact of  the new coronavirus as it continues to spread, and they need to take drastic action to head off a potentially devastating impact on prices. The world’s biggest producers face two key questions, how long will it last and how severe will the consequences will be? The answers are of course still elusive, but the OPEC+ group of nations will need to weigh some educated guesses soon.
The initial reaction resembles that of an agitated anthill, with frantic scurrying in all directions amid an apparent lack of coordination. The final days of last week saw calls for their next meeting, scheduled for the first week of March, to be brought forward, perhaps by as much as a month. That move appeared to be driven by Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, but initially found little support from the largest of the non-OPEC members of the wider group — Russia. 
One of the key challenges facing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its big oil-producing counterparts is that they have no idea how big a problem they face. At this point, estimates of the epidemic’s impact on oil demand vary widely. S&P Global Platts sees global oil demand falling by an “almost catastrophic” 2.6 million barrels a day in February and 2 million barrels in March in its worst-case scenario. No wonder producers are in a panic.
China is, by far, the biggest market for OPEC+ crude exports, with the big Persian Gulf producers particularly vulnerable. Tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show that almost a quarter of all shipments out of the region last year went to China. Add in the other three big Asian buyers — India, Japan and South Korea — and that share rises to two-thirds.
It is difficult to overestimate the importance of China to global oil balances. Earlier this month, OPEC’s own forecasts showed the world’s most populous country accounting for more than a quarter of all the growth in oil demand worldwide this year. The International Energy Agency saw it playing an even bigger role, with almost 40% of incremental demand in China. The word “virus” didn’t appear in either of those agencies’ monthly reports.
The virus will not affect all oil products equally. With travel bans and an extended Lunar New Year holiday, transport fuels will be hit hardest. Gasoline, jet fuel and gas/diesel oil were expected to account for 55% of China’s oil demand this year and make up almost 60% of the growth.
It is these products that will be hardest hit — and not just in China. Flight bans to China by many airlines, including British Airways Plc and Delta Air Lines Inc., and travel restrictions on Chinese tourists will have a knock-on effect on fuel use elsewhere, particularly in nearby countries that are favored destinations for tour groups.
And then there’s all of the other knock-on effects. Lower demand from end users means lower demand from refiners. Major state-owned Chinese refiners may cut run rates below 70% to cope with falling demand, industry consultant JLC said in a note, while operating rates at privately-owned independent refineries in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong may be cut to below 50%.
Even before the new coronavirus began to hit oil consumption, the swing producers that make up OPEC+ were in trouble. The hard-won output deal they reached in December failed to deliver any significant cuts to total output levels, and prices have drifted lower. The deal’s currently scheduled to expire at the end of March. Simply extending the cuts will do nothing to improve the worsening balances between supply and demand, and therefore it will take more to light a fire under oil prices. Deeper cuts will be much harder to agree — Russia, for one, is against them — but that’s the only thing that will lift prices in the face of a Chinese slowdown.
There are already signs that slowdown is happening. Sales of Latin American oil cargoes to China ground to a halt last week. Persian Gulf producers are starting to receive preliminary nominations from their customers of how much oil they want in March, and that will indicate whether Chinese refiners seek to reduce the volumes they lift from export terminals in the region.
Non-OPEC countries — led by the U.S., Norway, Brazil and new producer Guyana — were already expected to add two extra barrels for every additional one consumed worldwide this year, squeezing OPEC. The loss of much of China’s oil demand growth will crush the producer group under the weight of falling oil prices, unless, collectively, they cut their output further."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/18/trump-stock-market-dow/,The Washington Post,"Trump took credit during Wall Street’s highs, but what about its lowest of lows?","Financial experts warned President Trump against taking credit for Wall Street’s extraordinary bull run since the beginning of his administration. The foremost reason is that commanders in chief have little actual control over what happens in the markets.
From a purely political standpoint, presidents have tended to avoid claiming too much credit for the markets because stocks that go up inevitably come down. That’s a lesson Trump may be learning this week: On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average came within 75 points of his Inauguration Day close.
Nearly all of the Trump-era gains, in other words, have been erased.
On Jan. 20, 2017, the Dow closed at 19,827. It soared over the next three years, peaking at 29,551 on Feb. 12 of this year. Within a span of weeks, the Dow plummeted roughly 10,000 points — nearly one-third of its value — as the coronavirus crisis has played out. On Wednesday, it shed another 1,334 points to settle at 19,899.
By comparison, according to investment research platform Macrotrends, the Dow was up 65 percent at the same point in President Barack Obama’s first term. Under President Bill Clinton, it had climbed 69 percent. The only president since Ronald Reagan to see worse market performance at a comparable point was George W. Bush, who was leading the nation through the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Nearly all of these shifts are due to factors outside a president’s control. There are well-documented cases in which a market move can be unequivocally tied to the commander in chief’s actions. One of the most recent happened last Wednesday night, when Trump’s address to the nation caused Dow futures to drop “in real time with virtually each word Trump uttered,” as Philip Rucker, Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey recently put it in The Washington Post.
It is also worth noting that the stock market is a highly imperfect metric for the economy overall. Fully half of Americans own no stocks whatsoever, not even through such retirement accounts as a 401(k). Recent research has shown the media’s market obsession creates a portrait of the economy skewed toward the interests of the rich, leaving us with a poor understanding of how middle-class Americans actually are doing.
The reality is the rich are running much of the show. The median U.S. senator is a multimillionaire. Billionaires and the firms they own have an outsize influence on the economy, and market troubles like the ones we’re experiencing now have ripple effects that trickle down to decisions about who gets hired and who gets laid off."

In a hospital intensive care unit, life-saving ventilators can help a patient survive by pumping oxygen into the impaired lungs. But what if thousands more people need hospital beds and ventilators than are available?
That is the nightmare scenario facing the United States and other nations in the pandemic. In Italy, doctors are having to make painful choices about which patients get treatment. President Trump told governors in a conference call on Monday morning, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves. We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.”
That was shortsighted. The federal government ought to be doing everything in its power to make sure the worst-case scenario does not happen. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, has proposed that the United States “needs a wartime mobilization” to boost the supply of ventilators. We’d settle for even a decent peacetime mobilization. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump took a welcome step in that direction, invoking the Defense Production Act, which allows him to order companies to shift production toward essential items in a crisis. We hope he will use it robustly.
Whether the worst case will happen is not yet known. But an epidemiological study published Monday by Imperial College, London, focusing on Britain and the United States, makes the point that all the non-pharmaceutical measures now being proposed — social distancing of the entire population, case isolation, household quarantine if one member is sick and school closures, a so-called suppression strategy — will have to be undertaken to reduce the stress on hospitals. If a less intense strategy is followed, the study warns, it would result in an “8-fold higher peak demand on critical care beds over and above the available surge capacity” in both Britain and the United States.
Hospital beds are a major worry. In another study, published in pre-print and not yet peer-reviewed, Eric S. Toner of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins and colleagues calculated that, using data from the Wuhan, China, outbreak, the demand for critical-care treatment at the peak of the pandemic might be 259 people per million. Excluding the Department of Veterans Affairs system, there are 46,500 medical intensive care unit beds in the United States, or 178 per million, with 70 to 80 percent of them already occupied on any given day. Without any changes, that means that in an average metropolitan area of 1 million, there are only 36 to 53 empty, staffed intensive care beds to meet a need that might be 259.
To alleviate the shortage, hospitals will have to take drastic rationing action, postpone other treatments and seek additional space. And even then it is not clear there will be sufficient capacity. In the case of ventilators, too, there are 62,000 immediately available and 99,000 that could be pulled out in an emergency, according to Forbes. But that might still not be sufficient, depending on the size of the pandemic.
By acting now, we may avert a hospital catastrophe. But that likely will require Mr. Trump to use the legal authority he invoked to add supplies through wartime-style mobilization. “Do it yourself” won’t do."

The biggest U.S. bank also told some branch workers -- including advisers and small-business bankers -- that they can work from home starting Thursday, according to a memo to staff from Thasunda Duckett, who runs the consumer branch network.
The closures are distributed across the country and aren’t necessarily concentrated in areas that have been Covid-19 hot spots, JPMorgan spokeswoman Trish Wexler said. The bank has prioritized keeping open branches that have drive-thrus or teller partition glass.
“Chase is open for business in every one of our markets, with bankers in our branches ready to help customers across our entire footprint,” Wexler said in an emailed statement. “Our temporarily smaller footprint will allow us to provide appropriate coverage in every market we serve.”
Many of JPMorgan’s worldwide employees who work from corporate offices were asked late Friday to start working from home this week. The previous directives didn’t apply to branch workers or operations staff, many of whom are in roles that can’t be done at home.
The roughly 4,000 branches that remain open will operate under shorter hours during the week. In most cases of a branch closure, another JPMorgan location is within walking distance, Wexler said.

The decision by An Bord Planeala, a national-level planning appeals commission, is a major setback for one of Trump’s premier foreign properties. Trump International Golf Links Doonbeg, as with the two Trump courses in Scotland, are owned outright by the Trump family business and represent an important investment for the company.
An inspector for the planning board warned in his report that the rock barrier the Trump Organization intended to build could “have a long term significant negative impact on landscape and visual quality” along a stretch of beach popular with tourists and famous for its natural beauty. The decision reverses an earlier approval by the county government.
The rejection comes at a time when the Trump Organization, like others in the tourism and hospitality industries, is suffering from closures and cancellations due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. It was unclear if the company can appeal the decision.
Erosion along this coastal stretch of County Clare, in southwestern Ireland, has been a problem for the Trump Organization for years. The course — which Trump bought in 2014 for $11.9 million — is perched at the edge of towering sand dunes that overlook a crescent beach. The ocean storm-surge can crest those dunes and undercut them from below.
Since Trump bought the course, two and a half greens have been washed away by storms, and another was moved inland to escape erosion, according to a golf course architect, Martin Hawtree, who was hired by Trump to make revisions to the course. The Trump club estimated as part of its sea wall application it is losing land at a rate of one meter per year. Staffers have used hay bales at times to shore up the dunes.
“Winter storms remain a constant threat to the coastal and normally most dramatic holes,” Hawtree wrote in an email to The Washington Post in October. “And those storms appear to be recurring at more frequent intervals.”
The Trump Organization’s consultants, as part of its application for the sea wall, warned that sea level rise caused by climate change — a concept that Trump the politician has disputed in the past — could increase the rate of dune erosion.
The company’s initial proposal — a nearly 2-mile-long, 15-foot-high rock wall at the base of the dunes — had been scaled back amid opposition from environmentalists and others.
The Trump Organization later proposed building two sections of what it calls “armourstone protection” — one 2,000 feet long, another 840 feet long — at points along the beach where the golf course was particularly vulnerable.
As part of its application, the Trump club warned that doing nothing would “bring the viability of the entire resort and its potential closure into question,” the Irish Times reported. With renovations, the Doonbeg resort has already cost Trump more than $40 million, and it has yet to turn a profit.
The Clare County Council approved that barrier plan in December 2017, but it was then appealed by several people, including environmentalists and a local surfing club, to the national planning board.
In rejecting the proposal on Wednesday, the national planning board noted that it was “not satisfied that the proposed development would not result in adverse effects on the physical structure, functionality and sediment supply of dune habitat.”
During a visit by a Washington Post reporter to Doonbeg last fall, residents were divided on the sea wall project. Several complained that a large rock barrier would destroy the aesthetics of the barren, windblown beach and the natural interplay of tide and sand.
“I would be totally and utterly horrified if a wall was built here,” said Rachel Meehan, as she was on one of her regular walks on the wide expanse of Doughmore Beach.
Meehan is a birdwatcher and a beachcomber who runs a shop where children can come and paint the bits of wood and stone she finds in the sand. She grew up in a seaside home where a couple times a year the waves would reach the house; it’s something one gets used living by the sea, she said. Her family has picnicked under the dunes for generations, and she sees the shifting of the sands as a natural dance that a pile of rocks would destroy.
“It’s like the fisherman out in their boats. You go with the wind. You go with the waves. You don’t fight it,” she said. “Trump should just build a very big wall in a circle with him in the middle of it.”
Others had embraced the proposal as a way to protect their livelihoods; in the rural area, the Trump resort is one of the largest employers, with more than 200 staff members.
Jenny Lynch, who lives next to the course, was afraid her own home could be washed away. She recalled one winter gale a few years back where the wind peeled off the roof of her greenhouse like the skin of an onion and knocked over her daughter.
“She was thrown down. She was six. But a sturdy six. I took her out of the Jeep and she just flew,” recalled Lynch.
Lynch, whose husband used to work as a greenskeeper at the course, said she knows Trump “drives people mad.”
“I don’t care whether it’s Trump, Genghis Khan, or whoever,” she said. “This is all we have to leave our children. And the sea’s going to take it away.”
Without a sea wall, some worried Trump could be driven out of Ireland. While the sea wall battle had dragged on for three years, the waves have been at work, noted John Flanagan, a farmer who lives near Trump’s course and wanted the sea wall approved.
“They have now taken three years of hills away,” said Flanagan, who is also the chairman of a local community and economic development group. “The golf course will get too narrow. And then Trump will have no choice but to leave.”"

There is hope that public health measures may succeed in halting the virus, the downward slide may be arrested — and normal activity may be restored — within a relatively short period. Meanwhile, however, the watchword of public and private institutions in financial matters must be forbearance.
To the extent possible, households and businesses, especially the poorest of the former and the smallest of the latter, should be allowed to postpone payments that would otherwise be due. As financial expert Mohamed A. El-Erian puts it in a sobering new Foreign Affairs article, generous forbearance can help “prevent liquidity problems from becoming solvency ones.”
The Trump administration has already announced a 90-day interest- and penalty-free delay in federal income tax payments, along with suspension of student loan interest payments. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) contributed Wednesday by instructing the two mortgage-finance agencies it regulates, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to suspend foreclosures and evictions for at least 60 days on the $5.5 trillion worth of mortgages they back, equal to nearly half the market. Importantly, this could benefit both homeowners and rental tenants in multifamily buildings backed by Fannie and Freddie.
The FHFA previously instructed Fannie and Freddie to extend up to 12 months’ worth of mortgage postponement to borrowers suffering hardship related to the coronavirus. That is not everyone: Borrowers who retain the wherewithal to meet their obligations can and should be encouraged and incentivized to do so, in order to husband public resources for the benefit of those who need them most. And many details of the FHFA’s directives remain to be worked out.
The general idea, however, is sound: By stabilizing family finances at their essential points of vulnerability — monthly mortgage and rent payments — forbearance will free up families’ cash for other needs, such as utilities and food. Obviously, this is not a total solution for those living paycheck to paycheck, much less those living in poverty. Still, it is worth noting that the bulk of American households are in far better financial shape at the outset of this crisis than they were just prior to the Great Recession. Overall, American households have positive net worth. Household debt service as a percent of disposable income stood at 9.7 percent as of October 2019, compared with 13.2 percent in January 2008. This year began with only 3.5 percent of all mortgaged properties worth less than their outstanding loan balances, according to CoreLogic; at the height of the Great Recession in late 2009, some 26 percent were underwater.
Ordinary people and small businesses will need to stretch whatever modest equity and reserves they may have accumulated to get through this crisis. It is in everyone’s interest — including their own — for government and creditors to help them do it."

And the Federal Reserve knows it.
Big corporations from beer brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA to Boeing Co. are drawing down billions from their credit lines. Fearful of margin calls and flash crashes, lenders are piling on reserves. Adding to the hair-raising market volatility, banks that typically provide short-term dollar loans are stepping back.
To ease the strain in dollar borrowing, the Fed took action Tuesday, restarting a commercial paper funding facility for U.S. corporates. It also allowed banks and broker-dealers that trade directly with the Fed to borrow cash secured against some stocks and higher-rated bonds.
But that doesn’t do much to ease funding tightness overseas. For evidence, look no further than currency swaps, which measure how expensive it is to borrow in dollars. If a Japanese bank wants to offer a dollar loan to a client, the bank, pocketful of yen deposits, would typically lend its yen in exchange for an American bank’s dollars using currency swaps. This practice is common across Asian markets — and the costs are soaring.
Since the global financial crisis, foreign banks’ dollar lending has ballooned to $12 trillion from $10 trillion, the International Monetary Fund estimates. Lenders abroad like this business because dollar assets tend to offer higher returns and companies prefer to borrow in the currency.
Now, this key corner of the funding market is in trouble. The three-month euro-dollar basis swap slumped to as much as negative 122 basis points Tuesday, the widest since December 2011. That’s despite the Fed promising to boost liquidity via its swap line with the European Central Bank just two days earlier. Stocks fell during European trading hours as investors feared a squeeze.
If the euro swap’s explosion was just a blip, how about markets without a direct line to the Fed? Dollar liquidity conditions in Asia have been tightening recently, too. In South Korea, the one-year won basis swap widened to about negative 90 basis points, from negative 55 basis points only two weeks earlier. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, dollar funding is as tight as the 2011 European financial crisis, going by data from cross-currency swaps.
In the asset management world, the dollar is still the king. If it’s hard to get a hold of them, that doesn’t bode well for risk assets.
Just look at the Korean won, which sank to a 10-year low Tuesday, even though Seoul has been doing a lot of the right things, accumulating its foreign currency reserves and reducing its reliance on short-term external debt. Meanwhile, some Korean stocks have become dirt cheap. The country’s banks, for instance, are trading at only 0.2 times book, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show, making them almost as unloved as the industry’s basket case, Deutsche Bank AG.
Then consider Hong Kong. In February, even with China in the throes of the virus outbreak, the dollar bond market stayed afloat, with mainland developers raising a whopping $6.4 billion. But the funding squeeze has changed the calculation entirely: The total value of Chinese dollar bonds yielding above 15% more than doubled from a week ago. That means China Inc.’s borrowers will have to pay a lot more — and, unfortunately, the offshore market is about the only place big enough to place the half-a-billion-dollar issues they rely on.
While the Fed has taken action on American soil, it could expand its swap lines with more central banks. It’s understandable that the Fed doesn’t want to be the world’s lender of last resort, but it’s a little too late for that: The dollar greases the pipes of global finance. Funds can’t flow freely if things are clogged on the other side of the Pacific.
In its latest financial stability report from October, the IMF worried about the role foreign banks serve in dollar funding. Currency swaps tend to be short-term, volatile and costly, it warned. The coronavirus is only drawing out that instability."
"March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-currency-derivatives-show-dollar-funding-stress/2020/03/18/258251ce-68ed-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,How Currency Derivatives Show Dollar Funding Stress,"As stocks plunged and investors fled to U.S. Treasury bonds in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic, the spotlight shifted to corners of the credit market that show signs of stress. Notable is the move in cross-currency basis swaps, which shows investor preference to hold dollars, rather than euros or yen.
1. What are cross-currency basis swaps?
They’re contracts where two sides agree to exchange interest payments in two different currencies. During the life of the contract, floating interest-rate payments are exchanged, typically on a quarterly basis. On March 17, the premium paid to swap funding exposure from euros into the dollar surged to the widest since 2011. That suggests investors are struggling to get their hands on dollars despite injections of cash into financial markets by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks.
2. What do they tell us about borrowing stress?
Dollar funding stress is particularly pronounced for yen- and euro-based investors, based on cross-currency basis swaps. While higher demand to swap funding exposure from the yen into the dollar was evident from the start of February -- coinciding with the rally in Treasuries -- the euro-denominated market was more resilient until mid-March. The moves have also come at a time when financial companies become increasingly cautious about lending to each other and demand higher premiums on interest over risk-free rates, known as the FRA/OIS spread.
3. Why don’t central bank dollar swap lines always work?
Major central banks, including those in the eurozone and Japan, said on March 15 that they would lower dollar borrowing costs and offer longer-term dollar loans to lenders in their respective jurisdictions. These central banks borrow dollars from the Federal Reserve in exchange for an equivalent amount of their local currencies. While the measures can ease pressures for banks, the effect is felt in a broader economy only if these lenders extend more dollar loans to companies and other institutions. Banks also may shun a central bank swap line because of a stigma attached to tapping it.
4. Who uses cross-currency basis swaps?
Banks are the biggest users, while hedge funds and proprietary trading firms rank second. The favored currencies are the dollar, euro and yen. Most contracts involve the dollar. They typically range from 1 to 30 years, reflecting the length of the transactions they fund, such as loans. What makes them unique in the world of swaps is that the parties agree to exchange notional principals, or the face amount used to calculate the payments.
5. Why do investors need them?
Let’s say a European company needs a dollar loan. While the firm may be well-established on the continent, banks in the U.S. may demand a stiffer rate to lend to a relatively little-known entity on the other side of the Atlantic. Enter the cross-currency basis swap. The European firm borrows in euros and swaps the payment into dollars with another entity that needs funds in Europe’s common currency.
6. What happens if the widening in basis swaps continues?
That’s the million-dollar question. If investors continue to seek the safety of Treasuries and stocks keep tumbling, the preference to swap out funding exposure into the dollar may persist. The pressure may be more pronounced in the yen market because it’s historically been a good proxy for institutional funding stress.
7. What is the ‘basis’ in cross-currency basis swaps?
Basis is a measure of how closely the exchange rates (forward and spot) reflect the difference in interest rates. According to a theory known as covered interest parity, a forward exchange rate is priced to take account of the interest received on the currencies over the term of the forward rate, so that an investor will receive at the end the same amount he or she started with; hence the “parity.”
8. Does the theory work?
Not so often. And when it doesn’t that’s where the “basis“ comes in. An example: if the dollar-yen forward exchange rate is 1.59% below the spot rate, and the gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates is 1.23 percentage points, the difference is minus 36 basis points. So, the basis is negative 36. More formally, the basis is the difference between the forward exchange rate and the spot rate minus the difference between the two interest rates.
9. How does a basis swap work?
The basis is used to calculate interest paid during the swap. Say investor A borrows dollars from investor B and simultaneously lends yen, at the spot rate, to investor B. At the end of the swap, the currencies will be returned using the same exchange rate. During the term of the swap, investor A will pay the going interest rate on the dollar and will receive interest on the yen adjusted for the basis.
10. What does a negative or positive basis show?
A negative basis means the investor will receive less interest. It represents the premium the investor must pay over the interest-rate differential. A positive basis means the investor is receiving a discount to the interest-rate differential.
11. What does this mean for companies?
A higher negative basis value means local investors have to bear higher costs to hedge currency risks when buying foreign assets. Companies borrowing locally and converting the proceeds into dollars using basis swaps suffer. A higher negative basis also means dollar holders can take advantage of strong demand for the greenback to enhance returns. It’s a ploy that the Reserve Bank of Australia used when it swapped the bulk of its foreign-currency holdings into yen.
12. How do the two methods come to produce similar results?
Take this example. A Japanese investor bought $1 million at a spot rate of 110.40 on June 2 and agreed to sell three months later with a forward rate of 109.96. The effective borrowing rate works out as 1.59% per annum. Using basis swaps instead to lend 110.40 million yen and borrow $1 million, the borrowing rate comes to 1.5575%. (That includes 1.22250% interest on the dollar loan, based on the London interbank offered rate. The three-month dollar-yen basis swap was quoted at minus 32.25, while the three-month yen Libor was minus 0.01250%. Add them together and the interest is minus 0.3350%. So this investor has to pay, instead of receive, 0.3350% on the yen that was lent, as well as the 1.22250% on the dollar loan: a combined 1.5575%.)"

By the time Baidu Inc. reported two weeks later, shares of the search-engine provider had lost 11.7%, while those of Alibaba were down 6.4% and social media powerhouse Tencent Holdings Ltd. had slipped 6.2%.
Just as investors should have known in mid-February that there was trouble ahead, they’d be well-advised to look at the reality that’s presented to them now and be just as circumspect. China may have gotten past the worst of Covid-19, but the world is just starting to grapple with it and a major economic shock is looming. 
Now, as we digest Tencent’s fourth-quarter numbers and muddy outlook, these stocks have continued to drop. As have group-buying outfit Pinduoduo Inc. and internet companies Sina Corp. and Weibo Corp.Yet despite declines of a third or more in market value, some of China’s internet darlings are trading at levels seen as recently as three months ago. Tencent, for example, is back where it was Dec. 5. This indicates that investors aren’t pricing in a big economic jolt, but merely a minor bump on the highway of fast growth and climbing profits.
In its investor conference call late Wednesday, Tencent didn’t give explicit details on what to expect this quarter. The company did note that the payments business, now one of its fastest-growing units, will post a drop in revenue, offset by a reduction in marketing costs. By comparison, Baidu, Weibo, and Sina all gave specific sales guidance — each predicted declines of 15% to 20% from a year earlier.
It’s clearly going to be a tough first quarter, but executives spent much time on their conference calls talking up their future prospects in the belief that this is a minor blip. Robin Li, Baidu’s chairman and chief executive, defended his optimism by claiming that expenditure will merely be delayed: “If you plan to get married, you are still going to marry. If you’re trying to buy a car, you are still buying a car.”
I can’t help wondering if these business leaders are looking too closely at China’s Covid-19 case count, and correlating a decline in new patients to an immediate rebound in revenue. Certainly, the mood on the ground has brightened and workers are returning to their posts.
However, they may not sufficiently be taking on board that the disease has gone global. The disparate attempts in Europe and the Americas to bring it under control mean that any resolution won’t come quickly. It may be the case that with their revenue coming almost exclusively from domestic consumers, they believe a wider meltdown won’t cause much pain.That may be a little naive. Exports account for an important portion of China’s gross domestic product and occupy a significant part of its labor force. Foxconn Technology Group, for example, is the largest private employer in China and gets more than half its revenue from Apple Inc. If orders at these businesses dry up, Chinese consumers will need to reduce expenditure. 
Last year, I noted that what may save Chinese internet companies is their shift to a post-growth era by trimming costs such as marketing, which some pragmatic executives have done. They’re going to need to adapt again, this time to reflect a world that truly is connected, and where an external shock could quickly become a local problem. 
Chinese tech companies may think they’ve got through the worst of the storm. They’d better brace themselves for the fact that there is nowhere to hide."
"March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/19/this-is-how-trump-escapes/,The Washington Post,This is how Trump escapes,"President Trump’s grievous failure for months to ramp up testing and medical capacity to address the coronavirus has imperiled the country. The best-case scenario may be that “only” hundreds of thousands die. Meanwhile, the economy and daily life have ground to a halt. The stock market has lost all gains since he took office. (What he used to point to as evidence of his economic brilliance is now confirmation of his total incompetence.) Trump’s presidency is a failure by any reasonable standard, and things might get worse before November.
George Conway III urges Trump to resign, although he recognizes that the egomaniac is unlikely to follow his advice. There is, however, another way in which Trump might be able to able to garner a tiny bit of credit and also avoid the further humiliation of a Herbert Hoover-type defeat. (In the 1932 election, the president who presided over the Wall Street crash lost the electoral college to Franklin D. Roosevelt 59-472.) He might even be able to lift the spirits of the country and give the markets a shot of adrenaline and announce he will not run for reelection.
Before you dismiss this out of hand, consider that Trump uses the presidency to enrich himself and his family, but most of all to feed his insatiable ego. Confronted with a debacle he is unable to solve, a second term would surely be misery for him. His properties might lose even more of their value as his name becomes associated with catastrophe. (Imagine staying in the Herbert Hoover International Hotel.)
Without admitting defeat or failure — he’s a 10 out of 10! — he can announce he is going to devote himself full-time to the crisis for the remainder of his term, which will allow no time to campaign. (He cannot even hold rallies, the one thing that tends to satisfy the narcissist, at least temporarily.) He’s being heroic, forfeiting a second term to save the country!
And bluntly, his promise to leave might restore confidence to the markets. Business leaders, investors and consumers alike might welcome an election between Vice President Pence and former vice president Joe Biden. (He could quickly assign his delegates to Pence and forgo further primaries.) At least the winner won’t be a fabulist unable to comprehend the magnitude of the problem.
Trump could then claim credit for any economic stabilization between now and next January, and insist that because of his bold actions, he prevented more death and illness was avoided. He’s a hero, you see.
Now, only a world-class narcissist would take credit when those he insults (e.g., Democrats, the Fed, governors) work furiously to mitigate the harm he has magnified, but no one fits the bill of world-class narcissist better than Donald Trump.
Oh, and there is one more benefit to forgoing a second term: Either president-elect Pence or acting president Pence (should Trump decide to skip out after the election but before the inauguration) could pardon him. Surely he does not want to rely on the victim of his smear, Biden, to pardon him.
As Alice Roosevelt Longworth said of her father Theodore Roosevelt, “[he] always [wanted] to be the corpse at every funeral, the bride at every wedding and the baby at every christening.” Trump needs to be the hero in every crisis, even ones he caused. The way to do that might be to end his presidency at one term (as Hoover’s did), but leave with a cover story that preserves his massive ego."

Lenders will get Community Reinvestment Act credit for lending that’s “responsive to the needs of low- and moderate-income individuals, small businesses and small farms affected by COVID-19,” the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a statement. Expansion of CRA credit has been used before, including for banks that helped Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
Because a national emergency has been declared, banks can also get CRA credit for community-development activity that supports local services, according to the statement. The offer for banks will be effective for six months after the emergency declaration is lifted, unless a decision is made to extend it, the agencies said.
The regulators’ move follows a series of actions meant to free banks to keep lending through the virus-caused economic crisis. This latest effort taps CRA at a time when the two of the agencies are trying to finish a major overhaul of the 1970s rule that would pre-set a list of common activities to be given lending credit."
"March 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/the-virus-has-arts-groups-hanging-by-a-thread-michael-m-kaiser-has-ideas-about-saving-them/2020/03/19/f7985b76-69e8-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html,The Washington Post,The virus has arts groups hanging by a thread. Michael M. Kaiser has ideas about saving them.,"If you didn’t know that the country’s 100,000 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations live on the edge, consider these statistics: the average museum and performing arts group operates with less than two months of working capital on hand and the average orchestra has a cushion of just 15 days.
Which is why the survival of many of these companies — particularly the wide swath of medium-size groups, with budgets of between about $2 million and $10 million — has arts leaders and patrons so worried. Experts in the field, such as Michael M. Kaiser, former president of the Kennedy Center who chairs the DeVos Institute for Arts Management at the University of Maryland, say the outlook for these groups is increasingly ominous.
Covid-19 has shut down the overwhelming majority of arts organizations, which means revenue has stopped cold. With every month of the pandemic that keeps them closed, the prospects of braving the crisis intact diminish, Kaiser says. He has some recommendations for how groups of all sizes might weather this unprecedented threat to their existence, with this alarming caveat:
“If this goes on for six months, then all bets are off. Then I think we’re really starting the arts ecology over.”
The cellphones of Kaiser and DeVos Institute President Brett Egan have been buzzing like crazy with entreaties for advice from executives of the hundreds of groups with which the institute works. While still at the Kennedy Center, which he headed from 2001 to 2014, Kaiser created a version of the institute, now a consultancy for nonprofit arts managers and trustees. Clients have included orchestras and hip-hop festivals, Utah’s Sundance Institute and New York City’s Apollo Theatre, 9/11 memorial and photography museums, Latinx dance troupes and regional theaters.
Surveying the arts landscape, Kaiser, in a phone interview, said there are huge financial challenges across the board, but that he reserves his greatest anxieties for those midsize outfits. The behemoth institutions in many cities, with the wealthiest and most devoted donors, will in all likelihood survive, he said. The smallest companies, the ones accustomed to working with meager resources, may also be well designed for the innovative flexibility required of trying times.
“The hardest are those midsize organizations,” he said. These are companies with a substantial payroll to meet and facilities of their own to maintain, or, as Kaiser put it: “That midsize organization which has an overhead — their productions are not cheap; they just opened something or were about to, on a budget and now with no revenue; they don’t have fancy donors. They’re the ones who have the biggest problem.”
He cited one company in this category in a major city, but asked that it not be identified. “It does really good work, and is having an amazingly good year. And now . . . it’s over. They have a new show, bore all the costs of rehearsal and all the costs of sets and all the costs of marketing — and get zero. And they don’t have the access to David Rubenstein,” he added, referring to the billionaire philanthropist who chairs the Kennedy Center board.
Comparing the challenge to the fiscal calamities that ensued for the arts after 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis, Kaiser said a covid-19 wipeout could go deeper. “And I would argue,” he said, “that the organizations that were the most interesting were the ones that survived the best.”
Being interesting, then, may not be such an entirely separate issue down the road from remaining solvent. To take risks with programming, in other words, becomes even more critical. “It’s not the time to get boring, even in your planning,” Kaiser said. “We have to be planning for exciting, important art, more than ever.”
That so many organizations exist with such a paltry rainy-day cushion does not necessarily indicate inadequate management. Egan, in a separate phone interview, observed that producing art on thin ice is a function of creativity. “Any cultural organization worth its salt pushes itself constantly to the point of exhaustion,” he said. “It’s in the mission-driven nature of the organization: The nature is not to sock away capital.”
Round House Theatre in Bethesda, with an $8 million annual budget, is one of those midsize operations. It announced Thursday the discontinuation of its 2019-20 season: the canceling of three plays including the 2018 Pulitzer Prize winning “Cost of Living” by Martyna Majok, which will now move to the start of the 2021-22 season. The company’s leaders, artistic director Ryan Rilette and managing director Ed Zakreski, said in a Skype interview that they believed they were in a strong position to reemerge in good health.
“We are operating not from a position of weakness,” Zakreski said. “We had no debt, other than the debt for renovation,” which was funded through a successful campaign. They paid the actors in “Cost of Living” two weeks’ severance, and unlike some companies that are furloughing employees, they intend to keep paying their staff, and are offering art and education programs online.
It should be noted, however, that while the company has ambitions of accumulating a reserve fund that would last six months, at the moment expenses can be covered for about 2½ months. (Additional income is expected to carry the company into the fall, according to Zakreski.) “We are not in a position where we have to immediately start laying off staff,” Rilette explained. “That said, we will need some help.”
The metaphorical vise in which arts organizations find themselves, Kaiser said, is that they want to express a need for assistance without looking desperate or as if they might not be around — what he called treading “very carefully between being forthright and whining.”
To that end, the institute has suggestions for mitigating the economic challenges. One that Egan outlined was a request of foundations that usually mandate money be committed to specific artistic projects. “Those institutions can waive restrictions on current grants,” he said, “so that you can use the funds to keep your people employed.” Egan also recommends that richer organizations revise rules that prevent the drawdown of their endowments to pay current costs: “Is this the time,” Egan asked, “to relax how much capital we need to keep?”
Some foundations already are looking at emergency aid, Egan said. But a more crucial ingredient of who survives may be the degree to which arts groups are viewed as necessities to their customers.
“I talk a lot about how organizations need to build their families, and make people in the community feel a part of their organizations,” Kaiser said. “Those organizations that do it well will do better coming out of coronavirus than those that don’t.”"
"March 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/car-manufacturers-ventilators/2020/03/19/2d1c9c22-6920-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,U.K. asks Rolls-Royce and Jaguar to make ventilators in wartime-like effort,"LONDON — Faced with the prospect that waves of coronavirus patients struggling to breathe will soon overwhelm its hospitals, the British government issued a cry for help from manufacturers — the builders of automobiles, jet engines, dialysis machines, excavation equipment — to switch their assembly lines over to make mechanical ventilators.
It is a desperate, almost absurd appeal, but the government said it had received hundreds of replies over four days from businesses offering to try.
The call for a “national effort,” issued this week by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, is unprecedented in peacetime and recalls the life-or-death scramble of the late 1930s, when Morris Motors turned its factories from assembling boxy sedans to building Spitfire fighters.
Now, the tool-and-die set is being asked not to repel a blitz of Luftwaffe bombers but to mass-produce stripped-down “simple, functional” mechanical ventilators to push life-sustaining saturated oxygen into the lungs of critically ill patients in intensive-care units.
Britain has a single domestic ventilator manufacturer, Breas, in Stratford-upon-Avon, which has moved to a seven-day workweek to increase production but has a staff of only 150 worldwide, according to the BBC.
Another British-based company, Diamedica, provides simpler ventilators to developing countries. Diamedica Managing Director Robert Neighbour said his firm was ready to help and will have prototypes ready in a few days. “We’ve had very little time to eat, sleep or anything else. We’ve had to ramp up production considerably,” he said.
In terms of speed, he said, “If I have all the parts, one person can put 10 together in a day, but when you’re starting to talk about a shortfall in the U.K. between 20,000 and 30,000 ventilators, that can take a while.”
And so the government has reached out to firms including Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Jaguar Land Rover and Vauxhall.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had spoken with manufacturers personally “to seek to bring new supply into the country for mechanical ventilation, and we have set an open-ended goal for what that would be.”
The request reveals a note of panic, as new forecasts predict the number of patients suffering from the coronavirus may soon begin to soar into the tens of thousands here — and that the National Health Service is frighteningly underprepared.
The government this month estimated it had 5,000 ventilators on hand. Stevens provided lawmakers a more precise tally. NHS hospitals in England, which serve a population of 56 million, have only 8,165 mechanical ventilators on hand, including 750 designed to treat children that would have to be repurposed for populations at greater risk, plus another 691 in private practice, and 35 held by the military.
The paucity of ventilators in Britain is made worse by a worldwide shopping spree by governments seeking breathing machines, which can cost between $25,000 to $50,000, depending on the model. Everyone is facing back orders.
British technologists say, in theory, it would be possible for a Rolls-Royce or Mini Cooper factory, with its sophisticated tooling and skilled workers, to turn itself into a ventilator manufacturer.
But can the British boffins DIY the country out of this crisis?
The government is not looking for the most sophisticated ventilator, but an economy model, made with available components. It doesn’t want the Bentley Betayga of ventilators; it wants a Chevy Spark.
The challenges are daunting. 
“There’s the skill and capability in the U.K. to do it. But how quickly?” said Robert Harrison, professor of automation at the University of Warwick.
“These are life-critical, very sophisticated instruments, composed of electronics, sensors, valves, pumps,” he said, adding that the machines are also highly regulated medical devices, not vacuum cleaners.
“The call to produce them is unprecedented and goes back to efforts made in wartime,” Harrison said. “There’s been nothing like this in our lifetimes.”
Tony Hague, chief executive of PP Control and Automation, a 230-person manufacturer with experience making medical devices, listed some of the hurdles.
To make a modern version of a ventilator requires sophisticated electronics. “And all the intelligent components are made in Asia, mostly China, which has had its own problems lately,” Hague said. And new entrants to the modern ventilator business might need licenses from overseas companies that own the designs and other proprietary intellectual property, he said.
As a kind of hack, Hague and others are looking at schematic diagrams of ventilators made 50 years ago. He said that if hospitals could make do with much more basic devices, the kind of electrical, mechanical, pneumatic machines produced in the 1940s, British manufacturers might be able to do that rapidly, with parts off the shelf.
He warned, “they’d look nothing like the units in use today.”
Hague said under normal circumstances, it would be “almost ridiculous” to imagine Jaguar or Rolls-Royce or his own company turning to ventilators overnight, “but this isn’t normal times. You must think differently.”
In the United States, GM and Ford are in talks with the government about possibly supporting the production of ventilators and other medical equipment. Elon Musk, the founder of the Tesla automotive company, tweeted Thursday, “We will make ventilators if there is a shortage.” Many replied that the need was now.
In Britain, Airbus and Rolls-Royce were among those that said they were looking to see what they could practically do to help. Jeremy Townsend, a spokesman for automaker Vauxhall, said: “We are keen to assist at Vauxhall Motor’s Ellesmere Port plant. Once we have more details on the requirements, we will be able to analyze what we can do.”
The government is providing manufacturers with two pages of specifications for a “Rapidly Manufactured Ventilation System,” its stripped-down device.
Requirements include: “Be reliable. It must work continuously without failure (100% duty cycle) for blocks of 14 days — 24 hours a day. If necessary, the machine may be replaced after each block of 14 days x 24 hours a day use.”
But there are doubters.
“The idea that an engineering company can quickly manufacture medical devices, and comply with the rules, is unrealistic, because of the heavy burden of standards and regulations that need to be complied with,” Craig Thompson, head of products at medical equipment maker Penlon, told the BBC.
Ben Fletcher, director of external affairs at Make UK, an engineering trade body, said getting the design right was critical. “It’s got to be a machine that operates in a way doctors are comfortable using,” he said. “There are problems and risks involved with using older technology. It’s not that it can’t do the job, but it’s not the technology people will be comfortable using.”
Fletcher said the government hadn’t given industry a request for a specific quantity of ventilators. “The government has simply said to us, we will buy every machine that can be made.”"

Kirsten Gillibrand, a former 2020 foe, backs Joe Biden for president","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) threw her support behind former vice president Joe Biden on Thursday, joining a dozen other former competitors to back his bid to become the Democratic nominee for president.
“He’s the absolute best candidate to defeat President Trump, and I think he is the person who has gained the trust and the respect of the American people in a way that no one else has,” Gillibrand said in an interview with The Washington Post. “The truth is he’s run the strongest campaign.”
Gillibrand’s nod comes as much of the party is coalescing behind Biden, who has racked up a more than 200 delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The third well-known competitor in the race, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), ended her campaign Thursday and endorsed Biden.
The health and financial crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic contributed to her view that Biden is the right candidate, Gillibrand said.
“His ability to empathize and absorb the fears of the country right now is essential,” Gillibrand said. “I think we need a healer. . . . I do truly believe he is the man for this moment that we’re in here.”
Gillibrand and Biden clashed on a debate stage in July when she confronted him about an op-ed he had written in August 1981 titled “Congress is Subsidizing Deterioration of Family.” The piece laid out why he had voted against expanding a child-care tax credit.
“I think it’s a sad commentary on our society when the Senate of the United States says, as a matter of social policy, that we should make it easier for people who have neither the financial necessity nor personal need to forsake their responsibility to care for their own children,” Biden wrote.
The measure passed the chamber on a 94-1 vote, with Biden explaining in the op-ed that he was the sole holdout because he didn’t believe that upper-income families should be eligible for the tax credit.
Onstage, Gillibrand asked him to clarify whether he believed that putting children in child care was inherently bad for families and should be done only out of financial necessity.
“So under Vice President Biden’s analysis, am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family?” Gillibrand, who has two children, asked during the debate. “Because I had access to quality affordable day care? I just want to know what he meant when he said that.”
“I never believed it,” Biden retorted. He also pointed out that both of his wives had careers and that after his first wife and daughter died he raised his two sons.
Gillibrand, who dropped out of the race a month after their dispute, said Thursday that she believes Biden is a champion for women and added that he backed her legislation that would provide paid family and medical leave.
“He has shown throughout his campaign that he is willing to lead on these issues on families, on work, on equal pay for equal work, affordable day care, universal pre-K and a national paid leave plan.”
Biden’s announcement during a Sunday debate that he will pick a female running mate was “smart,” Gillibrand said. Asked whether she would serve as his No. 2, she said: “I certainly would consider supporting [him] in any way that he wants me to. But I also know that I can be very effective for him in the U.S. Senate.”"
"March 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-april-15-isnt-so-taxing-for-americans-this-year/2020/03/20/f788d878-6ac3-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,What to Know About the 2020 U.S. Tax Season,"April 15 has been the annual deadline for paying taxes in the U.S. since 1955. Not this year. Add America’s Tax Day to the list of events that have been postponed as governments, businesses and people reorder day-to-day life to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. American taxpayers will be allowed to keep any money they owe the U.S. government for a few more months.
1. When do Americans have to pay their taxes?
The Treasury Department is giving individuals and corporations an additional three months -- until July 15 -- to file their returns and pay their tax bills. The government is hoping that this will help companies and people who could be facing a short-term cash flow shortage get through the coming weeks until it’s safe to resume normal economic activity. There also was concern that it could be difficult or unsafe for people to met with their tax preparer before April 15 while most schools and many businesses are shut down to prevent the spread of the virus.
2. Does this apply to state tax returns as well?
Not uniformly. Several states, including Maryland, California, Connecticut and Oregon have delayed some deadlines, giving taxpayers more time to submit the paperwork and come up with the cash. Other states are still formulating their plans and deadlines. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is keeping a running list of state and city tax deadline extensions.
3. Can I get an extension?
In a normal year, the Internal Revenue Service will atomatically grant a six-month filing extension, no questions asked, giving Americans until October 15 to file their returns. But the extension does not apply to the money owed, so interest and penalties accrue once the payment deadline -- April 15 normally -- passes. Whether extensions will be so leniently granted this year, and how long they’d be for, are still to be determined. Last year, a record 15 million taxpayers requested the six-month filing extension. Accountants had expected that even more would request one this year.
4. What will this mean for the U.S. economy?
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin estimates that the payment delay will inject about $300 billion in liquidity into the economy as individuals (wealthy ones, generally speaking) and companies keep their money longer. Most middle- and lower-income people don’t owe a tax bill -- they get a refund instead. They can, and usually do, file early in the tax season to get their hands on their refund checks as quickly as possible.
5. Will tax refunds be delayed?
Though the IRS is cutting staff in half at some of its processing centers, that shouldn’t have a significant impact on refund timing, according to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. The agency recommends filing as soon as possible, submitting your return electronically and opting to get the refund via direct deposit, rather than by check, to get your refund as quickly as possible. The IRS says the average time to get a refund is three weeks."
"March 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2020/03/20/sen-richard-burr-r-n-c-says-he-has-asked-senate-ethics-committee-for-review-of-his-stock-sales/,The Washington Post,Sen. Burr asks Senate Ethics Committee for review of his stock sales amid uproar over possible influence of coronavirus briefings,"Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) sought an ethics review Friday of his recent sale of more than $1.7 million in stocks as he and other lawmakers faced a bipartisan uproar over whether they had used information gleaned from private congressional briefings to guide transactions before the market plummeted because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, who had publicly expressed confidence in the country’s preparedness for the pandemic, sold a significant portion of his stocks last month, according to public disclosures. Burr said he relied solely on public news reports for the sales but asked the Senate Ethics Committee for a review.
“Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,” Burr said in a statement.
The sales included stocks in some of the industries that were later hardest hit by the pandemic, including those in hotels, restaurants, shipping, drug manufacturing and health care, records show. In his statement, Burr said he had relied specifically on “CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus.”
Until about a week ago, President Trump and GOP leaders had projected optimism about the country’s ability to manage the global outbreak of the coronavirus.
Burr’s actions prompted widespread criticism, including from some conservative commentators, as well as calls for his resignation from Democrats in his home state, among others. Even some of his GOP colleagues said scrutiny of his stock sales was appropriate.
Sen. Thom Tillis, Burr’s Republican colleague from the Tar Heel State, said in a tweet Friday that “given the circumstances, Senator Burr owes North Carolinians an explanation” and that an Ethics Committee review could provide a “professional and bipartisan inquiry into this matter.”
As head of the powerful Intelligence Committee, Burr was receiving frequent briefings and reports on the threat of the virus. He also sits on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which received briefings on the pandemic.
In mid-February, Burr sold 33 stocks held by him and his spouse, estimated at between $628,033 and $1.7  million, Senate financial disclosures show. It was the largest number of stocks he had sold in one day since at least 2016, records show.
Burr, who spent a decade in the House before his election to the Senate in 2004, has said that his current term will be his last and that he will not seek reelection when his seat is up in 2022.
The recent stock sales of several other lawmakers have also drawn scrutiny in light of questions about whether they acted on information that was not broadly available at the time.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a federal watchdog group, announced Friday that it was filing complaints with the Senate Ethics Committee against Burr and Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), another lawmaker whose recent stock sales have prompted media scrutiny.
In the weeks after a closed Senate briefing, Loeffler sold holdings valued at between $1.28 million and $3.1 million in companies like ExxonMobil and Auto Zone, which have seen their stock prices fall significantly, while she purchased shares in a company that sells teleworking software. Loeffler also sits on the Senate Health panel.
Common Cause, another advocacy group, announced that it was filing complaints with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission against Burr and Loeffler, as well as against Sens. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).
During an appearance Friday on CNBC, Loeffler said that sales by her and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, were made “at the decision of our investment managers” and that she didn’t learn of them until well after the fact.
“Certainly I had no involvement,” Loeffler said, adding that she would welcome any scrutiny that is appropriate and that she has always adhered “to the letter and the spirit of the law.”
Loeffler pointed to a nonpublic disclosure made to the Senate Ethics Committee, stating that her financial transactions are “notified to filer on or after” the date they are made. But the disclosure, a copy of which her staff provided to The Washington Post, does not clarify whether she had any role in directing the transactions.
Inhofe said he did not even attend a closed Senate briefing on the coronavirus that could have helped inform stock decisions. He said the sale of stocks worth up to $400,000 on Jan. 27 was carried out by a financial manager and part of a long-term plan to cash out holdings.
Feinstein said that she was not at the briefing, either, and that her husband oversees the portfolio.
Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and his wife made dozens of stock sales in January and February, selling up to $165,000 in shares of casino company Caesars Entertainment, whose value has been badly hit, like those of many other leisure businesses. He and his wife also made dozens of purchases, including investing up to $260,000 in Pfizer, the pharmaceutical corporation, in late February.
Perdue told reporters that he would be “very happy for somebody to take a look at” his transactions.
Federal officials are barred by law from using the nonpublic information they learn in their positions for their private financial gain.
Experts said that given the global fears at the time of these stock sales and purchases, it is not unusual that people would make significant decisions about selling or buying stocks.
But the question at hand is whether specific information provided to these senators during private briefings informed their judgments of which industries would fare better or worse as a result of the disease’s spread to the United States, said Matthew Nielsen, a white-collar defense partner and expert at laws governing insider trading, who works at the law firm Bracewell LLP.
For example, Burr sold stocks in the hospitality industry, and Loeffler purchased stocks in Citrix, which provides remote-working technology.
“This comes down to . . . whether there was specific, classified information that would have been something unavailable to the public, that led someone to conclude that there was going to be significantly more impact” on that industry, Nielsen said.
Insider-trading prohibitions apply to all members of Congress, congressional staffers and other federal officials, under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (Stock) Act of 2012. Burr was among three senators who voted against the legislation at the time.
Pandemic preparation has been a focus for Burr for well over a decade. In 2006, he and Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) co-authored the first Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which has been periodically reauthorized, most recently in June 2019, after it lapsed in late 2018.
Burr trumpeted many of the law’s provisions in a Feb. 7 Fox News op-ed that he wrote with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, striking a tone of calm as he stressed that Congress had already given the administration the tools it needed to combat the virus.
But that editorial has been criticized for not sounding an urgent alarm about the crisis, given the briefings Burr was receiving.
Burr has argued that he based his decision on publicly available information. People familiar with his expertise have said that if anyone in the Senate would have recognized the potential of the pandemic to spin out of control, it would have been him — though some also cautioned that the information available to congressional officials and the public was changing on a day-to-day basis throughout the month.
Burr’s fascination with pandemic readiness sits at the nexus of two panels on which he has long served: the Health and Intelligence committees. He has frequently spoken out during global public health crises, reminding administrations that they have congressionally authorized tools at their disposal to combat pandemics, most recently in 2016, in response to an outbreak of Ebola.
The initial reports and updates that the Intelligence Committee received were mostly focused on how the coronavirus outbreak was playing out in countries like China and Iran, and whether those governments were reporting their statistics accurately — not on predicting the potential of the coronavirus threat to metastasize in the United States.
It is not exactly clear how frequently the members of the Health committee, on which Burr and Loeffler both sit, were receiving in-person briefings.
But the panel did receive several updates on the situation between Jan. 24, when Loeffler tweeted about a coronavirus briefing she had attended, and March 3, when the panel interviewed National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Deputy Director Anne Schuchat in an open hearing about the threat.
In the hearing, Burr warned against “micromanaging” the administration or passing legislation that would simply double on what was already authorized in the pandemic response law he authored. But he did not sound happy with the administration’s execution of the coronavirus response.
That hearing was five days after Burr delivered dire comments about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak to a North Carolina State Society gathering on Capitol Hill that were first highlighted by NPR, and about three weeks after the stock trades in question."

Congress should look out for real estate brokers, many of whom are independent contractors, as it prepares to assist other affected industries and small businesses, Reffkin wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.
“Shelter in place” policies and social distancing prevent agents from showing properties, curbing their ability to make a living, Reffkin said. Government help could “keep these small businesses afloat.” Closely held Compass was last valued at $6.4 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund.

"March 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/03/20/spring-temperature-outlook/,The Washington Post,"Abnormally warm spring expected over entire U.S., according to NOAA and others","After an unusually mild winter across the nation, forecasters are now calling for a substantially warmer-than-normal spring.
The National Weather Service, AccuWeather and the Weather Company, in rare lockstep agreement, are all predicting above-average temperatures into June.
“There is almost no part of the country that we are predicting to be below normal in any of the three months, which is unusual,” said AccuWeather chief executive Joel Myers in AccuWeather’s outlook published Thursday. “This may be a first.""
The National Weather Service’s outlook, released Thursday, conveyed the same message: “No part of the country is favored to experience below-average temperatures this spring.”
The Weather Company’s outlook for April through June, issued March 12, is headlined: “Widespread Warmth Across U.S.”
Hues of orange, signaling various degrees of anomalous warmth, cover the maps released by these three organizations. While they agree most of the nation, if not its entirety, will be warmer than average, they do differ in region-to-region predictions.
The Weather Service and AccuWeather both forecast the strongest warm signal in the eastern United States and along the West Coast, with a weaker signal in the middle of the nation.
The Weather Company’s outlook, however, calls for the greatest chance of above-normal temperatures from the West Coast through the Midwest.
The forecast for a warm spring, the Weather Company’s outlook said, is in part due to the abnormally strong polar vortex, which has bottled up frigid air over the Arctic rather than allowing it to spill south. The vortex typically breaks down in early spring.
The Weather Company’s chief meteorologist, Todd Crawford, also noted in the outlook that cooling ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific often support warmer-than-normal conditions heading into summer over the Lower 48 states.
Matt Rogers, a long-range forecaster for the Commodity Weather Group and a Capital Weather Gang contributor, said he agreed with the general idea of a warm spring across the nation but cautioned the West may see average to cooler than average conditions due to the continuation of a stormy pattern that has recently brought beneficial rain and snow to California.
Rogers also said there are signs the polar vortex is weakening, which could allow for some cooler weather in the central and eastern United States in the coming weeks.
“I agree with them [the other outlooks] in spirit overall, but I do need to think we need to watch for some cooler volatility during the front half of April,” Rogers said.
The forecast for warmer-than-average weather in the coming months follows a winter that ranked as the sixth-warmest on record for the Lower 48 and a premature start to spring in many areas. According to the USA National Phenology Network, which tracks the blooming of plants, leaves emerged on trees three to four weeks early in parts of the southern and eastern United States.
While factors such as the strength of the polar vortex and ocean and atmosphere cycles, such as El Niño, play a large role in a given season’s weather, the long-term increase in average temperatures due to human-caused climate change are increasing the likelihood of abnormal warmth.
There is a relatively remote possibility that the warmer than average spring into the early summer could help slow the spread of coronavirus, if some preliminary analyses that have found or projected drops in virus transmission at higher temperatures, prove correct. However, these analyses have not been peer-reviewed, and the virus has been spreading in parts of the United States that have warm weather, including Florida, as well as warm international areas, including the Philippines. In recent days, the virus has also made inroads in South Africa and India, two countries with mild average temperatures."

Although there is much uncertainty over how long the pandemic will last, area governments are bracing for a wrenching change that will abruptly end an era of flush budgets. Many liken the potential impact to that of the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 recession combined.
“This has the potential to be worse than the Great Recession, because you’re shutting down entire industries,” such as hotels and restaurants, said Jeffrey S. DeWitt, the District’s chief financial officer.
“It’s not unthinkable that we would hit 15 percent to 20 percent unemployment numbers in the District. I don’t think we’ve ever seen those kinds of numbers in the District before,” he said. “How long that lasts depends on how long the event lasts.”
Area governments’ capacity to absorb the blow will depend greatly on how much help they get from the federal government. In hard times in the past, federal Washington has provided critical extra funds for rising demands, such as for health care and food stamps for the poor.
The good news for the region is that its governments start with abundant cash reserves, thanks to years of economic growth in the nationwide expansion that economists say the virus has slammed to a halt.
Virginia has nearly $2 billion in reserves, Maryland has $1.2 billion in its “rainy-day fund,” and the District begins with the equivalent of 77 days worth of spending.
But those buffers are going to shrink as tax revenue drops and demands rise.
“That’s the greatest difficulty in government, that your revenue goes down and your expenditures go up during a recession,” said Andrew Schaufele, director of the Maryland comptroller’s Bureau of Revenue Estimates. “We are certainly preparing for that.”
Early signs point to the sharpest drop in economic activity in memory. Unemployment claims in Maryland rose fivefold in a week; in Virginia, claims spiked even more. Local 25 of the hotel workers union, Unite Here, reported that more than three-quarters of its 7,200 members were out of work.
“It’s not a slowdown. It’s a shutdown, basically,” Virginia Finance Secretary Aubrey Layne said.
Alexandria City Manager Mark B. Jinks said Wednesday at an emergency City Council meeting, “Sometimes it feels like we’re on a surfboard with a tsunami at our backs.”
State and local governments have begun looking at ways to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from their spending.
The Maryland Senate has already curtailed a costly overhaul of the state’s K-12 schools over economic concerns springing from the pandemic. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) is expected to seek amendments or make adjustments in the budget recently passed by the General Assembly. DeWitt warned the D.C. Council on Wednesday that the District would have to reduce spending by $500 million to account for lost revenue if the shutdown of the tourism and hospitality industries lasts until June.
In the Washington region, the jurisdictions hit hardest at the start are likely to be the District and the two state governments. That’s because they rely more than county governments on sales tax and income tax for revenue.
Sales-tax receipts are expected to drop quickly as economic activity dries up. Income-tax revenue will follow, although much of the impact will be delayed until next year, when individuals will report lower capital gains as a result of the recent stock market collapse.
County government budgets rely more on property taxes, where the impact will be felt only if a general economic downturn reduces home prices and thus assessments.
“The long-term fundamentals for home and real estate values won’t change much,” said Jeannette Chapman, director of George Mason University’s Stephen S. Fuller Institute for Research on the Washington Region’s Economic Future. “We’re not in ‘Mad Max’ land yet.”
Still, Chapman and other economists are expecting an economic downturn. Her initial forecast, issued Wednesday, is for an economic contraction from April to December in the nation and the Washington region.
“Unless there’s a vaccine developed like, next week, this will cause a recession nationally, and it will flatten out our economy,” Chapman said. “Right now, my assumption is that there will be some return to normal life in June. Obviously, if it’s longer than that, it will have a larger impact.”
Chapman predicts the Washington area will fare slightly better than the nation as a whole because its economy is based comparatively little on manufacturing and thus is less vulnerable to international supply-chain interruptions.
Also, a relatively high share of workers in the region are able to work remotely.
Other observers think the federal government’s presence in the region means it will be less affected.
“In times of uncertainty, [the federal government] is a pretty good buffer,” Layne said. “They’re not going to stop paying federal employees. They’re not going to stop shipbuilding [in Hampton Roads].”
He added that decisions by the White House and Congress on the size and shape of relief packages would determine how much pain the state government in Richmond will experience.
“It all comes back to how much money the federal government gives us, as to how severe the revenue reductions are going to be in Virginia,” Layne said.
Officials and analysts said state and local governments should move quickly to provide small businesses with grants, loans and relaxed regulations to prevent layoffs.
“The most important thing that government can do right now is put money in the hands of business owners,” said Yesim Sayin Taylor, executive director of the D.C. Policy Center. “Not a lot of them have a lot of cash on hand or immediate access to credit.”
Another important form of assistance could be aid to renters, but available funds could disappear quickly.
“We have a rental assistance program with more than $500 million in reserves that could help a lot with the community,” said Richard S. Madaleno Jr., director of Montgomery County’s Office of Management and Budget. “In some sort of crazy, complete meltdown, that could be gone in a month.”"
"March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mail-voting-could-secure-the-november-election-but-can-election-officials-make-it-happen-in-time/2020/03/20/9fedc2ea-69f1-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html,The Washington Post,Mail voting could secure the November election. But can election officials make it happen in time?,"The rapidly escalating coronavirus pandemic has forced election officials to consider a sobering reality: The crisis could run headlong into November’s presidential election, and revamping America’s voting systems before then could be difficult and in some cases impossible.
Even as they postpone upcoming primaries, state and local officials are racing to find longer-term solutions to ensure that the public can safely vote on Nov. 3. While there is growing consensus that voting by mail is the safest way to cast ballots during a pandemic, implementing that system across the country is a huge undertaking that may not be possible, particularly in states where it is limited by law.
In the past week, elections officials have been swapping advice on what it would take: enormous orders of printed ballots and envelopes, high-speed scanners capable of counting the returns and in some cases constitutional amendments to lift restrictions on who may vote by mail — and hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for it all.
“The main thing we’ve discussed is how difficult it would be to go to vote-by-mail in a state where so few people do it,” said Patrick Gannon, spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, noting that only about 4 percent of voters in his state cast ballots by mail in the 2016 presidential contest. “It’s not something that you can turn around overnight.”
That has left voting advocates and political scientists sounding the alarm that states need immediate help from the federal government — or the prospect of a fair election in November is at risk.
This week’s chaotic primaries previewed what could come: Ohio canceled voting hours before voting was set to begin, the Phoenix area shuttered a third of its voting places, hundreds of scared poll workers called in sick in Florida and voters showed up to closed polls in Illinois.
On Friday, Indiana became the seventh state to push back its presidential primary because of the pandemic.
Neither the states nor the president have the power to delay November’s general election, a date set by Congress. But if the pandemic worsens and governors order residents to stay home, that could be tantamount to canceling the election if no other voting options are available.
“We have time to prepare, now, to ensure that these elections can take place, fairly, under any circumstances, and even if public health concerns prevent people from going to the polling booths to vote,” wrote more than 300 academics in an open letter to Congress. “In the entire history of the United States, there has never been a missed election.”
The group is urging Congress to establish national standards for preparing and modifying polling places, expanding early and mail-in voting, expanding online voter registration and educating voters.
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) introduced a new version of a bill this week that would require mail-in balloting and early in-person voting to be offered in every state, and would provide hundreds of millions in assistance for states to implement the changes.
“This country has a great tradition of being able to move really quick when our values are on the line, and I don’t know what’s more valuable than the right to vote,” Wyden, whose state pioneered mail voting in 1998, said in an interview this week.
So far, however, Republicans have not indicated support for the bill.
Only five states in the nation — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington — were set to conduct elections this year in which the vast majority of voters cast their ballots by mail. All of them have taken years to implement their programs, acquire the resources to distribute and count mail ballots on a large scale, and educate the public on how it works.
About two-thirds of states allow voters to cast their ballots by mail for any reason. But in most, only a small portion of the population chooses to do so.
Dramatically scaling up will be difficult, officials said.
Judd Choate, the elections director in Colorado, said he has received calls from counterparts in 11 states this week seeking advice on how to broaden their vote-by-mail programs.
“Everybody comes at it with the same question: ‘How can I get to a full vote-by-mail program by November?’ ” Choate said. “They are trying to pivot very quickly, to find out if it is even possible.”
The answer, Choate said, is probably no. “You’ve got to train thousands of people. You’ve got to completely change how people are doing this. And in some states it’s going to require a statutory change.”
Benjamin Hovland, chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, said he anticipates that every jurisdiction in the nation will experience an uptick in mail-in voting this year as a result of the pandemic.
Hovland said he was scheduled to conduct a Zoom video conference call Friday with election officials in Washington, Orange County, Calif., and Weaver County, Utah — where all registered voters will receive ballots in the mail. He plans to record the call and make it available to other jurisdictions.
One major hurdle will be dealing with a variety of laws on the books that govern absentee ballots. Roughly a third of the states require a reason for voters to qualify for mail-in balloting — such as an illness or travel obligations.
Some states go even further. In the wake of a ballot-tampering scandal in 2018, North Carolina passed legislation requiring two witnesses to sign a ballot — and prohibiting third parties from delivering it. Lawmakers are reconsidering those rules given that many voters may be homebound or in quarantine as a result of the virus.
Florida requires ballot signatures to match a signature on file but doesn’t require giving voters an opportunity to fix a ballot if it is rejected.
In some states, officials said they worry about the threat of coercion if voters are filling out their ballots at home. Colorado solved that problem by allowing any voter to vote in person, an act that voids a mailed ballot.
Delaware’s elections commissioner, Anthony Albence, said his office would need additional resources to send out and then receive so many mailed ballots. But an even more significant barrier, he said, are constitutional and statutory limits on absentee and mail-in voting.
Jay Ashcroft, Missouri’s secretary of state, said legislative action, or a waiving of requirements by the governor or state Supreme Court, would be necessary to remove the need for an excuse.
“My ability to fix this alone is virtually zero,” he said.
Meanwhile, civil rights groups are concerned about another potential problem: that switching to an all-mail system could be so jarring to unaccustomed voters that some could wind up not participating.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas on Thursday advised the state to continue with in-person voting while expanding mail-in options, fearful that an all-mail election could “disenfranchise vulnerable and especially low-income communities,” said Thomas Buser-Clancy, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas.
Morgan Jackson, a Democratic political consultant in North Carolina, said transient students “don’t do a lot by mail” — and minority communities tend to vote disproportionately in person on Election Day.
“You’re talking about people who have had the vote denied to them for years, going back to the Jim Crow era,” Jackson said. “Now telling them they can’t vote in person and have to mail something in — that’s a real step.”
Some states, including Virginia, plan to expand voting by mail without eliminating in-person voting. They are looking at other ways to thin crowds and otherwise protect voters and poll workers on Election Day: recruiting younger people, such as students and teachers, to replace the generally older population that staffs precincts across the country; lengthening the period of in-person early voting; and stocking up on sanitizing supplies to avoid the shortages that plagued primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois this week.
Local officials are already getting creative. In Bristol, Va., a small city in the far southwestern corner of the state, election officials began offering in-person absentee voting Friday for the city’s May 5 municipal elections. Virginia requires a reason to allow in-person or mail-in absentee voting until July 1, when a new law goes into effect lifting that restriction. But Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has ordered all election officials to allow voters to use the pandemic as a reason.
Penny Limburg, Bristol’s general registrar, said they have used an old drive-through window in their building, which once housed a utility company, only sporadically in past elections when voters were unable to exit their cars, such as cancer patients with compromised immune systems. This year the window will be available to all voters, she said.
“I’m pleased we’ve been able to adjust and think it out,” she said, though she said the window, microphone and drawer are “old and glitchy.”
North Carolina will also look at eliminating the requirement that poll workers may only work in precincts in the county where they live. Expanding curbside voting, which is widely offered to meet the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act, is also being explored, but several election officials said it is slow and expensive because of how much manpower is needed.
In some states, officials are brainstorming ways to expand mail-in voting without mandating it for everyone. Several are looking at postage-paid envelopes as well as switching their style of envelope to feature a peel-off adhesive that eliminates the need for licking. And some that require voters to request a mail-in ballot in person or by mail are trying to allow such requests to be made online.
Some states are already claiming emergency authority to expand mail-in voting. West Virginia’s secretary of state, Mac Warner, said Wednesday that his office would “ramp up” absentee options for the state’s May 12 primary, following an advisory opinion from the state’s attorney general that alternative forms of balloting could be expanded during a state of emergency.
New York is also weighing a range of options, as elections officials there took note of Wyden’s bill. In an executive order over the weekend, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) made the “potential for contraction of the COVID-19 virus” count as a “temporary illness” authorizing absentee-ballot requests for elections on or before April 1.
Amber McReynolds, chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute, said her organization had prepared volumes of guidance for states to build out vote-by-mail programs, stressing that states would not have to reinvent the wheel.
When she helped develop Colorado’s mail-ballot scheme as Denver’s director of elections in 2013, she borrowed ideas from Oregon and Washington about signature verification, she said.
“Voting should not be hard,” said Choate, the elections director in Colorado. “It should be easy, and we have the power to make it easy. If the one good outcome of this terrible event in our lives is that we can make voting easier for people around the country, then at least we’ve done one good thing.”"
"March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/proposal-to-send-checks-to-americans-reignites-calls-for-universal-income/2020/03/20/887822e2-6ab7-11ea-8012-fdc44a41cb4f_story.html,The Washington Post,Proposal to send checks to Americans reignites calls for universal income,"Michael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, Calif., thought he had an immediate solution to stave off a plunging economy. Last week, he reached out to Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and took calls from Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). He got in contact with former vice president Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, and told them to advocate for the very thing he felt was working small miracles in his city.
“Send people cash,” Tubbs said he told them.
Stockton has been in the midst of the country’s largest program assessing the benefits of universal basic income. Through a grant, 125 families are receiving checks of $500 each month. Now that lawmakers are strongly considering sending checks to Americans suffering during the pandemic of the novel coronavirus, advocates such as Tubbs are hoping for a watershed moment to bring their movement mainstream.
“The time has come,” Tubbs said. “This pandemic will have reverberating effects. We have to figure out how to make [cash payments] just regular, so we don’t have to panic, so we don’t have to do these emergency cash transfers.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has put together a bill that would provide $1,200 per adult to many American families, as well as $600 per child. Details are still being hammered out, but an effort to quickly put cash in Americans’ hands has bipartisan support in hopes of salvaging the economy amid emergency measures to stem the spread of the virus.
Tubbs and other universal basic income advocates, including former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, say the effects of the virus exposed a fundamentally delicate economy. They say the sudden shuttering of businesses and the soaring number of unemployment claims have made plain the fragile budgets of American workers, 40 percent of whom could not afford a $400 emergency expense, according to a 2019 study from the Federal Reserve.
In Washington, the idea of sending immediate cash to working Americans has drawn an unusual amount of bipartisan support — it’s not often leftists such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) finds themselves on the same side of an argument as conservatives such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).
Still, conservative lawmakers are quick to draw a distinction between the stimulus payments — a rare emergency action — and what they see as an attempt by liberals to use the crisis to advance a preexisting policy agenda for ongoing cash payments.
In an email, Cotton noted that the idea of cutting emergency checks to Americans is not new. During the George W. Bush administration, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the financial crisis, direct cash payments were used to jump-start the economy while “avoiding both red-tape and the empowerment of Washington bureaucrats.”
“A large percentage of Arkansas’ workforce isn’t salaried, can’t telework, and doesn’t have large amounts of savings,” Cotton said. “For those workers, in order to be able to pay their bills and keep their families fed, they need direct assistance, and they need it now.”
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who this week began to urge that the government send $1,000 to every American, also drew a distinction between an emergency measure and the movement for a guaranteed income.
Romney’s office said he used the $1,000 number as a starting point for discussions. Yet it was the $1,000 number that reignited hope in advocates for guaranteed income because it harked back to the idea promoted by Yang. The entrepreneur argued during his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination that giving Americans $1,000 each month was a necessary financial cushion in a changing economy.
During the campaign, Yang predicted technology would lead to massive job reductions. In an interview, he said this pandemic might accelerate those predictions. He said he hopes the crisis will compel conservatives to take his ideas more seriously, and recently reached out to Romney and the White House.
After the pandemic subsides, Yang said he figures there will be fundamental changes in the economy. For example, he noted he had a friend who laid off all 10 of his employees.
“When [the economy] comes back, is he going to employ all 10 people again? Maybe,” Yang said. “But who knows how his business will look? Is it possible that, during these two to three months, it will be possible for him to find different ways to get things done [without all 10 employees]? Sure. There’s going to be scenarios like that playing out across the economy.”
Tubbs said one the challenge will be bridging the need for cash now with the idea that residents need it regularly.
“I am not trying to fight with Mitt Romney, I support what he’s doing,” Tubbs said. “Give emergency cash. Once we do that, we’ll see that giving cash actually works and will help people in the next emergency.”
Although the concept of guaranteed income is becoming increasingly popular, there have been few examples to illustrate its effects on families. Programs such as the one in Stockton are relatively new and limited in scope, and opponents worry that a national program would add billions to the deficit while offering too little oversight. Skeptics also contend recipients might abuse the privilege of getting free money.
The Stockton families — all near or below the median income — have been receiving $500 checks since February 2019. The 18-month experiment is being supported by the Economic Security Project, a nonprofit started by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Another program, in Jackson, Miss., is providing $1,000 to black mothers living in subsidized housing.
Although the program is still in the process of analyzing data, participants are reporting a newfound sense of stability and psychological well-being, the director of the program said. One participant said the extra money allowed him to cut back his part-time jobs so he had time to look for full-time work. Others have reported being able to buy dentures and pay down credit card debts.
Since the pandemic started, at least one participant has reported losing a job. Some, such as Virginia Medina, a 62-year-old retired administrative assistant, said the effects of having guaranteed income over the past year have provided some relief.
Medina’s proof is in her refrigerator, her garage and her cabinets, she said. She has a stockpile of tortillas and tilapia, fresh and frozen vegetables and canned beans.
“It looks like we will be able to have enough food for nine months!” she recalled her 22-year-old son telling her.
Then, she considered the potential long-term effects of this period. She received a pension from the state, but her son was working a temp job at a packaging plant. He was still allowed to work after his staff checked his temperature to ensure he had no fever — but who knew how long that would last. Her stepson also lost his job, and he had a family to feed. The demands, she figured, would grow even greater.
“We would last maybe four months,” Medina told her son. She added: “This extra money is helping keep us afloat.”"
"March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mike-bloomberg-transfers-his-campaign-assets-to-democratic-party-to-fight-president-trump-in-swing-states/2020/03/20/43c62d60-6927-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html,The Washington Post,Mike Bloomberg transfers his campaign assets to Democratic Party to fight President Trump in swing states,"Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has decided to donate significant components of his shuttered presidential campaign to the Democratic Party, a historic bequest that includes an $18 million cash infusion to organize for the general election in swing states.
The decision, which exploits a provision in campaign finance law available only to federal candidates, amounts to a shift in strategy for the billionaire political activist, who had previously promised to personally fund ground staff and offices in six states through an independent expenditure effort.
He now hopes that much of the same operation will be run through the state and national Democratic Party, which would allow for it to directly coordinate with the Democratic nominee, whom he expects to be former vice president Joe Biden. An independent expenditure campaign is barred from such coordination.
“While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,” Bloomberg’s campaign wrote in a memo Friday to Democratic Party Chairman Tom Perez.
“Since Mike suspended his campaign and endorsed Joe Biden, the former vice president now controls the race. It is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party’s general election efforts.”
To accomplish the goal, Bloomberg will transfer cash remaining in his presidential campaign account, which he donated, to the Democratic National Committee’s Battleground Build-Up 2020 effort for use in the general election. The money will allow the party to hire hundreds of additional organizers, party officials say. Bloomberg also will transfer the long-term leases he has signed on some offices in some swing states to state Democratic parties.
Bloomberg’s advisers plan to work with the DNC on shifting staff from his payroll to the party. All personnel would have to reapply for their jobs, and those hired by the party will be paid at DNC salary levels, according to a party official. Bloomberg was previously paying $6,000 a month for organizers, well above the market rates offered for other campaigns.
“Our country is in crisis, and a change in presidential leadership is more important now than ever to protect our families, our communities and our economy,” Perez said in a statement. “With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump.”
But the transition will be disruptive for hundreds of Bloomberg organizers in swing states. They were previously told their jobs would continue through the general election, but they now find themselves facing the prospect of unemployment amid an economic crisis brought about by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Organizers received an email Friday saying their jobs would end that day, though they will continue to receive pay through April 7 and health benefits through April 30.
“As a token of our appreciation, we are offering you the opportunity to keep your laptop and iPhone,” said one email from the Bloomberg campaign to organizers. The email also noted that the value of the devices, $1,400 or $1,700, depending on the laptop, will be counted as taxable income.
Under normal circumstances, federal rules allow individuals to give a maximum of $355,000 per year to the DNC. The party has set up a Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee with state parties, that allows wealthy individuals to give $865,000 in one year. Bloomberg has already donated the maximum allowed to this account.
But the new shift of resources means he is able to give more than 20 times the maximum a donor can give to the national party in one year, because of provisions that allow federal candidates to donate unlimited amounts of leftover money to national and state parties as they wind down their campaigns. This has effectively given Bloomberg a super-donor status because he self-funded his White House bid.
Campaign finance experts said such a mass transfer of personal money was uncharted territory.
“This has never, to my knowledge, been an issue before, because anybody other than somebody worth multiple billions would want their money back even if they self-funded,” said Charlie Spies, a campaign finance lawyer who served as counsel for Mitt Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign.
If someone mounted a self-funded bid solely to evade the individual contribution limit and donate leftover campaign funds to the party, that would be considered a straw donation scheme, experts said.
But Bloomberg is shuttering a real campaign effort, and his decisions point to a loophole in the federal law that wealthy self-funded candidates can exploit, experts said.
“I think it’d be absolutely wrong to suggest that it’s a ploy to get around the limits. . . . But it does suggest you could do that,” said Beth Kingsley, a campaign finance lawyer at Harmon, Curran, Spielberg and Eisenberg. “It does seem that there ought to be limits the same way there’s an individual [contribution] limit.”
The Federal Election Commission does not have a voting quorum currently and cannot conduct official business, such as providing guidance on this matter.
Although Bloomberg’s plans to establish a new independent expenditure campaign have been put on hold, his advisers continue to look at possible vehicles for a media campaign to support the Democratic nominee later this year. A super PAC he used in 2018 to support House candidates, Independence USA, still exists, and he still has the capability to form a new group.
Since leaving the race earlier this month, Bloomberg has announced a broad range of donations to the larger Democratic cause, including $2 million for black voter registration and $2 million to Swing Left, which is working to elect Democrats to Republican-held seats in 2020 up and down the ballot in 12 states.
During his brief campaign, Bloomberg spent $225 million on television ads and $46.9 million on anti-Trump digital ads, according to the campaign’s own accounting. He spent more than $510 million on his campaign before dropping out of the race, according to public records.
He has previously committed at least $100 million to anti-Trump digital advertising in swing states through November, along with at least $15 million more to expand voter registration and protect voter access across the country."

Not this year. Add America’s Tax Day to the list of events that have been postponed as governments, businesses and people reorder day-to-day life to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. American taxpayers will be allowed to keep any money they owe the U.S. government for a few more months.
1. When do Americans have to pay their taxes?
The Treasury Department is giving individuals and corporations an additional three months -- until July 15 -- to file their returns and pay their tax bills. The government is hoping that this will help companies and people who could be facing a short-term cash flow shortage get through the coming weeks until it’s safe to resume normal economic activity. There also was concern that it could be difficult or unsafe for people to met with their tax preparer before April 15 while most schools and many businesses are shut down to prevent the spread of the virus.
2. Does this apply to state tax returns as well?
Not uniformly. Several states, including Maryland, California, Connecticut and Oregon have delayed some deadlines, giving taxpayers more time to submit the paperwork and come up with the cash. Other states are still formulating their plans and deadlines. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is keeping a running list of state and city tax deadline extensions.
3. Can I get an extension?
In a normal year, the Internal Revenue Service will atomatically grant a six-month filing extension, no questions asked, giving Americans until October 15 to file their returns. But the extension does not apply to the money owed, so interest and penalties accrue once the payment deadline -- April 15 normally -- passes. Whether extensions will be so leniently granted this year, and how long they’d be for, are still to be determined. Last year, a record 15 million taxpayers requested the six-month filing extension. Accountants had expected that even more would request one this year.
4. What will this mean for the U.S. economy?
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin estimates that the payment delay will inject about $300 billion in liquidity into the economy as individuals (wealthy ones, generally speaking) and companies keep their money longer. Most middle- and lower-income people don’t owe a tax bill -- they get a refund instead. They can, and usually do, file early in the tax season to get their hands on their refund checks as quickly as possible.
5. Will tax refunds be delayed?
Though the IRS is cutting staff in half at some of its processing centers, that shouldn’t have a significant impact on refund timing, according to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. The agency recommends filing as soon as possible, submitting your return electronically and opting to get the refund via direct deposit, rather than by check, to get your refund as quickly as possible. The IRS says the average time to get a refund is three weeks."

Where is Trump’s wartime response?,"A TROUBLESOME bottleneck threatens to undermine all the hard work of health-care workers and others to respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Reports from across the country reveal dire shortages of personal protective equipment, including masks, chemical reagents needed for testing and other supplies essential to coping with an expected onslaught of illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been reduced to suggesting scarves and bandannas where masks are unavailable.
The dimensions of the supply problem approach wartime in size and scope. No one was prepared for a pandemic; now everyone must shoulder extra effort. The government has estimated that if the pandemic lasts a year, 3.5 billion respirator masks may be necessary to protect health-care workers and patients. The United States has about 12 million N95 respirators and 30 million surgical masks, with an additional 5 million N95 respirators that may be expired. This is not enough. Already, at major hospitals in Seattle and the District, mask shortages have become so acute that doctors and patients are being asked to reuse them, not dispose of them as previous guidance from the CDC recommended.
At a Los Angeles emergency room, doctors were given a box of expired masks and when they tried to put them on, the elastic bands snapped, the New York Times reports. At Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan, doctors were informed they were down to one week’s supply of respirator masks.
Masks and other equipment are necessary to protect front-line health-care workers from infection. If they are sickened, the whole system could buckle. A surgeon told the Times, “We are at war with no ammo.”
Shortages are also reported in the chemicals known as reagents for virus test kits that isolate fragments of the virus’s genetic material. The International Reagent Resource, established by the CDC, is a system that distributes the chemicals and assures quality. But sources told The Post there are shortages and the supply chain is backed up. Also running out are the swabs needed to carry out the tests. Again, these supplies are the linchpin in any successful effort to carry out widespread testing to blunt the spread of covid-19.
President Trump suggested in a news conference this week that the shortages are a problem for the governors to deal with. “The federal government’s not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping,” he said. “You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.” Then on Friday he said the government had ordered the production of millions of masks and that these would be delivered directly to states. He offered contradictory statements about the Defense Production Act, a 1950 law allowing the government to address supply shortages by giving directives to industry to ramp up production, first asserting he had invoked its authority and then saying he had not used it because companies had responded voluntarily.
We are told that factories making masks are already running at full tilt; it may take time and investment to create new assembly lines to manufacture needed supplies. Instead of passing the buck to governors, Mr. Trump ought to deploy every tool at his disposal to address the shortages now.
If this is a wartime scale of a problem, where is the wartime response?"

The Montgomery County Council’s reaction to the proposed budget irritates. Council Vice President Tom Hucker (D-District 5), however, had the reasonable response: first, read it and understand its underpinnings, and then decisions can be made.
No one wants a tax increase.  But we all want the services. A proposed budget necessarily and professionally anticipates community needs and lays those out.
It is the council members’ job to weigh needs and priorities against tax rates. To instead draw angry (political posturing?) lines before digesting the full proposal is needlessly antagonistic and, therefore, counterproductive. I expect better from my council.
The council members’ complaints about timing relative to the novel coronavirus outbreak are also false issues. The budget date is a statutory requirement; every council member knows that. And odds are, 12 months from now, we will still be dealing with virus fallout; council members should know that, too.
Let’s not be disingenuous, council members. Just buckle down and do your job."

Industry group Financial Innovation Now urged Congress in a letter to provide capital to online lenders including PayPal and Square Inc., and to permit the firms to disperse Small Businesses Administration loans. The group’s members also include Inuit Inc. and Stripe Inc.
“Any federal small-business loan program must leverage digital advances in the marketplace to ensure that stimulus can reach those business most in need,” Financial Innovation Now said in its letter. “Millions of truly small businesses, those most likely to fail in the coming weeks, will not be well-served by loan guarantees made available exclusively through financial institutions.”
Last week, President Donald Trump said the SBA would provide low-interest loans in affected states and asked Congress to boost funding for the program by $50 billion. Small businesses are losing 80% to 100% of their revenue amid the pandemic, according to another fintech trade group, Innovative Lending Platform Association.
“If they all go out of business, we can’t serve them in the future,” Scott Stewart, chief executive officer of ILPA, said in an interview. “We don’t care about making any money on this, but we want to keep them alive so that when this is all wrapped up we can be lending to them in the long term.”
Many small businesses have only 10 days of cash on hand or less, according to Sam Taussig, head of global policy at Kabbage Inc., an online lender. While SBA loans can take as long as 90 days, fintech firms are touting their ability to process loans in days or weeks.

The S&P 500 Index sank 15 percent to the lowest level since February 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 17 percent, ending the week at 19,174 after losing more than 4,000 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 13 percent.
An air of calm that had appeared to be settling on the market was broken Friday as investors reevaluated the extent of the harm the covid-19 outbreak could do to the economy amid increasing government-mandated measures to increase social distancing. New York state ordered all nonessential workers to stay home. Neighboring New Jersey followed hours later. California’s governor issued a similar directive a day earlier.
All 11 main S&P 500 industry groups recorded double-digit declines for the week.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he wanted to finalize an agreement by Friday, but the Republican and Democratic senators working out the details called it a night without a final deal. They promised to return Saturday to continue talks, with the goal to vote Monday.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wants an expanded package that would spend far more on workers and on responding to the health care crisis, while Mnuchin wants more to bolster the economy, including direct payments to more Americans, according to people familiar with his thinking.
“Both sides have issues that they have to go back and check on” with their parties, Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said Friday night. “We’re going to be here early tomorrow morning.”
White House legislative liaison Eric Ueland told reporters at the Capitol that negotiators made progress the provisions regarding unemployment insurance and some of the other sticking points.
“This is not a situation where we are claiming a deal tonight,” Ueland said, adding that there is broad consensus on the need to act quickly. “We’re going to persevere tomorrow.”
The legislation will be the third measure from the U.S. Congress to soften the economic blow from the coronavirus that has swept the globe, sent markets plunging and constricted much of the world’s economy. Even as Democrats rejected the Republican draft bill released Thursday, lawmakers of both parties recognized the need to act quickly with a massive infusion of federal money into a U.S. economy that has ground to a halt.
“We’re talking about a bill that at minimum is a trillion dollars,” Ueland said earlier Friday. “I understand the potential for the deficit impact. But the deficit impact is not a barrier to the need to act on behalf of the American people.
Another Round
President Donald Trump, at a White House briefing, indicated he’d be willing to come back to Congress again for another round of stimulus if necessary.
“I want to get workers money,” Trump said, adding if there’s not enough money in this round of stimulus, “we’ll do something later, I’m sure.”
The impact of the virus is roiling markets worldwide. The S&P 500 Index tumbled to its lowest in three years, ending the week down 15%. The European Union said the recession this year may be as bad as 2009, and Goldman Sachs warned the U.S. economy may shrink 24% on an annualized basis in the second quarter.
McConnell and Schumer have each proposed their own sweeping plans that four groups of senators spent much of Friday trying to reconcile. Schumer spoke with Trump Friday, and both Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke several times with Mnuchin.

The GOP proposal includes tiered tax rebates of as much as $1,200 for middle-income individuals, $208 billion worth of loans for companies suffering because of the coronavirus pandemic and another $300 billion dedicated to smaller businesses.
Mnuchin has proposed two $1,000 checks at a cost of about $500 billion -- substantially more generous than McConnell’s bill. Those direct payments wouldn’t be based on income level, as in the GOP proposal.
Lawmakers on Friday were nearing an agreement to give low-income individuals the full tax rebate, rather than the smaller amount in the GOP version, according to multiple people familiar with the talks. They also were close on an increased unemployment insurance, a central Democratic ask. The two issues appear to be intertwined, and final numbers for the emergency benefits will in part depend on what feedback negotiators receive from other senators, as well as the administration and potentially House leadership.
Democratic Pushback
The House of Representatives, meanwhile, remains out of session. With Pelosi working through Schumer, the main negotiating in the Capitol this weekend will be senator to senator.
Schumer initially said the Republican proposal doesn’t go far enough and “it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers.”
A major sticking point is a Democratic demand for additional emergency funding to states. Ueland told reporters that he estimates states have an aggregate of $50 billion in rainy day funds. But certain states, like Illinois, have precarious debt or budget situations like to be exacerbated by the sudden drop in economic activity.
Democrats also are seeking to add aid for hospitals and other health-care facilities that are increasingly burdened by patients with the virus.
On Friday evening, three Senate Democrats -- Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Jeff Merkley of Oregon proposed $600 billion in grants and loans to small and medium-sized businesses -- double what McConnell requested.
Smaller businesses would get grants from the Treasury to cover expenses, which could convert to loans if they fail to meet requirements.
‘Not So Far Away’
In Schumer’s earlier phone conversations with Trump, he urged the president to immediately use the Defense Production Act to get ventilators and other important equipment. Trump said at the White House briefing that he was doing that.
Schumer also brought up several of the Democratic priorities and Schumer’s office characterized Trump as willing to listen.
Schumer and Trump also agree on prohibiting stock buybacks of companies getting aid -- something Trump has now publicly endorsed -- and Schumer also wants to prohibit layoffs, increasing executive pay or cutting salaries.
Asked at the White House briefing whether he and Schumer are on the same page, Trump responded, “We’re not so far away.”
Legislative Text
Ueland on Friday said the negotiations between Republicans, Democrats and the White House can’t go on forever because staff members will have to actually write the bill so that it can be voted on Monday.
“With the way the schedule is now accelerated in the Senate, the Senate needs to begin drafting legislative text, and they’ll turn to that next,” he said.
“Obviously Republicans have some ideas, Democrats have others but that’s the way the system works. We’re trying to put them together today,” Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the bill as a good start but was planning to send a letter to Congress suggesting a program for loans to mid-size and larger employees, Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley told reporters on Friday.
Bradley outlined a program for businesses of more than 500 employees that have revenue losses of at least 10% due to the virus. The loans would be federally guaranteed and paid back over five years, and a portion would be forgiven for maintaining a certain level of head count."
"March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/for-want-of-widgets-exporters-hit-by-china-factory-shutdown-race-to-shore-up-supplies/2020/02/06/f13f7602-47f0-11ea-91ab-ce439aa5c7c1_story.html,The Washington Post,Exporters hit by China’s virus shutdown race to shore up supplies,"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — The extended shutdown of Chinese factories from the coronavirus outbreak is upsetting supply chains as manufacturers feel the pinch from shortages of material and travel restrictions on staff.
In Vietnam, which shares an 800-mile border with China and is home to many businesses that export to the United States, companies say the squeeze is compounding pressure caused by President Trump’s trade war with Beijing.
Despite Vietnam’s close economic and tourism ties with China, the human cost of the coronavirus outbreak in this country of nearly 100 million remains small, with 12 confirmed infections. But for companies with Chinese staff, or those reliant on materials and equipment from China, the pain is real.
Kaiser Furniture, a Taiwanese-owned manufacturer that has operated in Vietnam since 2004, falls into both of those categories. The company, which sells 95 percent of its furniture to the United States, has over 3.2 million square feet of production facilities and roughly 5,000 employees in Binh Duong province, a heavily industrialized region outside Ho Chi Minh City.
Dwayne Wood, Kaiser’s general manager of sales and marketing, says 120 of its workers are from mainland China, 50 of whom are trapped in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. The employees had been visiting home for the Lunar New Year holiday when the virus began to spread rapidly, prompting Chinese authorities to place Hubei under an unprecedented lockdown.
“They are all senior and middle managers,” Wood said. “Our production scheduling guys, our entire costing department. A couple of our purchasing people and two senior managers at our upholstery area are stuck, so we’re having to move things around to be able to get those areas to work.”
Other Chinese employees of Kaiser were able to return to Vietnam before flights between the two countries were suspended last weekend, though some had to fly via Malaysia or South Korea. Now, Vietnam is no longer granting new visas to Chinese nationals, and anyone arriving in the country who has been in China within the last two weeks faces 14 days in quarantine.
While travel restrictions have created personnel problems, Wood said, broader issues are gaining prominence.
“The bigger impact for us is that China really just hasn’t started back up [since the end of the holiday], and China is such a huge trading partner, and we still rely heavily on them for a lot of our component parts,” he said.
Furniture production for the U.S. market is well-established in Vietnam, with large-scale manufacturing dating back two decades.
While Vietnam’s economy has diversified and grown rapidly in recent years, driven in part by rising labor costs in China, businesses still rely on the huge Chinese industrial sector to churn out essential components. For Kaiser, that means parts such as drawer guides and specific fabrics or leather, though most of the lumber it uses is American.
“The biggest disruption of the coronavirus for a lot of people here will be how it affects the supply chain. It was already a stretch with Lunar New Year; our customers placed extra orders early to compensate for the break . . . But now we’re back, and we’re trying to contact our vendors in China, and they’re not even back to work,” Wood said.
Others in Vietnam say they have not felt the full force of disruptions but worry that it’s only a matter of time.
An executive at a large American footwear company based in Ho Chi Minh City said that while the business is not experiencing problems yet, managers are monitoring the supply chain closely.
“A lot of the athletic brands have already started moving out of China, but a lot of technical materials, whether knits or carbon plates, things like that, haven’t completely migrated out of China yet,” said the manager, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
These parts are largely produced in Guangdong province, home to the industrial powerhouses of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, a region that so far has avoided significant disruptions from the outbreak. Nonetheless, the footwear producer is exploring contingency plans with other suppliers. Its factories outside Ho Chi Minh City have distributed masks and hand sanitizer to workers, while also quarantining Chinese employees for 14 days.
“There have been concerns voiced by the Vietnamese workers, some of which is perpetuating something kind of stereotypical, but we want the factories to be super transparent,” the executive said.
The footwear firm is not alone in taking such a step. The labor department in Ho Chi Minh City has ordered 187 companies to keep 1,069 Chinese employees in quarantine for two weeks.
New restrictions within China could further stress production lines. This week, officials in Zhejiang province announced that only one person per household would be allowed to leave home every two days for necessities. This includes three districts of the city of Hangzhou, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba.
“We’ve also heard that Hangzhou is telling factories they can’t open until March 1, and that’s a really key fabric area,” Wood said. “If that happens, then we’ll be greatly affected.”
Although China has largely weathered Trump’s trade war, many economists expect its annual growth to slump to below 4 percent for the first quarter as services halt and consumers avoid going out due to contagion fears.
“The tariffs have had a great impact on the exodus of manufacturing from China, but it’s been kind of a slow death, whereas if something like this happens where they’re physically not able to go back to work, it really forces people to quickly change their mind-set and move away from China at a much faster pace,” Wood said."
"March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/21/2020-presidential-candidates-campaign-spending-february/,The Washington Post,The most interesting takeaways from how 2020 candidates spent their money in February,"The latest campaign finance filings are in, finally giving us answers to some of our burning questions before most of the Democratic presidential candidates dropped out of the race.
Here are the most interesting takeaways we found from the newest filings made public Friday night, covering the month of February 2020.
1. Bloomberg donated nearly $1 billion to his three-month campaign.
By the time multibillionaire Mike Bloomberg suspended his self-funded campaign after three months, we knew he had spent at least $510 million. But a new filing shows Bloomberg gave $935.3 million of his own money to his short-lived White House bid.
Of that donation, his campaign spent at least $876 million, and more than half of that amount — $467 million — was spent in February alone, the filing shows. Bloomberg, who ran an ad-focused campaign aimed at Super Tuesday states, spent $360 million in ads last month.
Bloomberg dropped out on March 4, after faring poorly on Super Tuesday. On Friday, he donated $18 million of his leftover campaign money to the Democratic National Committee, taking advantage of a campaign finance loophole thanks to his wealth.
2. One megadonor mostly funded the pro-Warren super PAC.
It turns out that one Silicon Valley megadonor plowed $14.6 million into a super PAC that boosted Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as she struggled financially toward the tail end of her candidacy.
The donor was Karla Jurvetson, a physician and one of Warren’s longtime allies. Her donation made up the vast majority of the $15.1 million the Persist PAC pulled in just 11 days in February.
Warren, a central tenet of whose campaign was about the corrupting power of money and who initially rejected the help of super PACs, dramatically reversed her stance after the group formed. Super PACs raise and spend unlimited amounts of money and act independently of the campaigns.
Jurvetson, one of the biggest Democratic donors, was tied to a so-called dark money nonprofit that ran a pro-Warren ad in Iowa. The group, Women. Vote, does not disclose its donors. Jurvetson also helped Warren access the Democratic voter file by donating to the Democratic National Committee — a move that was at odds with Warren’s pledge not to lean on wealthy donors during her presidential bid.
3. Biden’s small-dollar fundraising improved a lot in February.
Former vice president Joe Biden had failed to gain traction among small-dollar donors throughout the campaign, especially compared to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and President Trump, both of whom are prolific small-dollar fundraisers.
But in February, Biden’s small-dollar fundraising greatly improved: For the first time, more than 45 percent of his donations came from those giving $200 or less. This is comparable to the small-dollar share that Trump tends to draw every month.
Biden posted his best month in February, drawing $18 million overall even as he performed poorly in three of the four primary contests that month.
Meanwhile, the pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, drew $4.2 million that month, comprising nearly half of the money it has raised so far in the campaign. Among the biggest donors to the super PAC last month were LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman ($1 million) and Yaron Minsky with Jane Street, a stock-exchange trading firm ($1 million).
4. Sanders’s fundraising ballooned, but his voting base did not.
Sanders posted an eye-popping $48 million last month, with just over half of that coming from small-dollar donations.
But despite his sustained strength among small-dollar donors, often seen as a proxy for grass roots support, that has not translated to delegates.
It’s yet another sign that money is just one part of the equation for electoral success. Despite being the standout fundraiser of the Democratic presidential primaries so far, Sanders faces a narrower path to the Democratic nomination than he did four years ago.
5. Trump and the GOP continue to outstrip Democrats.
President Trump has a fundraising advantage, as the incumbent who began raising reelection money far earlier than any of his predecessors.
Last month, the GOP continued to gain fundraising strength as the Democratic candidates faced their first four primary contests. The RNC raised $22.7 million in February. The Trump campaign and two affiliated fundraising committees together raised more than $86 million in February, according to Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale.
Of course, this was before the coronavirus became a global pandemic, upending the way campaigns raise and spend their money.
The Democratic National Committee raised $11.8 million last month, and brought in another $852,000 through the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, an affiliated fundraising committee.
DNC officials said they saw a surge in donations in March, as the moderate base consolidated around Biden’s candidacy, and said they expect to post the party’s best fundraising month of the cycle in March."

JPMorganChase projects that gross domestic product may shrink 14 percent between now and the end of June. Picture your local area as it was a couple of weeks ago, with its shops, factories and farms; now, imagine one-seventh of all that activity gone, with more damage, possibly, to come.
No one has a certain template for how to limit the harm — least of all ourselves. It is both urgent and possible to define the predicament correctly, however. The United States is not confronted with a financial crisis and a follow-on crisis of demand, as in 2008 or 1929. Rather, previously robust consumption and production are being deliberately halted to save lives. Thus,traditional tools of monetary and fiscal stimulus, such as zero interest rates and direct cash aid to households, are unlikely to prove decisive. You can’t shop, or invest in new construction, while on lockdown.
The vital need of everyone in the economy, from the corner drugstore to the local transit authority to the mightiest multinational, is liquidity: credit to meet payroll and other key obligations so as to remain solvent until the end of what we all must hope is a finite crisis.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) $1 trillion initial proposal seems realistically sized but poorly conceived. Where cash relief must be reserved for the poorest and those newly jobless, his package would deliver less of it to the bottom of the income scale than to the middle. Where the private sector as a whole needs quick and, above all, flexible access to credit, the proposal would assign $150 billion on a sectoral basis, to airlines, hotels and others admittedly hard-hit. Potentially complex rules would apply to $300 billion set aside for qualifying small businesses.
Far better to use the Federal Reserve’s power to act as a lender of last resort, not only to the financial sector, as in past crises — and as it is already doing now — but to business generally, using the existing commercial banking system as intermediary. Congress’s part would be to provide a large pool of capital to support such loans, which, as former Fed official Kevin Warsh and others have suggested, would charge interest and require collateral to protect taxpayers against inevitable losses.
This would both permit and incentivize companies and lenders to shape cash relief in the economically most sustainable manner. It would be self-limiting in duration; presumably the need for emergency credit would dissipate as the emergency does. Like the successful Troubled Asset Relief Program in the Great Recession, this aid, too, would be paid back.
Yes, very general conditions — limits to executive pay, for example — should be attached to whatever private sector relief goes out. This is not, however, the time to cry “bailout” or impose accountability for alleged past irresponsibility such as stock buybacks. The big picture, right now, is that U.S. companies, small and large, have behaved responsibly — giving up revenue and profits for the sake of public health. Helping them get through this crisis will help everyone get through it."

They emphasize the need for people to act voluntarily in the interest of the common good. That is the right approach. Government should not strangle the society it is trying to save.
The pandemic is hitting some hot spots hard, including New York and Washington state. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said more than half his state could become infected in eight weeks if the spread cannot be slowed. All we know about how the virus spreads — through people coughing and exhaling viral particles, or touching contaminated surfaces — indicates that social distancing and avoiding crowds can slow transmission and avert catastrophic overload of hospitals and health-care facilities.
Throngs at bars, restaurants and on the beaches of Florida in recent days set off alarms that perhaps the public was not heeding public health warnings. About one quarter of Californians were already under local “shelter in place” orders when Mr. Newsom issued his demand that people stay home, except for those needed for key infrastructure jobs such as water, energy and communications. Mr. Newsom said he hopes not to have to use law enforcement for compliance. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York called for putting the state on “pause,” ordering nonessential businesses to close and urging workers to stay home but leaving open grocery stores, banks, pharmacies and other businesses. Illinois and Pennsylvania followed suit with similar measures. Asked about a nationwide shelter-in-place order, President Trump reassuringly said on Friday, “I don’t think we’ll ever find that necessary.”
Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that “there are places, regions, states, cities in this country that are being stressed much, much more than the country as a whole,” and said he “strongly supports” the moves. From a public health standpoint, the disruption caused by social distancing is worth it; the sacrifices are temporary and far less painful than thousands of deaths, overrun hospitals and a runaway virus.
But this is every bit as much about human behavior as about public health. It is absolutely essential in the months ahead that political leaders retain people’s trust — not an easy task even in normal times. If the restrictions are draconian, they could boomerang. People may panic or be tempted to disobey. That would in turn threaten further spread of the virus. Political leaders must allow a society to breathe, not only fresh air in parks and playgrounds, but also to go about life as normally as possible, to have access to groceries, banks, pharmacies and other essential services. It is important that leaders retain credibility so that the next time they ask for emergency action, they are heeded.
The word “lockdown” suggests jail. The concept is hardly what the United States needs at this juncture. We need careful, clear public health decisions to guide us back to normal as soon as possible."
"March 22, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/mnuchin-sees-emergency-aid-package-on-track-for-monday-passage/2020/03/22/76587084-6c43-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html,The Washington Post,Mnuchin Sees Emergency Package on Track for Monday Passage,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration is nearing agreement with Congressional leaders from both parties on a massive aid program aimed at supporting the U.S. economy through the next 10 to 12 weeks.
“We have a fundamental understanding, and we look forward to wrapping it up today,” he said on “Fox News Sunday,” adding, “I hope this gets passed on Monday, because we need the money now.”
The plan would include aid to small businesses to help retain workers, direct cash payments to some Americans, enhanced unemployment insurance, a “significant new liquidity package in coordination with the Federal Reserve,” and financial support for hospitals.
Stimulus Components
The package is designed to address the impact of the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic. The deadly contagion has sent markets plunging, eliminating gains in U.S. stocks made during the first three years of Trump’s term, and brought much of the economy to a near standstill.
Mnuchin said the administration will seek additional aid if the emergency persists. “If this lasts longer, we’ll come back again,” he said.
Mnuchin outlined the following details on the package now working its way through Congress:
• Small business retention loans: Loans to small businesses covering two weeks of payroll and “some overhead” expenses.
• The loans would be forgiven for companies that retain their workers.
• Eligible companies account for about half of the U.S. workforce, according to Mnuchin.
• Direct cash payments for some Americans, totaling about $3,000 to the average family of four.
• Enhanced unemployment insurance for workers laid off because of the coronavirus.
• Approval for the Fed to launch new emergency lending facilities mobilizing “up to $4 trillion of liquidity” -- though it was unclear whether that included emergency programs already announced by the central bank
• Mnuchin says it will be a broad-based program “to help everything from small businesses to big businesses get through the next 90 to 120 days.”
• A “small component” for airlines and national security companies.
• Approximately $110 billion for hospitals and medical professionals.
Sudden Shock
The U.S. looks certain to experience an enormous and sudden economic contraction as businesses close and Americans stay home. Mnuchin said the issue of whether the economy is now in recession was a “technical question” and added that U.S. growth would bounce back “significantly” when businesses reopen.
By some estimates, the economy may suffer its worst quarter in records dating to 1947. JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects gross domestic product to shrink at an annualized rate of 14% in the April-June period while Bank of America Corp. and Oxford Economics both see a 12% drop. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees a 24% plunge.
Goldman Sachs projected jobless claims would surge to a record 2.25 million in the week ended March 21, while Bank of America projects 3 million and Citigroup 4 million. That compares with 281,000 in the prior week and would be more than triple the record 695,000 during one week in 1982."
"March 22, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-transit-must-survive-the-virus/2020/03/22/2f4ecc62-6af7-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html,The Washington Post,Why transit must survive the virus,"AMERICA’S URBAN transit systems, the sinews that bind together cities, are in a coronavirus free fall. Some, like Washington’s Metro, mindful of public health warnings against people congregating, have been aggressively discouraging passengers, accelerating the pandemic’s impact on ridership. Others, such as San Francisco’s BART network, tried until a few days ago to encourage riders to return, assuring them that trains would not be crowded. Both, like every other transit system, are suffering plummeting revenue and shaky futures — a prognosis shared by cities themselves.
It’s critical that transit systems keep running, even as riderships fall by as much as 90 percent from pre-pandemic levels. And none may be as critical as Metro, on which the federal government, including the Pentagon and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Washington office, continues to rely, albeit at drastically reduced in-office staffing.
Transit is not an urban amenity; it’s life support for people who need it to access groceries, dialysis and jobs at hospitals whose continuing ability to address the crisis depends on employees showing up for work. But how long can it hold out?
In Detroit, bus drivers, furious that their buses had not been cleaned overnight last week, refused to come to work last Tuesday. Officials scrambled to fix the problem, and passengers were desperate. In New York, the nation’s biggest and busiest system, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is seeking a $4 billion bailout.
In Washington, Metro’s losses are $52 million monthly. Extrapolate that over a full year, and the red ink comes to more than $620 million, a major chunk of the agency’s $2 billion annual operating budget. Paul J. Wiedefeld, Metro’s general manager, asked the Washington area’s congressional delegation for help in a “dire” financial situation. At the moment, Metro may need to tap its line of credit to pay personnel — a costly means of borrowing and one that may only last six months or so.
Disappearing passengers is a challenge; it may not be the biggest one facing transit agencies. Their own employees are at no less risk of contracting the virus than the general public, and the consequences would be grim in the event of a contagious breakout among workers in, say, an operations control center.
Metro, among some other major systems, has established a parallel control center, fully staffed, 10 miles away from the preexisting one in the Maryland suburbs. The two facilities have been working in alternating shifts; if the virus takes down one, the other can take the reins.
At the moment, the mantra that “safety trumps service” is smart. Metro is assiduously warning against nonessential trips, including (or especially) to see the cherry blossoms. But just as there are essential jobs, a city needs to operate essential services even in an emergency. Those include sanitation, police and fire — as well as transit. The bottom line is this: In the absence of Metro, nothing — not the National Guard; not ride-sharing services; not bikes or mopeds — is a plausible substitute. Metro and other urban transit systems must survive because there is no Plan B."

“We don’t want that,” Trump said Thursday at a White House news conference. “Some companies, as you know, did stock buybacks. It’s very hard to tell them not to but I would tell them not to.”
He answered “I do, I really do” when asked whether he supports the U.S. taking equity stakes in companies that receive assistance, an idea that his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow publicly suggested on Wednesday.
Asked if he would ban buybacks and bonuses as a condition of a stimulus bill under development in Congress, Trump said: “It takes many, many people -- in this case -- to tango. Conditions like that would be O.K. with me.”
Trump later hinted that some companies now asking for the government’s assistance had previously engaged in buybacks, suggesting he’d be less willing to help them. Trump has been criticized for a wave of buybacks that followed his 2017 corporate income tax cut.
“People are coming in for money, in some cases no fault of their own but in some cases where they did certain things over the course of the years including buying back stock,” Trump said. “You know, they bought back stock and they paid a high price for it, as it turned out. Maybe I view that as a little bit differently than somebody that didn’t, than somebody that built plants all over the United States -- of which there were plenty of them too.”
Some of Trump’s Republican allies in Congress have begun to object to plans to provide grants to companies as part of the stimulus, characterizing them as corporate bailouts. Trump said he aims to help workers, not companies.
“We don’t want to pick winners and losers,” he said. “We want everybody to benefit.”
Trump said he intends to help the airline, cruise ship and hotel industries. The president’s company, the Trump Organization, operates hotels in Washington, D.C, New York, Las Vegas and elsewhere.
“Where jobs are created, you don’t want to lose industries like this. These are incredible industries, you can’t lose them. So we’ll be focused on many industries,” he said.
He also emphasized: “We will be helping small businesses.”"

And the accompanying economic crisis should have led to fast action to help Americans most vulnerable to the ravages of lost jobs and lost income.
The early returns are not good on either front.
There is no need to elaborate on President Trump’s manifest unfitness for leadership. Every day brings more lying, more self-involvement, more pettiness and more lashing out at anyone who dares to point out how unprepared his administration left the ­country.
Thus, when Illinois Gov. J.B. ­Pritzker, a Democrat, told CNN on Sunday that the nation’s hospitals were running far short of safe gowns, surgical masks and gloves, and that “this should have been a coordinated effort by the federal government,” our petulant leader lashed out at Pritzker and the media on Twitter. They “shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings.” And never mind that it’s the governors and mayors who are saving us now. Here is an easy, efficient economic-stimulus idea: The president of the United States should just shut up for an extended period. (I never thought I’d have to say that.)
But, yes, the economy also needs Congress to pass practical measures to prevent economic collapse. So it was deeply discouraging that what might have been a bipartisan stimulus effort faltered Sunday when Senate Republicans insisted on including in their bill a $500 billion corporate bailout fund that would be administered by ­Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It contained few safeguards on how he would dole the money out, and Treasury wouldn’t disclose who it was helping for six months.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) characterized the plan as “a half-trillion dollar slush fund,” which seems entirely appropriate and doesn’t inspire confidence. No wonder, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) couldn’t muster the votes on Sunday evening to push his bill on. And his decision to keep House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at arm’s length may prove to be another miscalculation. Pelosi looked at what the GOP Senate was up to and, quite reasonably, said she wants the Democratic House to produce its own bill. This might yet push McConnell toward the fixes his proposal needs.
The simple truth is that the nation needs a huge stimulus bill because we are staring at an economic catastrophe. Greg Leiserson, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration now at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, laid out the imperatives: “Err on the side of being too big rather than too small, be sure help continues as long as it’s needed, and address the public health crisis.”
On size, the $1.8 trillion stimulus that the Senate is contemplating sounds big, but it may yet prove inadequate to the task. In response to demands from Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), some improvements were made on an earlier Republican proposal by substantially increasing funding for unemployment insurance and extending it over several months — but Schumer was right to say on Sunday that these provisions needed to be extended over a longer period and cover more people.
The final bill also needs more money to help states through what will be an enormous fiscal crisis — without it, layoffs will multiply. And it should step up the food stamp program that might also be extended to help renters facing eviction.
And Congress has to be creative to make sure the proposed one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child are not only allocated to the poorest people in the country (most were cut out of an earlier version of the proposal, since corrected) but also get to them fast. This will be challenging because millions among the very poor do not file income-tax returns. “You really need to get the money out as quickly as you can . . . and to use as many channels as you can to get the money out,” said Jacob Leibenluft, senior fellow at the Center for National Progress.
But this entire episode points to a glaring weakness of our nation’s economic policy: We should not be as dependent as we are on slapdash emergency action by Congress in a crisis.
Thus, one good thing that could come out of this emergency: a system that would automatically put stabilizers in place to keep a downturn from becoming a death spiral. Various forms of support — from unemployment insurance to food stamps to emergency aid to the states — should kick in when economic indicators turn negative. This would be good for needy individuals and families, but also for the economy as a whole.
But for now, Congress needs to focus urgently on the individuals, families, small businesses, health systems and charitable groups facing calamity. Negotiators pledged to work on. They must, because this is one time when they need to show us democracy’s best side."
"March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/23/retiree-investment-stock-market/,The Washington Post,"For retirees, the stock market crash carries an additional sting with RMDs","Unless stocks and stock funds have a miraculous recovery, some seniors are complaining they will be forced to withdraw money from their retirement accounts in a bear market.
Before a recent law change, people turning 70½ had to take required minimum distributions, or RMDs, from their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and/or workplace retirement plans such as a 401(k). The penalty for failing to take your RMD properly is substantial.
If you don’t take distributions, or if the distributions are not large enough, you’re subject to a penalty equal to 50 percent of the amount that should have been withdrawn.
Thanks to the Secure Act, which stands for Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement, if your 70th birthday is July 1, 2019 or later, you do not have to take withdrawals until you reach 72.
Many seniors won’t benefit from this break. They will have to take RMDs by the end of the year. Because the rules about RMDs were made to make people scream, an April 1 deadline approaching has some retirees fuming. Here’s why.
You have until April 1 of the following year after reaching the required RMD age to make your first RMD payment. This deadline applies only to the RMD for the first year. Every year thereafter, you have to take your distributions by Dec. 31.
Some folks who turned 70½ at the end of 2019 decided to delay their first payment until the upcoming April 1.
Here’s the problem. Because they carried over their required minimum distribution obligation from 2019 into 2020, they have to take two RMDs — one April 1 and the other by the end of this year.
Panicked at having to sell when the stock market is crashing many seniors are hoping Congress suspends their RMDs for 2020.
“Because of the precipitous drop in the stock market and the high 2019 end of year values that determines retirees’ 2020 RMD, taking a RMD in 2020 will be expensive,” wrote Catherine Dimino of Ashland, Ore. A stagnant end of the year market that continues to be stagnant isn’t the problem. The problem is an end of the year bull market followed by a precipitous drop in value. The government is currently providing relief for employees and businesses, but I haven’t seen any mention of retirees.”
Charlene Steinhauser of Florida wrote, “I am hoping that all RMDs will be suspended during the coronavirus pandemic.”
“I intend to write my congresswoman and senators requesting a waiver from RMD’s this year,” wrote Michael Grow from Richmond. “I don’t want to liquidate assets at distress prices.”
Suspending RMDs is not unprecedented. During the financial crisis when the stock market drastically dived, Congress suspended the RMDs for 2009. The waiver also applied to beneficiaries of an inherited retirement account.
Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) introduced legislation that would waive the required minimum distribution rules for retirement plans in 2020. Markey is trying to get the waiver included in the next stimulus bill being negotiated in Congress.
“From increased vulnerability to the virus, to the economic vulnerabilities facing their retirement accounts because of a sinking stock market, we must protect our seniors during this incredible time of need,” Markey said in a statement. “All Americans will require time and support to recover from this crisis, but seniors should not face unfair tax burdens due to this emergency.”
Because the 2020 RMD calculation is based on an account balance of December 31, 2019, seniors will be forced to deplete a far larger percentage of their retirement accounts than anticipated, or face penalties, Markey noted.
The AARP has also recommended Congress delay RMDs.
“Delaying distributions will allow retirees the opportunity to regain value in retirement plans that have recently suffered very large losses,” AARP said in a letter to congressional members.
A suspension of RMDs also would reduce income taxes at a time when many people may be experiencing financial trouble because of covid-19.
Here are the retirement accounts that fall under the RMD rules:
— Employer-sponsored retirement plans, including profit-sharing plans and 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b) plans.
— The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), the federal government’s version of a 401(k).
— Roth 401(k). Even though you don’t have to pay income tax on the withdrawal, you still have to take an RMD. A Roth IRA does not require withdrawals until after the death of the owner.
— Traditional IRA.
— Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) and Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE).
A delay in RMDs won’t benefit retirees who need to take a distribution because they require the income. But for those who can afford to put off a withdrawal, this relief would be a welcome move during a financially stressful time.
Reader Question of the Week
If you have a retirement question send it to colorofmoney@washpost.com. In the subject line put “Question of the Week.”
Q: We were planning on buying a house this spring. We have saved a 20 percent down payment and have a credit score in the high 700’s. But now that everything is changing in the day-to-day markets, we don’t know what to do. We have to move in June, but should we keep renting until things stabilize a bit? This is a very difficult decision for us.
This week’s answer comes from Carolyn McClanahan a physician turned certified financial planner who founded the fee-only Life Planning Partners based in Jacksonville, Fla.
McClanahan: Just like it is hard to time the stock market, it is difficult to time the real estate market. If we go into a recession, the price of homes may drop, so it would be a good time to buy. Hopefully, you are buying to live in the home for many years — that way, if there is a recession and no market for home sales for a number of years, you don’t have to worry about selling the home in a bad housing market. A home should be thought of as a use asset, not as an investment, because you have to live somewhere.

Retirement Rants and Raves
I’m also interested in your experiences or concerns about retirement or aging. You can rant or rave. In the subject line put “Retirement Rants and Raves.”
I’d like to leave you with this note from Susan: “Can you pat me on the head in these crazy times and tell me I’ve done at least some of what I should have? We’re retired five years in, don’t have a fantastic amount in our portfolio (used to be about $300,000, but God knows now. I haven’t looked in a month or two), have savings left to shore up pension and Social Security for a year or two. I’ve been rebalancing as the stock market has risen and we are about equally invested in equities and bonds/cash equivalents. I was hoping to start dipping into the 401(k) in 2022, but if necessary we could manage (though not easily) on Social Security and pension alone for a good while. I know there’s no guarantee of anything but maybe there’s a chance we might live to see our savings recover.”
Susan, it’s always good to plan for the worse and hope for the best. You definitely get a pat on the head for doing all that you can to weather this storm — however long it may last."
"March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/how-the-brussels-effect-helps-the-eu-rule-the-world/2020/03/21/97c494ea-6b31-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html,The Washington Post,How the ‘Brussels Effect’ Helps the EU Rule the World,"Where Europe leads, others follow -- at least when it comes to the rules of commerce. Why? Because the alternative could be too costly. Companies selling into multiple markets want a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and products, perhaps even more so in a world grappling with the Coronavirus, and that is effectively giving the European Union an edge in setting standards far beyond its borders. Even Brexit-bound Britain and trailblazing California are feeling the Brussels Effect.
1. What is the Brussels Effect?
It’s a term for the influence the EU exerts by shaping rules and technical standards adopted by companies and countries around the world. When YouTube pulls a video rant off its website, it’s using the EU’s definition of hate speech. Timber chopped down in Indonesia, honey harvested in Brazil and the amount of chemicals in Japanese toys all abide by rules set by Brussels. EU antitrust probes into Google’s business are mimicked by India, South Korea and even the U.S. The list goes on.
2. Why does the EU have so much influence?
Global companies can’t afford to ignore the terms set by one of their most important markets, says Columbia Law School Professor Anu Bradford who coined the term “Brussels Effect” in an article and a book. If businesses want to avoid producing different versions of the same product for different markets, many will take the EU line for a number of reasons. Legislation from the bloc of 27 nations can prove more flexible than that from other regions as the EU picks up what’s been trialed in its member states, such as privacy tested out in Germany or emissions trading programs in the U.K. European rules also need to be agreed by consensus, allowing a say for companies and consumer or environmental activists. What comes out sets a high standard that firms with global supply chains tend to accept.
3. What areas of business does it affect?
Pretty much everything. Companies wanting to prove their products use safe chemicals will follow the EU’s REACH rules. African farmers growing food that might be sold to Europe will shun genetically modified crops to comply with EU standards. Trees felled illegally can’t be made into products destined for Europe. Any business that collects and uses data (that’s most of them) knows of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, rules that limit what personal information can be gathered and stored. Looking ahead, energy efficiency and environmental rules to meet EU climate goals may also be adopted by companies and copied by countries across the globe.
4. What about its influence beyond business rules?
That’s another matter. Its support of human rights is often ignored and few countries seek to emulate its expensive and generous social security and health systems or high-wage labor market. The euro, overseen by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, has never seriously challenged the dollar as the world’s benchmark currency and the EU’s struggle to contain its own financial and debt crises have eroded its role as a global economic power. Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King argued in a Bloomberg Opinion column that for U.K. banks the partnership with the U.S. may offer a better hope for regulation than tying London to an EU model.
5. Is anyone driving the Brussels Effect?
The Brussels Effect, a variation of the ‘California Effect’ phenomenon also described in academic research, didn’t come about by design but the EU’s executive, the European Commission, is happy to show it off. It invites overseas officials to see how it works and explain its policies, for example telling China how Europe tries to keep state subsidies in check. Lobbyists from companies and governments around the world maintain offices in the Belgian capital.
6. What does Brexit mean for the Brussels Effect?
The U.K.’s move to quit the EU was partly predicated on the desire to make its own rules. Yet, according to Bradford, the country is likely to remain hooked into EU regulations as its businesses push for alignment to allow them to sell into the European market of 450 million people. When it comes to internal EU debate, Britain’s disappearance will eliminate a pro-market voice that often countered French and German pushes for greater regulation and intervention.
7. Is Europe going to stay influential?
The EU isn’t leading the rule-making in every area, particularly emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence that are dominated by Chinese and American companies. Weary about the excesses such industries may bring, EU tech czar Margrethe Vestager aims to ensure technology deployed in Europe is transparent and has human oversight, likely meaning more stringent guidelines than in many other regions."

In a surprise announcement Monday before markets opened in New York, the U.S. central bank said it will buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to keep borrowing costs at rock-bottom levels -- and to help ensure chaotic markets function properly. It also set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations as well as state and local governments.
The Fed’s latest steps landed as investors wait for U.S. lawmakers to deliver a multi-trillion dollar package of coronavirus support, which failed to come together Sunday when Democrats objected that it did not do enough for average Americans.
Following a string of emergency measures last week, the moves also increasingly push the central bank into new territory by providing direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.
“Wow, just wow,” George Rusnak, head of investment management at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television. “Hopefully you’ll come out of this with some fiscal stimulus as well, and you’ll be set with good growth opportunities in the long run.”
In a sign, however, of just how unnerved investors are by the pandemic, the Fed’s moves failed to spark anything beyond a brief rally in stocks and corporate bonds Monday after weeks of staggering losses.
Stocks fell 4.5% in New York. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries initially sank below 0.69% as investors digested the news before pushing back to around 0.74%.
Some pockets of the market reacted positively to the Fed moves. Signs of stress in the corporate debt sector eased, with the CDX Investment Grade index spread tightening. Bond ETFs eligible for central-bank purchases rallied and the dollar retreated versus major peers.
Economic Shutdown
Monday’s Fed action followed an already-dizzying number of steps taken by Chairman Jerome Powell in the past three weeks that would have been unthinkable just months ago. They represent a dramatic reaction to the sudden stop inflicted on the economy by the contagion and by the subsequent panic among investors.
Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs separately joined an emergency call to work on a joint response to the economic blow dealt by the pandemic.
The U.S. economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30% in the second quarter, along with a 50% drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30% in the second quarter.
The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.
Not a ‘Slush Fund’
“This is not a slush-fund,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business earlier on Monday. “It’s a mechanism we can use working with the Federal Reserve to provide another $4 trillion of liquidity into the market. That’s on top of the Fed’s balance sheet. This is a massive liquidity program.”
Beyond the unlimited quantitative easing program, the new emergency facilities will employ a total of $300 billion, backed by $30 billion from the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund.
Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, said he expects those facilities to grow substantially if Congress moves ahead with plans to pump more money into the ESF.
The draft of an economic aid bill currently being hashed out on Capitol Hill included $425 billion for the ESF to support Fed actions.
The Fed’s new credit facilities carry limits on paying dividends and making stock buybacks for firms that defer interest payments, but have no explicit restrictions preventing beneficiaries from laying off workers.
The Fed said a week ago it would buy at least $500 billion of Treasuries and $200 billion of agency MBS. The Fed will now make those purchases unlimited and will take on a slew of new efforts, many aimed at directly aiding employers and households, as well as cities and states.
“This is a great step forward,” said Julia Coronado the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. “Getting to the corporate bond market was critical. A lot of people needed to be clear the QE was unconstrained.”
Other Highlights
• Two more programs were created to support large employers -- a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility for new bond and loan issuance, and a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds.
• Yet another program, a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, will “enable the issuance of asset-backed securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration and certain other assets.”
• The central bank also said it would expand the existing Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to include a wider range of securities, including municipal variable-rate demand notes
• Finally, the Fed said it would expand the existing Commercial Paper Funding Facility to also include high-quality municipal debt, another move to help cash-strapped states and cities.
“The Fed’s latest moves signal a resounding ‘whatever it takes’ approach from the central bank, and dispel any notion that monetary policy makers are either sparing ammunition or running out of unconventional tools,” Andrew Husby and Carl Riccadonna, of Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a note to clients."

In a surprise announcement Monday before markets opened in New York, the U.S. central bank said it will buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to keep borrowing costs at rock-bottom levels -- and to help ensure chaotic markets function properly. It also set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations as well as state and local governments.
The Fed’s latest steps landed as investors wait for U.S. lawmakers to deliver a multi-trillion dollar package of coronavirus support, which failed to come together Sunday when Democrats objected that it did not do enough for average Americans.
Following a string of emergency measures last week, the moves also increasingly push the central bank into new territory by providing direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.
“Wow, just wow,” George Rusnak, head of investment management at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television. “Hopefully you’ll come out of this with some fiscal stimulus as well, and you’ll be set with good growth opportunities in the long run.”
In a sign, however, of just how unnerved investors are by the pandemic, the Fed’s moves failed to spark anything beyond a brief rally in stocks and corporate bonds Monday after weeks of staggering losses.
Stocks fell 4.5% in New York. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries initially sank below 0.69% as investors digested the news before pushing back to around 0.74%.
Some pockets of the market reacted positively to the Fed moves. Signs of stress in the corporate debt sector eased, with the CDX Investment Grade index spread tightening. Bond ETFs eligible for central-bank purchases rallied and the dollar retreated versus major peers.
Economic Shutdown
Monday’s Fed action followed an already-dizzying number of steps taken by Chairman Jerome Powell in the past three weeks that would have been unthinkable just months ago. They represent a dramatic reaction to the sudden stop inflicted on the economy by the contagion and by the subsequent panic among investors.
Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs separately joined an emergency call to work on a joint response to the economic blow dealt by the pandemic.
The U.S. economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30% in the second quarter, along with a 50% drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30% in the second quarter.
The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.

Day by day, tweet by tweet, unhinged briefing by unhinged briefing, President Trump is making it worse. That is a hard conclusion to reach, even for someone like me who has long considered Trump one of the worst presidents in our history.
The covid-19 pandemic is the definition of a moment when everyone should hope and pray for strong, smart, steady presidential leadership. Indeed, the restrictions Trump imposed against travel from China and Europe, where the novel coronavirus was running rampant — whether his motives were scientific or xenophobic — had a good impact. He bought us some time. But then he squandered it.
If you can bear to watch Trump’s performances during the daily White House update briefings, you can only conclude that any effective federal response is happening not because of the commander in chief, but despite him.
The essential problem, of course, is the president’s unshakable view that everything is always, always about him. As Alice Roosevelt Longworth once said about her father, President Theodore Roosevelt, Trump insists on being “the corpse at every funeral, the bride at every wedding and the baby at every christening.” This is a moment for selflessness, but Trump has shown no capacity to think of anything other than himself.
We are asked to stay home and avoid one another, at great economic and psychological cost, to keep the covid-19 pandemic from overwhelming the nation’s health system. The crisis calls for shared sacrifice. Yet at Sunday’s briefing, Trump went on and on about why he will not make the commitment to sacrifice any potential bailout funds for which his hotel properties might qualify.
“You know, every time I do it, like, for instance, I committed publicly that I wouldn’t take the $450,000 salary [as president],” he said. “It’s a lot of money. Whether you’re rich or not, it’s a lot of money. And I did it. Nobody cared. Nobody — nobody said thank you. Nobody said thank you very much.”
There are others who deserve that “thank you very much” and more: the front-line health-care workers who are dangerously reusing protective masks and gowns because such vital gear remains in desperately short supply; the millions of workers in the restaurant and hotel industries who have lost their jobs and in many cases have no savings or benefits to tide them over; the millions of retirees who have seen their 401(k) balances evaporate; the millions of parents who are trying to work their office jobs from their kitchen tables while home-schooling their children while keeping tabs on their elderly relatives who are most vulnerable to the virus.
It is not too much to expect a president to show his gratitude for the sacrifices his citizens are making by doing everything he can to support them, rather than whine that the nation is not thanking him. Yet who believes, at this point, that we will ever see such moral leadership from Trump?
Since that’s not coming, I’d settle for practical leadership. But we aren’t getting that from Trump, either. He could have compelled the production of protective medical gear and lifesaving ventilators. He could have ordered the military to distribute these supplies. He could have spelled out a national “social distancing” policy rather than allow a patchwork of different rules in different jurisdictions.
And he could have called in the leaders of both the House and the Senate and insisted that they work together to quickly pass the massive trillion-dollar bailout package that is sorely needed to keep what is left of the economy afloat. Instead, Trump refuses to talk to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and busies himself retweeting political attacks against likely Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
We are basically on our own. And, all things considered, across much of the country, we’re doing pretty well given the circumstances.
Governors, notably Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, have stepped up to exercise the kind of political leadership we need and provide calming day-to-day narration of the crisis. Medical experts — led by the ubiquitous and irreplaceable Anthony S. Fauci, whom I’d like to encase in bubble wrap to protect his health — politely correct Trump’s pseudoscience with real science. In my immediate community, few people are ignoring the social-distancing mandates. Congress is grinding its way, messily, toward a relief package.
“I want America to understand, this week, it’s going to get bad,” Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams said on Monday. Trump has the power and the platform to make us confident that things will eventually get better, but he either can’t or won’t. We must continue to comfort and reassure ourselves."
"March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/state-department-says-13500-americans-stranded-abroad-have-asked-for-help/2020/03/23/94dc05a6-6d2f-11ea-96a0-df4c5d9284af_story.html,The Washington Post,"State Department says 13,500 Americans stranded abroad have asked for help","The State Department is preparing to evacuate thousands of Americans stranded overseas, with 16 flights scheduled in the next five days and more to follow, officials said Monday.
The officials also said that about 30 State Department employees posted in embassies and consulates abroad have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Small numbers of employees in six U.S. locations — Washington, Houston, Boston, New York, Seattle and Quantico, Va. — have also tested positive.
A task force assembled by the State Department is working on getting flights out for the 13,500 Americans who have reached out asking for help, officials said.
“Consider whether you are ready to ride out an undetermined period of time where you are now, or do you want to go to the United States to wait out events,” a senior State Department official said of the advice he is telling diplomats to advise Americans. “If it’s the latter, do so now, and that last bit is all caps.”
The effort to repatriate Americans has become the main focus of the State Department as it has suspended all routine visa operations and reassigned personnel to the often-complex task of getting people out of countries as borders and airports close.
Many Americans in countries that have imposed travel restrictions have complained that the diplomatic missions have not been reachable or provided inadequate assistance.
Roughly 10 million Americans are expatriates who reside in foreign countries and an unknown number are tourists or abroad on business trips. The State Department already has evacuated 5,000 Americans starting with about 800 flown out Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.
A second official said the State Department expects to evacuate at least 1,600 more Americans over the next five days.
“We prioritize people, taking account of their vulnerability,” the official said. “If somebody is 70 years old and has an underlying condition such as diabetes or heart disease, that person has priority over a hale and hearty 20-year-old.”
The State Department has adopted new policies for voluntary, authorized departures, so some diplomats and civil servants have returned to the United States. They have been assigned to help evacuate Americans. Other employees have also been enlisted, including some who normally work on economics, diplomatic security, public affairs and legislative affairs.
The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under State Department rules for briefing reporters, said the window is rapidly closing for commercial flights. In some places, civilians have been flown out on U.S. military flights when space was available. The State Department is working with the Defense Department to see if more flights and spaces can be arranged.
Officials also are working with foreign governments to arrange evacuations on private chartered flights. Flights taking undocumented immigrants back to their countries also are returning to the United States with American civilians.
“We’re hearing from people in very remote parts of the world,” the first official said. “It’s complicated.”
In Peru, for example, diplomats are trying to move Americans out of areas reachable only by airplane, at a time when the Peruvians have shut down internal air travel. International flights are limited because the civilian side of the Lima airport has been closed, and the military part of the facility has less capacity.
“I hesitate to guarantee we can move every person,” the official said. “But we will move very large numbers.”"

With the public barred from the court because of concerns over the novel coronavirus, the justices stayed away, as well. For apparently the first time since handing down its December 2000 opinion in Bush v. Gore, the justices did not take the bench to issue rulings in cases argued earlier in the term.
Instead, opinions were published online in five-minute intervals.
The justices have indefinitely postponed oral arguments in a round of cases that was supposed to begin Monday. On Friday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was alone at the justices’ private conference table while the rest participated by teleconference, the court’s public information office said.
Still to be determined is when or whether oral arguments will be scheduled in the remainder of accepted cases, including President Trump’s challenges to subpoenas from congressional committees and a prosecutor for copies of his financial records. Oral arguments are a tradition but not a requirement
The court did not grant any new cases for next term on Monday, and its decisions came in cases that were argued in the fall.
The court ruled 6 to 3 that Kansas is not constitutionally required to compel the acquittal of a defendant because mental illness prevents him from telling right from wrong.
Justice Elena Kagan departed from her usual liberal colleagues and joined conservatives in upholding the Kansas law, and Roberts assigned her the court’s majority opinion.
“Defining the precise relationship between criminal culpability and mental illness involves examining the workings of the brain, the purposes of the criminal law, the ideas of free will and responsibility,” Kagan wrote, and should be “open to revision” as new medical knowledge emerges and legal and moral norms evolve.
“Which is all to say that it is a project for state governance, not constitutional law,” she concluded.
Most states allow a defendant to avoid conviction if he can prove he lacked the required intent to commit a crime, and also if he can show mental illness prevented him from seeing the act was morally wrong. Kansas eliminated the second option, although a convicted defendant can make such a showing at sentencing to avoid a tough sentence or even be admitted to a mental institution instead of imprisoned or put to death.
“Kansas’s scheme does not abolish the insanity defense,” Kagan wrote, and therefore the court’s dissenters are wrong “to suggest that Kansas’s law has become untethered from moral judgments about culpability.”
The decision came in what Kagan called a “terrible crime.” James Kraig Kahler killed four family members, including his estranged wife and two teenage daughters, in 2009. His lawyers said severe depression over the breakup of his marriage rendered him incapable of forming the intent necessary to convict him of capital murder.
But Kansas did not allow such a defense, and the state also pointed out Kahler was aware enough to spare his son, who he thought had not sided with his mother in the divorce. Kahler was convicted and sentenced to death.
Along with Roberts, Kagan was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. Kansas, Breyer wrote, “eliminated the core of a defense that has existed for centuries: that the defendant, due to mental illness , lacked the mental capacity necessary for his conduct to be considered morally blameworthy.”
Breyer offered a hypothetical involving two people: a mentally ill defendant who killed a person because he believed the victim was a dog, and one who killed someone because he believed a dog told him to do it.
“Now ask, what moral difference exists between the defendants in the two examples?” Breyer wrote. “Assuming equivalently convincing evidence of mental illness, I can find none at all.”
The case is Kahler v. Kansas.
In the Comcast case, the court said comedian Byron Allen must allege that his entertainment company would have received a contract if not for racial bias on the part of the media company.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had agreed with Allen that the suit by his Entertainment Studios Network could move forward just on credible allegations that race was an issue in Comcast’s decision-making, at least in filing the complaint.
Allen filed his $20 billion lawsuit against Comcast after years of unsuccessful negotiations to carry the channels of his company. Comcast has said it based its decision on “insufficient consumer demand” for the network’s programs, but Allen contends that Comcast has constantly shifted its reasoning and made comments that he interpreted as involving his race.
Allen sued under Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which says “all individuals within the United States shall have the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by its white citizens.”
Gorsuch, writing for the court, said Allen needed to show that race was the reason for the Comcast decision, as is the case in other kinds of discrimination cases. To read the law otherwise would “require more than a little judicial adventurism, and look a good deal more like amending a law than interpreting one.”
The court sent the case back to the lower court, without an indication of whether Allen would be able to make such a showing.
Allen and civil rights groups said the court was making it harder to press discrimination claims. The court “has rendered a ruling that is harmful to the civil rights of millions of Americans,” Allen said in a statement.
Comcast countered: “The nation’s civil rights laws have not changed with this ruling; they remain the same as before the case was filed. We now hope that on remand the 9th Circuit will agree that the district court properly applied that standard in dismissing Mr. Allen’s case three separate times.”
The case is Comcast Corp. v. National Association of African American-Owned Media.
In Allen v. Cooper, the court ruled against filmmaker Frederick Allen, who wanted to sue North Carolina for use of his copyrighted videos of the submerged shipwreck of the pirate Blackbeard’s Queen Anne’s Revenge.
But all members of the court agreed with the bottom line in Kagan’s opinion that the state was protected by sovereign immunity and could not be sued for copyright infringement."

Few events are more emblematic of its perceived retreat than the company’s decision to go private.
Once feted as the ultimate middleman between the consumer markets of the West and the supply chains of Asia, the Hong Kong-based company enjoyed its heyday during the years after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, when the country’s exports boomed. Those glory days are long gone. On Friday, the founding Fung family and GLP Pte of Singapore offered HK$1.25 per share in cash to take the company private.
In immediate terms, the HK$7.22 billion ($930 million) offer is attractive, representing a 150% premium to the stock’s closing price before the bid was made public. Long-term shareholders who kept faith in the company’s plans to restructure, digitize its operations and diversify sourcing away from China are unlikely to be impressed. Li & Fung shares had fallen 98% from their 2011 high as of Friday’s close. The offer premium pares that loss to 94%.
As the world’s biggest supplier of consumer goods, Li & Fung designs, sources and transports products from Asia to retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Nike Inc. There are many factors behind its long decline, from rising factory wages in China to the “retail apocalypse” hollowing out American main streets. The U.S.-China trade war dealt another grievous blow to a business model that depended on linking factories in Asia with American retailers. The coronavirus, which shut down swathes of China’s economy and threatens to drive the world into recession, may have been the final straw.
The biggest driver of Li & Fung’s downfall, though, may be the rise of e-commerce and, specifically, of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Jack Ma’s internet behemoth connected Chinese producers with overseas buyers directly, finally obviating the need for a comprador-type service to negotiate the pitfalls on behalf of foreign companies. At the same time, the tightening grip of e-commerce retailers in the U.S., principally Amazon.com Inc., has undermined the bricks-and-mortars retailers such as Macy’s Inc. and Kohl’s Corp. on which Li & Fung relied.
Chief Executive Officer Spencer Fung, whose great-grandfather founded the company more than a century ago, and GLP, a logistics firm that was taken private in 2018  in a private equity-backed management buyout, will now seek a revival away from the glare of the public markets. It’s not the first time Li & Fung has gone private, having withdrawn in the 1980s before listing again in 1992, as Vinicy Chan and Daniela Wei of Bloomberg News wrote Monday.
Repeating the trick will be more difficult this time. Unlike the privatization of another storied Hong Kong business, the real estate company Wheelock & Co., this isn’t a purchase of undervalued tangible assets that can (arguably) be expected to revive with a turn in the market cycle. Li & Fung has long prided itself on its “asset light” model. As a result, the company has typically traded at high multiples of its book value — averaging 7.3 times in the decade through 2010. Even in its present depressed state, Li & Fung is being taken private at a premium to book.
Li & Fung’s value lies in intangibles such as its network of relationships with factories and buyers. What are these worth now, after the whole model has been upended? The company has pushed into the higher-margin logistics business. This, though, made up only 10% of revenue last year, insignificant beside the 77% that sourcing contributed. 
The fundamental trouble for Li & Fung is that the world appears to have changed irrevocably. If the company does return to public markets one day, it’s likely to be in a radically different form."

In an effort to curtail the fast-spreading novel coronavirus, they were told, D.C. officials had imposed new social distancing restrictions that capped the number of people who could attend at 50, a figure that included church and funeral home staffers.
Donovan’s three sons — in the midst of grieving — suddenly were faced with deciding which mourners had been closest to their mother and should be welcomed inside Friday’s service, and how to gently turn others away.
“My mom touched so many lives. She was well loved,” said Donovan’s son Thomas Randolph, 48, of Washington. “It was disturbing. I wondered how this was going to go. I mean, 50 people? That’s almost the total number of people in my family by itself.”
The pandemic has stripped away many of the comforting aspects of funerals. No hugging or handshakes. Grieving relatives and friends are forced to sit in pews by themselves or with only one other person. Repasts where mourners gather to share a meal have been canceled.
Government leaders in the District, Maryland and Virginia have tightened restrictions on gatherings over time as concerns about the virus have increased, meaning a changing set of rules. At 10 p.m. Wednesday, the District began limiting funerals to 10 people. Officials in Maryland and Virginia had already reduced funeral attendance to 10.
The restrictions have prompted some families to look to alternative ways to celebrate a loved one’s life. Some are turning to technology such as live-streaming or Web applications; others are holding private funerals with plans to have a public service weeks — or months — down the road.
Within this new and changing dynamic, religious leaders and funeral directors are scrambling to implement precautions that will keep mourners safe, while still reflecting religious customs and rituals and providing solace for families.
Marche S. Morris, chief executive of Morris Funerals and Cremation Services, worked with one family who had a service for a loved one last week at Ebenezer AME Church in Fort Washington, Md. More than 200 people attended.
They decided to forgo the traditional guest book, which tended to attract a line of people. Morris’s employees spritzed sanitizer into the hands of each person who walked into the sanctuary. And after walking past the casket, guests were quickly ushered to pews by white-glove-wearing ushers, no hugs allowed.
“We know you want to be close together. For me, not able to hold you and hug you, it’s hard. But we don’t have a choice right now. But we do have a choice in Jesus, and He will get us through this,” the Rev. Barbara Riley told the mourners.
After the service, Ebenezer’s cleaning crew, armed with disinfectant, descended on the sanctuary.
After the Fort Washington funeral, Morris received notification from Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) detailing how funeral directors in the state should use “reasonable efforts” to keep such gatherings at 50 people or fewer.
In a March 16 order forbidding any gathering of 50 or more people in Maryland, Hogan wrote that a business owner would face a fine of $5,000 or a year in jail. A day later, Hogan’s office said that the order did not “prohibit” funerals but that funeral directors should undertake “reasonable efforts” to meet the limit. Now, that limit has decreased to 10 people.
“The attendance number seems to be changing daily,” Morris said. “I have to explain to every family and show them the executive order if I have to.”
Morris received information about the District’s 50-person restriction a day before the Donovan homegoing service. So she had to quickly devise a plan to accommodate as many people as possible.
On the morning of the service, about 40 members of Donovan’s family were ushered two by two through the front door of Delaware Baptist Church for the wake. Morris then directed the relatives out of the sanctuary to a waiting area.
Morris’s staff explained the regulations to other mourners waiting outside and allowed them to enter in small groups, view the body and acknowledge — but not hug or touch — Donovan’s sons, who were standing by the casket. When one group exited through the church’s side door, another was brought in.
As the time for her mother-in-law’s service neared, Randolph’s wife, Natarsha, stood in front of the church doors in a slight rain and apologized to the 100 or so people gathered. Standing with a list of people her husband and his brothers had identified, she called the names of those who could come inside. They were the people the family decided were closest to Donovan, who had died of cancer at age 79.
“It was very hard to choose,” she said. “I tried to count, but there were people standing everywhere, even across the street because no one could stand close together. I just asked most of the younger guys if they didn’t mind staying out during the service. We shortened the service so it wouldn’t be long.”
Some families and funeral directors have utilized technology to circumvent the challenge of assembling at a funeral during a pandemic.
When Linda Rochkind Katz died last week, following 18 months of steadily declining health, her three adult children feared feeling isolated at a tiny funeral, with just a trio of chairs.
This was not the kind of service befitting their mother, who was 75 when she died. Katz was a teacher who held a doctorate in Spanish literature, worked as a docent at the Smithsonian’s American Art Museum, served as a Potomac, Md.-area PTA leader and was a bar-bat mitzvah tutor.
“I thought it was incredibly depressing that there wouldn’t be anyone there to hug us or to honor my mom in the way they would want to and in the way she deserved,” said her daughter Karen Katz, 45, of New York.
As the Katz siblings considered what to do, a cousin suggested a way for family and friends across the globe to attend the funeral and later the at-home mourning service: by broadcasting them virtually through the online ­conference-meeting application Zoom.
Within hours, they had spoken to their longtime family rabbi, Bruce Kahn, and other staffers at Temple Shalom in Chevy Chase, Md.
But they had to move fast, since Jewish tradition calls for immediate burial — ideally within 24 hours. Judaism teaches that this helps mourners face the death and lets the soul of the departed fully move from its earthly, bodily state.
“We immediately all felt a lot better and realized it could be a lot better than we thought. It wasn’t a lonely thing at all,” Karen Katz said.
The rabbis from Temple Shalom created a link for the Katzes and family and friends.
Karen, Ken and Mark Katz, holding their cellphones, stood alone at the graveside watching Kahn telephonically officiate from his Chevy Chase home while 150 family members and friends tuned in online.
“We felt that. The picture makes us look sad and alone, and it didn’t feel that way at all,” Karen Katz said. “Knowing so many people were going to be with us felt pretty tremendous.”
Kelsi Graham, though, is still awaiting that feeling of providing a fitting goodbye for a loved one. Last week, in the small town of Oakland, Md., about four hours northwest of the District, Graham and her family were faced with deciding who could attend the funeral of her 74-year-old grandmother, who died of a severe type of diabetes. So Graham made a decision. The 27-year-old gave her slot to one of her grandmother’s friends.
Patricia “Patty” Graham had attended a church with about 100 members and had planned a large funeral for herself.
“None of those people got to come,” Kelsi Graham said.
The family now plans to hold a memorial service where all of her family and friends can pay tribute in the months ahead.
“Later on, once this all gets cleared up, we’re going to have a celebration of life for everyone who did not get to attend,” Graham said. “We still plan to honor her the way she wanted and the way she deserved.”"
"March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/dialysis-patients-are-at-high-risk-during-covid-19-outbreak/2020/03/24/6e69f908-6aa7-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html,The Washington Post,Dialysis patients are at high risk during covid-19 outbreak,"Care for the nation’s 500,000 kidney dialysis patients, who routinely undergo treatment while packed together in group settings, is posing an especially difficult problem for physicians and experts planning for the anticipated surge of coronavirus cases.
Patients with severe kidney disease, already vulnerable because of their life-threatening illness, are worried that receiving dialysis in large facilities with dozens of other people could expose them to infection.
Doctors fear that if the covid-19 disease spreads in treatment centers, patients seeking dialysis will flood overburdened and under-equipped hospital emergency departments.
Some of the nation’s more than 5,000 private dialysis centers have begun handing out masks to stem the spread of the virus, but others are running short and rationing them.
Health-care providers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the two companies that dominate private dialysis are developing ways to separate the well from the infected in dialysis centers. All expect that doing so will be necessary in coming weeks.
The plight of dialysis patients illustrates the larger difficulty of delivering medical care to huge numbers of people in a pandemic, when the single most important tactic is keeping them apart.
“Because patients need dialysis to live, self-quarantine at home is not an option,” said Nicole Lurie, a top preparedness official in the Obama administration and current co-chair of the emergency preparedness committee of the American Society of Nephrology. “Sending infected patients to the hospital only overwhelms the system even more, and introduces another source of infection. So the challenge of keeping staff from becoming infected and unable to work, and protecting non-infected patients from infected ones is huge.”
With their kidneys ineffective, most dialysis patients endure a difficult regimen of having their blood cleansed three days a week, four hours at a time. This is done mainly in privately-operated dialysis centers where eight to more than 30 chairs are arrayed in a large room. The patients’ blood runs through filters that remove toxins and waste before a machine circulates the blood back into them.
Most centers are operated by one of two companies, Fresenius Kidney Care and DaVita Kidney Care. A small percentage of patients receive their care at home, from centers affiliated with hospitals or from other organizations.
The nature of their kidney disease makes dialysis patients highly vulnerable to complications of infection and other health threats. Even a single missed session can cause life-threatening buildup of fluid in their lungs and hearts.
They “are older and by and large they have co-morbidities like diabetes and chronic heart disease and chronic lung disease,” said Alan Kliger, a nephrologist who is co-leading a task force that is trying to work out preparations for dialysis patients. “They are the primary at-risk group for covid-19.”
At Patty Danielson’s Fresenius dialysis clinic in Portland, Ore., about 25 chairs are grouped in “pods” of four about three or four feet apart — less than the minimum six feet recommended for effective social distancing during the pandemic. There is one enclosed chair for patients with infectious diseases who need to be isolated from the rest, she said.
Danielson, 61, who has been on dialysis for more than 12 years, leaves work as a psychiatric nurse manager precisely at 4 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays so she can be in the chair at 4:45 and out by 9:15. Since the outbreak, staff members at the dialysis center have begun distributing surgical masks to each patient to prevent droplet transmission and are taking temperatures at the door. Patients with fevers above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit are not allowed in.
With her immune system already compromised, “it was quite a sobering moment to think that if I get this virus I could die,” Danielson said. “It made me think about getting my funeral planned.” Which she did.
Planners are working on a variety of approaches, none of them ideal, for the time when the virus invades dialysis centers. Shannon Novosad, acting team lead for the CDC’s dialysis safety team, said that to accommodate patients infected with covid-19, centers may have to fill fewer seats to enforce six feet of distance between people receiving treatment. All may need masks to prevent infecting other patients.
Another possibility is to send all infected patients to one center or group them in one four-hour “shift” where they can’t harm one another, Kliger said.
But many dialysis patients depend on ride services or ambulettes to get to their facilities, and experts worry that drivers will not want to transport patients they know are infected, especially groups of them. In vans, infected patients may be sitting with uninfected people. Patients with jobs may have difficulty changing their shifts abruptly.
Already, some infected patients have been admitted to hospitals and must get their care there, Novosad said. “In some regions, capacity and hospital beds will definitely become an issue,” she said.
Dialysis centers also are suffering the same equipment shortages as other health-care facilities in places such as New York City, which has become the center of the U.S. outbreak.
Jeffrey Silberzweig, who runs eight nonprofit dialysis centers for the hospital-based Rogosin Institute, said he is stretching his mask supply beyond its limit. Each staff member is being asked to use a mask until it becomes too moist or tears.
“Our goal is make a mask last a week,” he said. “In some cases that will happen, but in many cases it won’t.”
Silberzweig doesn’t know when new supplies will arrive. “We reached out to the New York City Department of Health seeking more masks and we were told we are not a priority for the limited supply they have available,” he said.
Spokesmen for Fresenius and DaVita declined to answer questions about their efforts. In a prepared statement, DaVita said: “We are working in lockstep with the CDC and the kidney care community to protect our patient population and caregivers. Our proven expertise and international experience, coupled with our national footprint, allows us to roll out protocols quickly to avoid delicate and costly hospitalizations.”
In written answers to questions, Robert Kossmann, chief medical officer for Fresenius Medical Care North America, said the company has referred positive covid-19 cases to local health departments and hospitals where they can be treated and receive dialysis.
Kossmann said the company is trying to identify shifts and whole facilities where dialysis patients with covid-19 can be separated from uninfected patients. The company’s supply chain for protective equipment has not been disrupted, he said."

The proposal would provide Mnuchin with funds to pay for services related to $500 billion in lending programs for small businesses, states and municipalities. Recipients could include brokers, dealers and banks serving as financial agents for the government, according to a draft copy of the bill.
The legislation would allow the institutions to “perform all reasonable duties the Secretary determines necessary to respond to the coronavirus,” according to a draft.
The provision is laid out in the part of the legislation that is being heavily debated in the Senate: $500 billion in loans and loan guarantees aimed at mitigating the virus’ damage to the U.S. economy.
Of that, $425 billion is for businesses, cities and states, while $50 billion is for passenger airlines, $17 billion for firms deemed important to national security and $8 billion for cargo airlines.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi early Tuesday said that it appears the Senate has agreed to accept language in a House version of the bill that would create both an independent inspector general and a congressionally appointed five-person panel to supervise money the bill provides to companies.
Two people familiar with the matter said the administration had agreed to oversight of the fund for companies, but said details were not yet resolved.
Mnuchin is also courting executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other Wall Street firms to help oversee the bailout packages, Bloomberg News reported Friday.
Treasury is considering executives with broad experience to help administer loans to airlines, hotels and other industries suffering as the virus shuts down parts of the economy, the people said. The government is also considering taking equity stakes in some companies in exchange for aid, a program that financiers and bankers could administer.
The Federal Reserve could also detail some of its staff to the Treasury Department, as it did during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.
During that crisis, Treasury Secretaries Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner brought in additional staff, including prominent Wall Street figures, to help manage the bailouts of U.S. banks and auto companies."
"March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/03/24/senators-urge-trump-administration-protect-student-data-rush-online-schooling/,The Washington Post,Senators urge Trump administration to protect student data in rush to online schooling,"With tens of millions of American students now learning online after their schools closed amid the global coronavirus pandemic, some U.S. senators are urging the Trump administration to take steps to protect personal student data.
“The recent dramatic increase in American children’s use of ed tech offerings creates opportunities, and also carries with it serious privacy challenges and risks to children’s wellbeing,” says the letter from three Democratic senators: Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.
The letter was written to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joseph Simons and FTC Commissioners Noah Phillips, Rohit Chopra, Rebecca Slaughter and Christine Wilson. The FTC is the federal agency responsible for enforcement of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and the Education Department is responsible for enforcing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
The senators noted that online education can help students keep learning while they are staying home for an undetermined amount of time.
“However, many ed tech offerings collect large amounts of data about students and do not employ adequate privacy or security measures,” they wrote. “Experts have found ‘widespread lack of transparency and inconsistent privacy and security practices in the industry for educational software and other applications used in schools and by children outside the classroom for learning.’ And the Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned that ‘[m]alicious use of [student] data could result in social engineering, bullying, tracking, identity theft, or other means for targeting children.’”"

I don’t think I could survive worse.,"KANSAS CITY — I am thankful for my mild to moderate symptoms.
Are they covid-19 symptoms? I certainly think so. I’ve been reading descriptions of other cases, mild to moderate — that’s what the authorities say most of us have in store — and those portraits of the novel disease involve endless fevers, shocking weakness, full-body aches, utter exhaustion, stomach distress, constant dehydration. That picture makes a pretty good match with my miserable little case.
Of course, I don’t know for sure that I have covid-19, because there is no testing where I live. People talk about testing on TV all day long. Usually, I’m listening through a scrim of fitful sleep. It’s like being stuck in the Loch Ness Monster programming on basic cable. There is no Nessie and no testing, but the talk goes on and on and on.
The closest I came to being tested was on Saturday. After my wife spent an entire day on the phone, a nice doctor met me in an emergency room parking lot and taught me to put on a mask. Then she had me stand by the car while she listened to my lungs. She smiled under her mask and said, “Given your symptoms, we’ll assume that you have it. Come back if you get worse.”
I don’t want to come back, even if I might get a test.
My mild to moderate symptoms are plenty for me.
How was I exposed? I did not travel during the outbreak. I don’t mix in large groups. (On second thought, there was a college basketball game.) I earn my living by solitary work from my own home, and I adopted every recommended hygiene and distancing technique weeks before the president took the pandemic seriously. Bottom line: I don’t know where I picked it up. It’s everywhere.
The first symptom was fever. I figured I had the flu. No such luck. The mild to moderate symptoms of this coronavirus make garden-variety flu seem like a tea party. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) described the relentless, soul-sapping fever as being hit by “a ton of bricks.” It’s funny: Thirty years ago, Mario was a hotshot young politician and I was a hotshot young reporter in Miami. I don’t think either one of us spent much time thinking about malaise. Now we are a couple of aging gentlemen flattened by a ton of bricks.
My image is more particular. Seven days into the waves of fever, I was drifting half in and half out of sleep. I was wearing a down jacket with the hood cinched around my head. I was buried under the covers, teeth chattering. A week like that is a very long time. (Nine days, and counting, is still longer.)
In my weird dream, I was on the high-winter prairie. I was on horseback. The ground was black mud, and where the animals stepped, the impressions of their shoes froze almost immediately. Meanwhile, a hard, freezing rain was falling, filling the ruts with ice water. I fell from the horse into the mud. The horse kept walking over me. I couldn’t stand up.
Those are my mild to moderate symptoms. And I’m thankful for them. Because I don’t have certain other symptoms — not yet. My headaches have been few. For many covid-19 sufferers, the headaches are excruciating. My lungs are working well, which means I don’t have to enter the hospital.
It’s going to be a race now to see whether I can finish this column before I pass out. Writing even this much has been the most taxing thing I’ve done in a week, since I finished my last column in a delirium.
What I want to convey is that the virus we’ve been bracing for is now here. We jawboned about it for a month while it grew by 100,000 cases — mine included. Now the disease is racing at close to 10,000 cases per day. Those of us on the frontier with our mild to moderate symptoms want to tell you this is nothing to trifle with. This is no time to step off the gas.
That most of us will survive this nasty, grueling, humiliating disease is no reason to imagine that fighting it might be costlier than giving in to it. The idea that we’re on the brink of a return to normalcy is flatly insane. We’re barely saying hello to covid-19 in its mild and moderate mercies. That phrase itself reflects the blithe taxonomy of pandemic triage — whatever doesn’t kill you must be mild or moderate. It only makes sense in the context of a far deadlier version of the virus that, if allowed to run wild, will shatter public confidence in our leaders for years to come.
I am thankful for my mild to moderate symptoms. I’m not sure I could survive anything worse."

The department is also asking educators to teach students in every grade the material they were supposed to learn through the end of the year, James F. Lane, the state superintendent of public instruction, wrote in a memo to school officials, although he recommended against giving grades. Lane suggested a variety of ways to accomplish this, including online instruction, holding class over the summer and extending the 2020-2021 school year to cover the missed material.
Lane sent the memo hours after Gov. Ralph Northam (D) ordered schools shuttered for the school year to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. He said his department would be as flexible “as is prudent and allowable” under Virginia law as it works to ensure seniors’ graduation.
“The governor and I agree that every student who was on a trajectory toward earning a diploma should be able to graduate on time and move on to the next stage of his or her life,” Lane said in a statement. “I hope the flexibility that I am announcing today will help students and teachers as they cope with the deep disappointment of having their time together unexpectedly cut short.”
Lane said the department is waiving some graduation requirements to ensure that several cohorts of seniors graduate on time no matter what — including students who have not completed all of the previously required courses, students who have not passed formerly mandatory state testing, and students who lack certain career and technical education credentials. He said the power to waive other requirements, such as training in CPR, lies with the General Assembly.
The Education Department last week asked federal officials to waive standardized testing requirements for students throughout the state.
“I am confident that everyone recognizes that students should not be prevented from graduating because of unforeseen circumstances beyond their control,” Lane said.
Northam announced the closures Monday, launching the state into an unprecedented era of education fraught with challenges. One of the most pressing is how educators can reach students virtually, given the fact that many families lack access to computers or the Internet.
This is partly why schools should refrain from grading over the next few months, Lane wrote in his guidance. In lieu of traditional grades, he suggested that school officials consider offering classes “pass/fail,” or calculating grades based on previously completed work.
Lane repeatedly emphasized that any plans for online learning should make accommodations for families with fewer resources.
“The provision of instruction should be done with careful consideration of providing equitable access and support for a variety of students,” Lane wrote — one of six times the word “equitable” appeared in the six-page guidelines.
He did not specify further."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to give up his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president and return to Congress to craft legislation placing “the needs of workers ahead of those corporate profiteers.”
We can’t partition the economic health of employees from that of their employers. Moreover, Mr. Scarborough should temper his virulent anti-corporate rhetoric. He whipped up contempt for Fortune 500 companies “piecing together corporate bailouts” that “already received massive financial windfalls from Trump’s tax cuts.” But those 2017 tax cuts were a bipartisan goal previously endorsed by the Obama administration because this nation’s high tax rates were not competitive internationally. One could debate the magnitude but not the basic need for significant cuts.
Mr. Scarborough assailed corporations for buying back stock instead of expanding their operations, giving workers raises, etc. It is worth considering that “workers” in the United States’ largest corporations already tend to be well-paid and that, for manufacturers, President Trump’s initiation of a trade war on the heels of  the tax cuts triggered fears of a global recession that threw cold water on potential domestic expansion projects.
The op-ed portrayed these “largest corporations” as “back at the trough lobbying for another bailout.” Presumably, this is an allusion to the controversial bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis. However, the recipients in that era were big banks, a major insurance company and auto manufacturers. These are not the businesses imperiled by the coronavirus crisis and seeking federal assistance in 2020."

For the past several days, Americans have heard two public officials’ very different ways of speaking and learned why fluency and persuasion are so critical in times of crisis. This is true not only of content but also of bearing: How do the words and poses chosen by our leaders inform morale as we hunker down in our homes?
On one screen Monday, President Trump spoke at length about himself (and at times about the coronavirus). More than once, he wandered off script, at one point talking about how many billions of dollars he could have made had he not become president. But, he added, he was glad he had because he’s now a wartime president and, presumably, one was to infer, the country needs him.
How are people supposed to feel when they hear this? To each his own, but I fear a selfish child is in control of our fates.
On another screen, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo updated New Yorkers and the nation about the virus in his state. Unlike Trump’s self-indulgent soliloquies, Cuomo’s statements were straightforward, honest, factual and, despite the dire statistics, refreshingly reassuring. He understands that adults can absorb information and respond appropriately.
As of Tuesday, Cuomo (D) reported that New York had more than 25,000 cases of covid-19, about seven times more than New Jersey, which has about 3,600 cases, and more than 10 times the number of the next two most infected states, California and Washington, each of which has about 2,200 cases. The apex of New York’s crisis will come sooner and will be higher than expected, he said. The state has only about two to three weeks before the worst-case scenario arrives. Cuomo said the state needs 30,000 ventilators before then.
Cuomo came down hard on the federal government for stockpiling 20,000 ventilators desperately needed in New York. He suggested that the feds deploy the ventilators according to need, then rotate them out to the next state as its apex is reached, and so on.
“How can we be in a situation where you can have New Yorkers possibly dying because they can’t get a ventilator, but a federal agency saying I’m going to leave the ventilators in the stockpile?” he asked. “I mean, have we really come to that point?”
No doubt, many are wishing Cuomo were president right now, as suggested by a hashtag trending on Twitter — #CuomoForPresident. The governor’s in-charge demeanor and straight talk remind us of what a leader looks and acts like.
Trump has done some good things, such as closing down traffic from China and speeding up the approval of experimental drugs, but there’s more he could and should do. Only on Tuesday did reports emerge that the administration would formally implement the Defense Production Act to secure production of masks and test kits. This is such an easy call, but Trump dillydallied. He equivocated. He scared people.
On Monday, he and Cuomo expressed nearly the same idea but in such different ways. Guess which one was terrifying and which sounded plausible and realistic.
Trump signaled that he was thinking of “opening up” the country to avoid allowing the cure to be worse than the problem. He probably meant that shutting down the economy might hurt the United States more than the virus. His solution, however, would be to end lockdowns even as the virus is spreading.
Cuomo framed nearly the same idea in a vastly different way. Explaining that we had hit pause to grapple with the sudden crisis, he said it was now time to begin thinking about how to reenter the private sector. He suggested that young, healthy people might be able go back to work, as could those who have had the virus and are now immune.
One man drops a word bomb; the other explains his thoughts in logical fashion so that people can follow his reasoning and arrive at the same conclusion.
We like to say that some people are just “born leaders,” but we all know, instinctively, that the best leaders are not so much born as made, made in unexpected moments they didn’t choose and could not have foreseen. President George W. Bush’s most eloquent moment consisted of 11 words. “I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you!” he shouted through a bullhorn to first responders as they dug through the debris of the World Trade Center. In those few words, Bush connected the world to America and made America’s loss the loss of the wider world.
Cuomo’s moment has arrived. As he wrapped up Tuesday morning, his throat seemed to tighten as he expressed his love for New York and said: “At the end of the day, my friends, even if it is a long day . . . love wins, always, and it will win again through this virus.”
Give that man a bullhorn."
"March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/refusing-free-money-is-a-sign-of-fear/2020/03/22/f945391c-6c90-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html,The Washington Post,Refusing Free Money Is a Sign of Fear,"Fear is when you want to pick up the shiny nickel lying in the road, but freeze at the sound of the approaching steamroller. The currency market equivalent of this is a widening basis swap — free money that banks are too scared to pocket. For the fourth time in the past decade, the fear gauge is starting to go wild. 
Don’t ignore the warning, particularly in South Korea, a reliable indicator of trouble in the past. What’s happening in an esoteric corner of currency markets will also shape banking trends.
When two parties swap currencies for, say, five years, every three or six months each earns interest in the currency it bought, and pays interest in the currency it sold. The dollar is usually involved: Someone, somewhere always wants the greenback to oil the wheels of commerce. It shouldn’t cost too much more to obtain dollars this way than to borrow them in the London interbank market. If it did, global banks would jump right in to arbitrage away the difference and make risk-free money in the process. 
That used to be true before the 2008 crisis. Since the advent of the Dodd-Frank legislation and the Volcker rule, however, Wall Street banks’ risk appetite has dwindled, and a gaping basis swap spread — a numerical measure of badly wanting dollar funding and not getting it — has become a reliable indicator of nervousness around the world. One such squeeze is currently on. 
You see it in South Korea, where the roundabout way of raising dollar funding that I just described cost as much as 3% for three months Thursday, a hefty 2-percentage-point premium over the three-month Libor. That’s a lot of nickels begging to be picked up by global banks. But the crumbling of their own share prices amid the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus is making lenders hesitant to expand their balance sheets. Might as well save capital for a share buyback.
The G-10 average of basis swap spreads, a favorite gauge of fear for researchers at the Bank for International Settlements, suggests the tightness in the dollar market has risen with the trade-weighted U.S. currency. But the aggregate picture, while deteriorating, isn’t as bad yet as during the financial crisis. The G-10 basis swap spread is less than half as wide as it was in 2009, the euro zone troubles of 2011 or the 2016 dislocation after China’s sudden devaluation of the yuan. 
The Korean won-dollar spread, however, is off the charts. It’s worrying, because South Korea has acted as a canary in the coal mine before. In 2007, Korean basis swaps started acting up in June — 15 months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Exporters wanted dollars, and they weren’t getting them. The situation was brought under control only after the Federal Reserve authorized temporary dollar-liquidity-swap arrangements with 14 central banks, including the Bank of Korea, between December of that year and October 2008. 
The Fed resuscitated the emergency lines late Thursday in Asia. Help couldn’t have arrived a moment sooner. A country’s hard-currency reserves — and Korea has $409 billion now, compared with $250 billion in June 2007 — are seldom enough to make widespread panic go away. Regional reserve sharing arrangements, such as the Chiang Mai Initiative mutual-support network established by some Asian central banks, don’t work when trouble comes at the same time for everyone. 
Liquidity woes are showing up in other markets, too. Exchange traded funds that track bond indexes have suddenly stopped following them, and Wall Street banks are reluctant to make money by closing the gap. 
What more can be done? One lesson from previous episodes, like the squeeze that erupted during the 2013 taper tantrum, is to avoid defending exchange rates. The rupiah has weakened 11% this year, the most of any Asian currency. But because it has adjusted swiftly, it’s relatively easier for Indonesian banks to get dollar funding. 
The other important lesson is this: King dollar is the currency of global multinationals, many of whom are now Asian. The banks that supply them, in good times and bad, will be wanted by every national banking regulator in their counties. But who are these white knights? That question will be tackled in a subsequent column co-authored with my colleague Nisha Gopalan."
"March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/03/24/student-loans-collection-coronavirus/,The Washington Post,"Education Department to halt collection of defaulted student loans, refund $1.8 billion","As Americans face the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration plans to halt the seizure of wages, tax refunds and Social Security benefits of people who have defaulted on their federal student loans.
The decision, first reported by Politico, builds on earlier efforts by the Education Department to help borrowers amid waves of layoffs and economic uncertainty. The administration is allowing people to suspend their payments and waiving interest of federal student loans for at least 60 days, but the latest move could be the most consequential for people struggling with debt.
On Wednesday, the Education Department said it will refund about $1.8 billion to more than 830,000 borrowers whose wages, Social Security payments and tax refunds have been garnished since March 13. The federal agency expects the number of people who will benefit to increase as student loan servicers, the middlemen who collect payments on behalf of the government, work through additional offsets in the queue.
In documents obtained by The Washington Post, the department informed the private collection agencies it uses to stop calling borrowers, issuing notices or billing statements. Collection companies, however, are still allowed to receive calls from people inquiring about their debt.
The Education Department has stopped all requests to the U.S. Treasury Department to withhold money from defaulted borrowers and will hold off on transferring new accounts to its private debt collectors for at least 60 days from March 13.
“These are difficult times for many Americans, and we don’t want to do anything that will make it harder for them to make ends meet or create additional stress,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Wednesday in a statement. “Americans counting on their tax refund or Social Security check to make ends meet during this national emergency should receive those funds, and our actions today will make sure they do.”
There are more than 9 million Americans who have not made a payment on their federal student loans in nearly a year — defaults that would typically place them at risk of having a portion of their paycheck, Social Security or disability income garnished by the federal government.
“This was the right thing to do,” said Adam S. Minsky, a Boston-based attorney who represents student loan borrowers. “People are desperately struggling with reduced income and job loss, and every penny matters.”
Consumer groups have spent weeks urging the administration to take more decisive action to help borrowers and pushing liberal lawmakers to do the same. Congressional Democrats have proposed a series of measures to help borrowers, including the suspension of involuntary collections, in the economic relief package, but their efforts have been stymied by partisan fights over a proposal to cancel $10,000 in student debt for each borrower.
Alexis Goldstein, senior policy analyst at the liberal think tank Americans for Financial Reform, called the Trump administration’s announcement a “crucial first step,” but said Congress needs to codify the halt in collections and extend it back further than March 13.
“At this time of crisis when so many defaulted borrowers are more strapped for cash than ever, everyone who’s had wages garnished in 2020, or had their tax refunds already seized due to a defaulted student loan should get refunded,"" Goldstein said."

People who suspect they’re suffering from Covid-19 symptoms are being told to self-isolate. But they also need to seek medical advice. Many are turning towards telemedicine providers, who eliminate the need to leave home by connecting the potentially ill with medical professionals in a telephone or video call. For healthcare providers, a remote consultation is considerably more cost effective (and safer) than an in-person visit.
Telemedicine has for years promised a great deal, but previously delivered very little. All of a sudden it looks like it has genuine potential. French firm Doctolib SAS said last week that it had seen an 18-fold jump in the number of video consultations in the past month. U.S. health insurers have meanwhile agreed to cover coronavirus-related telemedicine, while the federal government has made it easier for Medicare recipients to use.
Investors are keen on buying into an industry that the market leader, Teladoc Health Inc., estimates could be worth $10 billion in annual U.S. revenue. Shares in Teladoc, the sector’s only publicly traded firm of note, have doubled in value since the start of the year – the S&P 500 is down about 30% in the same period.
With a $12 billion market valuation, Teladoc trades on 16 times predicted 2020 sales, according to Bloomberg data. That would make it the most highly valued stock in a basket of hot software companies compiled by Jefferies analysts David Windley and Ben Flox. Even tech darling ServiceNow Inc., a cloud computing firm, trades at 10 times expected sales. Small wonder analysts have been revising down their recommendations on Teladoc stock.
Superficially, the conditions are ripe for matching investment capital with an industry that needs to grow. When Tesla Inc.’s stock enjoyed a similar jump in January and February, the electric vehicle manufacturer did an opportunistic share sale. But things aren’t quite so simple for the telemedicine industry.
Volatile markets make it hard to see how Teladoc, whose shares have seen 20% swings, could sell equity or one of its rivals could raise money by going public. Venture capital firms are also targeting resources on the defense of existing investments rather than seeking out new ones. To meet the surging demand effectively, they likely need that money.
Questions over where telemedicine’s profitability will settle may also make investors pause. As with any new sector, first-mover advantages may be eroded over time by competition. New entrants have been emerging fast, with venture capital piling into the burgeoning health-tech sector. In 2018, $895 million was invested in telehealth startups, according to PitchBook data.
While Teladoc’s share-price surge is comparable to Tesla’s, its business model is more akin to Uber’s: it’s essentially a two-way marketplace. The value resides partly in the software that poses questions to patients to ensure they’re directed to the most suitable physician. The main barrier to entry is signing up enough doctors to attract patients, and (although less so today) enough patients to use the service.
In tech, the usual method of addressing such problems is to throw money at them — in this case, by providing generous financial incentives to both sides of the market to sign up. As Uber, whose software connects riders to the nearest driver, has found, fights to outspend rivals may be best avoided. The ride-hailing company sold regional businesses to well-capitalized competitors in India, China and southeast Asia — cashing out of markets where it lacks scale instead of getting into price wars in the hope of eventually emerging as the dominant player.
The need for capital is underscored by the operational challenges raised by Covid-19. Providers are still struggling to enlist sufficient doctors to meet demand, and are facing tech issues too, CNBC reported last week. Doctolib has an advantage, since it already has a database of doctors from its original business arranging medical appointments more efficiently.
The industry has an opportunity to lessen the strain on the global health system. But whether it can overcome financial and operational constraints to make a significant difference to the current crisis remains to be seen."

There were $3.66 trillion of commercial mortgage-backed securities outstanding at the end of 2019, more than one-fifth of the overall U.S. mortgage securities market. And the signs of distress are appearing.
Real estate investor Tom Barrack has issued dire warnings of a “domino effect” of margin calls, cross defaults and other related debt failures if financing in the sector dries up. To prove his fears might be well placed, Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc., a real estate investment trust, said on Tuesday that it can’t make its margin calls (demands for extra capital or securities that kick in when asset prices fall). It won’t be alone.
The coronavirus-inflicted crisis of confidence is also afflicting the primary market for commercial property debt as deals slated for sale aren’t being completed. A syndicate of banks led by Citigroup Inc. — and including Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc and Societe Generale — has been left holding billions of dollars of debt on a Las Vegas casino deal, involving currently shuttered MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay properties, according to Bloomberg News.
This won’t be the last project that debt investors back away from, leaving the underwriting banks exposed. And unfortunately, this isn’t just about large, well-capitalized banks being overgenerous in financing risky projects. This could become a systemic problem if risk appetite is pared to the bone. If things keep heading in this direction, the world’s other central banks will be looking to take their lead from how the Fed’s prepared to respond. The commercial property market is under severe strain internationally because of the Covid-19 enforced shutdowns of retail and leisure businesses.
That said, the commercial mortgage-backed security market is considerably larger in the U.S. than elsewhere, and has a much wider variety of credit quality. In Europe, there are measures in place to manage the fallout from similar asset-backed securities, although commercial mortgage-backed stuff is rarer there. The European Central Bank doesn’t buy the latter, but it has already purchased more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) of investment grade asset-backed securities in an ongoing program
A crisis in commercial property could force the Fed and other central banks to ease up on a lot of accounting regulations, maybe by not making lenders mark assets to market prices and allowing more forbearance on loans. It might even require the Fed and the U.S. Treasury to build further on its bailout template from the last financial crisis and restart the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to buy toxic assets directly. It used the Public-Private Investment Program (P-PIP), unveiled back in March 2009, to buy legacy loans and securities.
This time around, the U.S. has already restarted the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), but that doesn’t include non-public distressed real-estate assets and commercial property derivatives. 
The Fed has fired several bazookas in response to the virus crisis, including unlimited Quantitative Easing for Treasury bonds and residential mortgage-backed debt. It’s even buying investment-grade corporate bonds, to the despair of some. But it won’t end there. The wider risk now is how commercial real estate copes if the banking system gums up its access to financing."

With tea and cigarettes, they were watching a pivotal clash over the fate of Idlib province, engulfed by some of the most destructive violence of Syria’s nine-year war. The battlefield on the horizon was around Saraqeb, a town with the misfortune to be situated near the junction of strategic highways. Like many places in Idlib, it had been emptied of people, and the combatants — loyal to Syria, Turkey or Russia — were pounding the town’s bones.
Warplanes carried out airstrikes, raising a row of towering gray plumes on the horizon. “This is every day,” Shardan said, as the sound of shelling grew louder. “I sleep with bombing. I wake to bombing.”
In a war with too many terrible chapters to count, the fighting in Idlib and surrounding areas has been singularly brutal, spreading destruction over a large swath of Syria while uprooting legions of its citizens. The violence has been drawn out by seesaw clashes that left towns like Saraqeb wasted and empty.
The nature of the standoff in the province, between emboldened Syrian government forces and die-hard opposition fighters, has made Idlib an especially daunting and tragic riddle to solve.
Not long after Shardan and his neighbors watched the battle for Saraqeb, the fighting slowed. Russia and Turkey agreed to a cease-fire earlier this month. It came after nearly 1 million people in Idlib had been displaced and aid agencies were warning of an unprecedented humanitarian disaster.
But the cease-fires here never last.
For Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Idlib is a nuisance, standing in the way of his desire to reassert control over the country and crush the insurrection against his rule. Backed by Russian air power, Syria’s army has attempted a series of blistering offensives, including the latest, which began in December.
Standing in the army’s way are thousands of rebel fighters, among them foreign fighters and other extremists. For many of them, Idlib is a last stand.
Turkey, which supports some of the rebel groups, sent thousands of troops to Idlib in February to prevent a final defeat of the opposition and stop a Syrian advance that could send hundreds of thousands of refugees across Turkey’s border.
Between the combatants are millions of Syrian civilians ­facing astounding hardship: scrambling for food and shelter, searching for doctors and fleeing relentless Syrian and Russian airstrikes. Those who survive live a miserably nomadic existence, having fled to Idlib from other parts of Syria only to spend their days fleeing one battered town after another.
In overcrowded camps on Turkey’s border, another menace now looms: the novel coronavirus, whose spread through the crowded settlements is a foregone conclusion, Syrians and aid workers say.
Shardan had been trying to outrun the government for months. He fled Maarat al-
Numan, in southern Idlib, late last year and settled in Ariha, about five miles south of Idlib city, until heavy shelling on the town sent him and his family back on the road.
Idlib, a bastion of opposition to Assad’s rule in northwestern Syria, has braced for a battle since at least 2015, when two milestones — the capture of Idlib by extremist rebels, and Russia’s military intervention in support of the Syrian government — set the province on a perilous course.
The danger grew as rebel-held territory in other parts of Syria fell to government forces and residents and rebel fighters from those areas were bused to Idlib, transforming the province into a dumping ground for Assad’s opponents and a frequent target of government airstrikes.
An agreement two years ago between Russia and Turkey ­created a demilitarized zone between Assad’s forces and opposition fighters and temporarily staved off a Syrian government offensive. But Moscow and Ankara accused each other of violating the agreement.
Syria and Russia, determined to recapture Idlib and nearby areas, continued to attack targets in the province, including hospitals and other civilian facilities. Turkey — because it was unwilling or unable — never curbed the influence of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, a rebel group that was formerly affiliated with al-Qaeda and dominates Idlib province, said Dareen Khalifa, a senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group who frequently travels to the province.
When Syria launched its first major offensive on Idlib, in April last year, government forces confronted “tens of thousands of fighters that think, ‘This is it — this is the last battle.’ If they surrender, it is going to be death,” she said.
It also targeted a civilian population that included people who “haven’t seen the state in eight or nine years,” she said. For many, a return to life under government rule was unthinkable. “They think it’s suicidal to move toward the regime, or at best, it’s unknown,” she said.
The Syrian government made no attempt to convince them otherwise. Rather, as the army advanced on Idlib over the last few months, it seemed determined to drive people from their homes.
The destruction was apparent in the town of Atareb, in the countryside of Aleppo, where rebel fighters on motorcycles zoomed past pummeled gray cinder-block houses on deserted streets. Some of its residents had settled in nearby Ad Dana, in tents erected precariously on rocky hillsides.
On Idlib’s highways, its nomads carry tales of sacked cities and towns.
Ibrahim Ahmed el-Saeed drove north on a recent evening from Idlib city with his wife and four young children on a three-wheeled buggy, stacked high with what he said was a quarter of all his belongings: mattresses, an oven, a cooler, a toolbox and a motorcycle.
Weeks earlier, they had fled Syrian army forces in southern Idlib and temporarily found shelter farther north near Turkey’s border. But as new families arrived, their tent became too crowded, and he and his family drove back down to southern Idlib on the little buggy, which could manage about 24 miles per hour. When he arrived home, he was greeted by an inferno of shelling and airstrikes. So his family set out on the road again.
Huda Fathullah, 40, had fled her home, and then a succession of nearby villages in southern Idlib in recent months, before settling in a stadium in Idlib city with seven members of her family. “We left everything,” she said, adding that she had no idea whether they would ever be able to return home.
The fate of Idlib was in the hands of fighters and far-off states. “May God solve it,” she said."

Chinese companies are looking at $120 billion of debt repayments this year on their U.S. dollar denominated debt. Real estate developers and industrial companies make up three-quarters of the outstanding $233 billion of junk-rated bonds. There’s another $563 billion of higher-rated debt. The question isn’t just whether they’ll be able to pay their debt. It’s worth wondering how they can access the needed dollars — and at what cost.
Globally convulsing markets have put a strain on U.S. dollar funding. In China, signs of tightness in dollar liquidity are emerging, based on 3-month interbank overnight rates and other indicators. Banks are trying to beef up dollar cash positions. Meanwhile, yields on big chunks of Chinese debt have shot to over 15% as investors unload, increasing the cost of borrowing and refinancing. 
Hedge funds and other asset managers that bought up junk-rated Chinese dollar debt are unwinding those positions. In times like these, investors aren’t discriminating. The pain will persist: Credit markets don’t reprice risk as quickly as equity markets.
Debtors need dollars now. These companies have typically resorted to raising more debt to refinance the old. They won’t be able to continue like this. Not only has it gotten prohibitively expensive, it’s hard to find buyers at this point. 
Take real estate developers. They make up around 60% of the outstanding bonds and primarily rely on onshore yuan revenue from advanced payments and deposits on purchases. With sales down sharply, that cash is waning and swapping it to dollars costs more. Further, regulations restrict raising debt for refinancing. This month, developers have around $4 billion coming due, with smaller repayments until November, when $6.7 billion must be repaid. That comes as companies across emerging markets are staring at $19 trillion in maturities of dollar and local currency loans and bonds over the course of 2020.
Even with the People’s Bank of China willing to provide various lifelines, private enterprises’ funding costs remain elevated. Raising more debt in domestic capital markets to repay dollar obligations isn’t easy or cheap. Onshore, state-backed borrowers are pushing out smaller ones and flooding the new issuance space.Defaults have been ticking up as Beijing goes into forbearance mode. Estimates from the Institute of International Finance suggest that companies with majority state ownership comprise over 35% of non-financial firms’ debt in China. Add in those with any government backing, and it’s more than 80%. Will Beijing step in for all? Unlikely, but it’s still on the hook for a significant chunk. While onshore investors are agreeing to extend payment terms and to exchange debt for equity, holders of foreign bonds are unlikely to be so forgiving.Tapping Chinese banks for funds isn’t straightforward. They don’t have dollars to hand out en masse. Of the $788 billion of total foreign currency deposits held by financial institutions, $377 billion are corporate deposits. That’s down from a peak two years ago.  Banks have more than $800 billion of foreign currency loans on their books. Along with the lending for China’s Belt and Road Initiative, the virus-induced economic shock and rising bad debts mean banks will have to be selective.  
Investors usually find comfort in the PBOC’s war chest of $3.1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. Sure, it could — and will — step in to ease the dollar-funding pressure on banks. But the moment the lender of last resort starts tapping reserves, sentiment will be hit, and then it’s a question of resilience.In addition, these reserves are held in U.S. Treasuries, agency bonds and the like. Only about $18 billion, or 0.5%, are in cash deposits, mostly at commercial banks, according to HSBC Holdings Plc analysts. Selling those as the broader credit market tanks would only drive more market jitters. Unlike many central banks, China’s doesn’t have a swap line with the U.S. Federal Reserve. So how far will the central bank go?There are other pressure points. The dollar shortage will hit trade credit, crucial for China Inc.’s exports and underlying businesses. In periods of dollar strength and shortage, this leads to outflows as overseas financing to buy Chinese goods dries up. As Rhodium Group’s Logan Wright says, “In the 2008 crisis, this was very severe as trade-credit liabilities were paid down and credit lines were cut.” This time, he says, a dollar shortage in this type of credit would probably lead to “a sharper-than-expected decline in China’s exports” over the next few months. At some point, the credit risk becomes entrenched in balance sheets and coming back is hard. The longer these dislocations last, the worse they get.  "

“It is a very, very big thing; it is unprecedented,” the Pennsylvania Republican told reporters Wednesday on a conference call, adding it was an opportunity to lever up “the unlimited balance sheet of the Fed.” A Fed spokesperson declined to comment.
The Fed has launched a dramatic range of emergency measures to shelter the blow from the virus, which has brought important parts of the economy to a grinding halt. It has slashed interest rates to almost zero and is pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into financial markets to keep credit flowing while pledging to directly lend to U.S. companies for the first time.
Those actions were ramped up on Monday, when the Fed also announced it was working hard on a Main Street Business Lending Program to support small- and medium-sized businesses. It also launched facilities to support the secondary market for corporate debt, and to make direct loans or buy bonds directly from companies. Toomey’s comments suggest the corporate debt facilities could be expanded with the new funds.
“First thing is to make sure financial markets are working,” Toomey said. “I expect to see the Fed set up facilities.”"

Large parts of it are working like a real government — in Congress, at the state and local levels, and among civil servants and front-line responders. But the presidency is now just a daily talk show, hosted by a self-centered blowhard worried only about his poll numbers.
This leads to big achievements and to frightening problems. When President Trump, based on absolutely no data or analysis, explained on Tuesday that he wanted coronavirus health restrictions lifted by Easter because “I just thought it was a beautiful time” and because “Easter is a very special day,” he told us exactly what we needed to know: Even in the face of death and economic turmoil, there will never be anything serious about his presidency — except for the serious threat it poses to our collective well-being.
The real work in Washington was being done, first, on Capitol Hill. In the early-morning hours on Wednesday, senators across party lines agreed on a $2 trillion stimulus bill. It’s imperfect, and we’ll likely need more. But it’s far better than the original proposal by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
The opportunity for this authentic give-and-take was brought to life not by sermons about civility but by fear and sheer political power. All sides are petrified about the possibility of economic collapse. Democrats made good use of their control of the House of Representatives and McConnell’s need for Democratic Senate votes.
Thus, the final bill is more generous than the original draft to those in real need — in its unemployment insurance provisions and in providing the poorest Americans with the lump-sum payment from which they were originally excluded. The corporate bailout section has at least some accountability features, and significant sums will be spent to help our threatened hospital systems and state and local governments.
Of course, the proposal could have done more for the least advantaged — guarantee health insurance to everyone (isn’t that a logical policy goal in a pandemic?) and expand other forms of help to those most in need. And, yes, many progressives and libertarians will always have a healthy skepticism about government largesse toward big corporations. But the economy badly needs this record-breaking relief, and — while nothing is certain in life or in Congress — it looks likely to happen.
At the state level, New York’s Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is winning praise for his thoughtful, passionate and fact-based daily briefings and for trying to push Trump toward policies he should be pursuing anyway. Cuomo is the most public face of all the governors and mayors who have risen to the occasion, even if some “What? Me Worry?” state leaders — in Mississippi and Florida, for example — have been in denial over the virus’s threat.
And let’s note how right Cuomo was to praise doctors, health-care workers, police officers and firefighters, among others, who are “overcoming their fear . . . not for their family, they’re doing it for your family.” Yes, they are.
Which only sets Trump’s failures into sharper relief — his failure to take the crisis seriously at the outset, his failure to set up a comprehensive testing system, his failure to deploy the Defense Production Act to direct the private sector to produce the medical supplies and equipment we need and, above all, his failure to abandon his pettiness and self-involvement.
This is why Trump’s impulsive effort to start what amounts to a culture war over whether to lift health restrictions is so terrifying. As former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers argued in The Post, prematurely lifting restrictions could mean we “have to start the whole process over — and from a worse starting point.”
Trump doesn’t care, because he’s seeking an alibi for his own shortcomings. He’d love to say that our economic troubles are all the fault of public health experts. Arbitrarily calling for an end to social distancing policies (which he doesn’t control anyway) at “a beautiful time” on “a special day” got him exactly the headlines he wanted.
We do need a debate about how and when to transition back to a functioning economy — from “a big pause” to “a big restart,” as conservative economist James Pethokoukis put it. But that discussion needs to be informed by far more testing and by a genuine concern for our fellow Americans who are most vulnerable to the virus. We can pray that these deliberations will be led by the rational people in the functioning parts of government. They need to protect us from the reckless blame-shifter and excuse-maker in the White House."

Additionally, 82 full-time associates will receive an indefinite salary reduction.
Delaware North, the multibillion-dollar hospitality company led by Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs, issued its “temporary business stabilization measures” in a news release posted to the Bruins’ website.
“As relayed to our associates today, none of these decisions were reached without difficult and painful deliberations,” the release says. “These measures are intended to be temporary with associate employment and compensation returning once our business resumes to its normal state from this unprecedented stoppage.”
Delaware North has been owned by the Jacobs family for more than 100 years and has an annual revenue of about $3.7 billion dollars, according to the corporation. The Bruins said the leave measures and salary reductions set to go into effect April 1 are “intended to be temporary.”
The announcement of layoffs and pay cuts for Bruins and TD Garden workers came a day after ushers at TD Garden were laid off, according to a letter obtained by the Boston Herald.
The Bruins were the last team in the NHL to offer financial help to part-time workers. They eventually announced Saturday that the Jacobs Family established a $1.5 million fund to help out part-time, game day associates if — and only if — the six remaining regular season Bruins games are not played.
The NHL has been on pause since March 12, and players are continuing to self-quarantine with no real timeline of when hockey could resume.
On Tuesday, ownership of the New Jersey Devils and the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers, after facing widespread criticism, backtracked on a plan to cut salaries of their full-time employees.
Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Devils and 76ers, said that instead of implementing a temporary payroll reduction of up to 20 percent for all HBSE employees who make more than $50,000, the group would keep salaries unchanged.
“After listening to our staff and players, it’s clear that was the wrong decision,” Josh Harris, the founder of HBSE, said in a statement."

Such firms should be best positioned to keep money flowing to community businesses like restaurants, travel agencies and gyms on the brink of failure because of the coronavirus pandemic. But regional banks themselves are increasingly at risk, riven by years of low margins, bad debt and now the threat of ratings cuts.
At smaller lenders from the U.S. to Japan to South Korea, profits had already been pressured by historically low interest rates. The virus adds to their woes, boosting the risk that bad loans will pile up at the smaller businesses they serve.
Four South Korean regional banks were placed on review for downgrade this week by Moody’s Investors Service, which said the pandemic will hurt economic growth as well as banks’ credit quality. In the U.S., dozens of small banks called on lawmakers to delay major loan-loss accounting rules they say will force them to curtail lending.
Regionals are more exposed to “the plain old squeezing of the margin between where banks borrow and where banks lend,” Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Mike Mayo said in an interview. “As a group they’re more exposed” to the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cuts, he said.
Rate cuts worldwide have crimped banks’ net interest margins, the difference between what they earn from loans and pay for deposits, as well as interest income abroad. Analysts say that the virus could cause bad loans to jump in China, while more regional lenders in Japan may start to post losses if the central bank there cuts rates further.
‘Chief Concern’
“Rising loan losses would be a chief concern with the virus slowing economic activity globally,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Herman Chan. “The outlook for U.S. regional banks is challenging with loan losses set to rise and revenues weakening after the Federal Reserve rate cuts.”
The KBW Regional Banking Index of 50 U.S. lenders has tumbled more than 40% this year, with those exposed to energy particularly hard hit as virus fears sap demand and Saudi Arabia and Russia engage in a price war. Shares of Houston-based Cadence BanCorp, the worst performer in the group, have plunged almost 70%.
Investors are hungry for details about how the economic impact of the pandemic will hit firms’ geographies and industry concentrations -- and how a stimulus package could alleviate some problems.
“What’s unique is that it’s not one concentration that’s an issue, this is going to affect a lot of different types of industries that they lend to,” KBW analyst Brian Klock said in an interview. “They’re Main Street lenders, and that’s where it’s going.”
Concentrated Exposures
In South Korea, the asset quality of Busan Bank, Daegu Bank, Jeju Bank and Kyongnam Bank could deteriorate, Moody’s said. That’s because they have concentrated exposures to the regions worst-hit by the virus, namely Daegu and North Gyeongsang province, and highly affected sectors such as small- and medium-size enterprises in the tourism, services, food and beverage, and retail sectors.
In China, the virus may cause the nation’s non-performing loan ratio to more than triple to about 6.3%, amounting to an increase of 5.6 trillion yuan ($787 billion) in bad debt, according to S&P Global Ratings. A deterioration in banks’ asset quality and profitability are raising concerns that more regional lenders will come under pressure after at least three banks were rescued last year.“We have no doubt there will be more,” said Logan Wright, a Hong Kong-based director at research firm Rhodium Group LLC. “What we are waiting for is a kind of a road map or a path to how these restructuring will take place in the future.”"
"March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/25/congress-relief-bill-recession/,The Washington Post,"The $2 trillion relief bill is massive, but it won’t prevent a recession","The Senate just passed a $2.2 trillion relief package for the economy — the biggest in U.S. history — by a unanimous vote. The House is expected to approve it soon, and President Trump is eager to sign it.
The good news is that the majority of the money will go to laid-off workers, small-business owners, hospitals, and state and local governments. The bad news is that it won’t be enough to stop a recession. And it’s an open question whether the nation can avoid an economic depression, the likes of which haven’t been seen since the 1930s.
“By any measure, this is a huge stimulus package. One thing that it cannot stop is the recession that is coming,” said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Economists say Congress’s response was too slow, too stingy and too focused on big Wall Street firms during the Great Recession, and that prevented a faster turnaround. Many analysts say Congress deserves some credit for doing better this time. This relief package is more than double the $830 billion measure that Congress passed in 2009. It came together in a few days, and it’s far more targeted at Main Street.
Middle-class and low-income Americans are slated to receive $1,200 checks (more for people with children). Small-business owners will soon have access to $10,000 emergency grants and millions in loans. And additional money is set aside for the unemployed. Only about a quarter of the money will go to large companies this time, including billions earmarked for Boeing and airlines.
But economists say two key problems remain: fixing the health crisis and getting money to people in time.
Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG, predicts that it will take at least six to 10 weeks for the government to disburse a significant amount of the money. That’s a long time for laid-off workers and small-business owners with no money coming in to wait. It makes it less likely that they will bounce back quickly.
“There isn’t some magic restart button for the economy,” Hunter said. “Before the money arrives, there will be a lot of collateral damage to the economy. That’s going to make restarting it difficult.""
James Bullard, a noted economist and head of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, put out a chilling forecast of what’s ahead for the nation in the coming months: He expects 46 million Americans to be unemployed (30 percent of workers) and an unprecedented 50 percent decline in economic output.
Trump has floated the idea of getting people back to work by April 12. Yet public health officials say that they don’t think that is realistic and that going back too soon could cause a second spike in coronavirus cases and deaths, forcing more shutdowns.
The nation is choosing to shut down much of the economy to save lives, maybe as many as hundreds of thousands, according to one estimate. The United States has to get the pandemic under control before daily life and business can go back to anything remotely normal. It’s still a big unknown how long that will take.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared on the Senate floor Wednesday that “this is not even a stimulus package; it is emergency relief.” Economists agree. This $2 trillion isn’t about boosting the economy; it’s about trying to compensate people for what could be $2.5 trillion in lost business and wages in the coming weeks. And that’s a best-case scenario. Losses will be deeper if the pandemic lasts into the summer.
To prevent a depression, the relief payments have to get to workers and business owners fast enough to prevent a chain reaction of pain where one person goes out of business and that triggers another failure and another.
Bullard, the St. Louis Fed president, is optimistic that the economy will bounce back in the second half of 2020. He compares this to driving a car 70 miles per hour on the highway and then having to slow to a crawl for a construction zone. The hope is that the car can regain speed quickly, after exiting the construction zone, but it’s not a given.
“It’s not enough to have Congress pass something or to have the Fed put new programs into place to preserve liquidity, it’s actually the execution of those programs” that matters, he said.
To get a reality check on what’s happening to the U.S. economy, call a small-business owner. Nearly all will tell you that business is severely down — or closed — and that they have no clue when that will change. In recent days, most of these owners have talked to anyone they can think of — bankers, insurers, politicians, friends, customers, Small Business Administration officials — about getting a loan or aid. But everyone is waiting to see what Congress does first, leaving business owners fearful that they will run out of money before help arrives.
John Russell co-founded Webconnex, at small tech company, in 2008, but he says this crisis is even harder to navigate than the Great Recession, because it’s so uncertain when it will end and whether the recovery will be fast or slow. His company, which employs 41 people, makes affordable software for fundraising and events and processed about $1 billion in credit card payments last year. Now most of its 2020 events are canceled, leaving almost no money coming in.
“If we don’t get relief from this bill in Congress, we have no choice but to do massive layoffs,” Russell said. “Our team is like our family. For us, 100 percent of our focus is on saving those jobs.”
Russell has taken an ax to his budget. Advertising spending is gone. He cut up the credit cards. The company managed to end its lease in Sacramento at the end of the month. All trips are canceled. Those decisions are already rippling across the economy, cutting revenue for other businesses.
If he has to lay off employees, like so many restaurants and hotels have, Russell knows the pain will escalate. But taking on a hefty loan right now feels risky, given the uncertainty.
It’s a similar story for many states and cities hit hardest by the pandemic. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) is furious about the latest congressional package, saying that about $4 billion in aid is not nearly enough as the state tries to battle the virus and bolster health care and safety personnel during the crisis.
“I’m telling you these numbers don’t work,” Cuomo said to reporters.
There is no economic playbook for how to handle this health crisis. Congress and the White House have taken a first attempt at aid, but most economists anticipate more will be needed. And the only thing that will truly turn this around is ending the pandemic."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-dollar-crunch-is-europes-gift-to-asia/2020/03/25/db5c6e3c-6ef4-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html,The Washington Post,The Dollar Crunch Is Europe’s Gift to Asia,"Banks in Asia are suddenly shy to part with dollars. And who can blame them? Many of their corporate clients are borrowing the U.S. currency and depositing it with the same banks — just in case they can’t get the funding when they need it. 
The caution amid the coronavirus outbreak isn’t all that different from Amazon.com Inc. trying to discourage vendors from cornering toilet paper supplies. “Corporate banks are becoming a bit more discretionary about permitting draws on credit lines where hoarding cash is the sole objective,” according to Greenwich Associates consultant Gaurav Arora. 
The dollar squeeze is evident, as one of us wrote Monday, in the hefty premiums South Korean banks must fork out to borrow the U.S. currency — a reliable indicator of trouble in the past. It also appears that China’s banks may be less eager or able than before to fund the dollar needs of their corporate borrowers, Bloomberg Opinion’s Anjani Trivedi noted Wednesday.
For Asia, the crunch is an unwanted gift from European lenders, whose departure from the region post-2008, as well as regulations that reined in Wall Street firms, have led to a funding hole. Japan’s banks have expanded and lenders like BNP Paribas SA have scaled up trade finance, but they’re yet to fill the void, especially as troubled Deutsche Bank AG shrinks. The German lender was in the top five corporate banks in Asia in 2014; last year, it wasn’t even in the top 10, according to Greenwich. 
Some countries like Korea have felt the loss more keenly than others. U.K. banks’ exposure to Korea has dwindled to $77 billion from $104 billion in the first quarter of 2008. German lenders’ claims have fallen to $13 billion from $36 billion.
Japan’s lenders have taken up part of the slack. Driven by negative interest rates and aging demographics at home, they have dished out funds aggressively in Southeast Asia as well as to global deal-chasing clients like SoftBank Group Corp. The large U.S. operations of megabanks like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. also provide them with liquidity, as does their stack of fully convertible, cheap yen deposits. But some Japanese lenders have piled into off-balance sheet products, which suck liquidity in times of stress. Japan’s Norinchukin Bank, a lender to farmers and fisherman, was one of the world’s largest buyers last year of collateralized loan obligations, bundled U.S. leveraged loans.
When the Fed extended emergency swap lines to South Korea, Australia, Singapore and New Zealand last week to ease the worldwide dollar shortage, a step that our colleague Shuli Ren called for here, it was a sign that the liquidity problem was serious enough. Overall, the Fed gave temporary access to nine authorities in addition to the five that it has permanent arrangements with for making dollars available.(2) Emerging economies like India, Indonesia, Chile and Peru, though, have seen their requests for swap lines rebuffed in the past. The U.S. only helps those it sees as important to the stability of its own banking system.
So what can Asia do? Start with the most extreme case. Australia needs U.S. dollar funding not just for foreign-currency loans but also for Australian dollar mortgages. That’s because the domestic deposit base is small, compared with the size of the banking industry. The average loan-to-deposit ratio of Macquarie Bank Ltd. and other major Australian lenders was 126% versus 68% for the top Asian banks, namely DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Mizuho Financial Group Inc., MUFG, Standard Chartered Plc, and HSBC Holdings Plc, according to banking analyst Daniel Tabbush, founder of Tabbush Report.
Offshore funding sustains around one-third of major Australian banks’ total worldwide operations. While the International Monetary Fund and others have flagged the reliance on foreigners as problematic, the Australian regulators have so far refrained from discouraging lenders to borrow abroad. Yet, the fact that the country had to seek dollars from the Fed during the epidemic upheaval and auction them to its banks will call into question the sagacity of this relaxed approach. 
In rest of Asia, one lesson from the dollar squeeze is to shun protectionism. Well-capitalized regional banks like Singapore’s DBS could supplement the three traditionally entrenched foreign lenders: HSBC, StanChart, and Citigroup Inc., a big cash management bank for Western multinationals. DBS could emerge as an Asian global bank, though in good times its expansion has been stymied by regulators playing to nationalist political sentiment, as we saw when it wasn’t allowed to buy Indonesia’s PT Bank Danamon in 2013.
The next step may be to seek more intermediaries with scale. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is pumping top dollar into serving corporate treasuries as a safeguard against the fickle fortunes of investment banking. Japan’s lenders could also do more: MUFG is already one of the region’s most aggressive lenders and has the historical advantage of having a dollar clearing license, like HSBC. 
Unlike 2008, this isn’t a credit contagion yet, though that could change if large, messy financial bankruptcies were to erupt. But beyond the current crisis, the regulators must plan for the next squeeze. Since not everyone can rely on the Fed, the dollar supply chain is each country’s responsibility. At least until a credible alternative to the U.S. currency comes along. "
"March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-stock-buybacks-may-be-slowed-or-shut-by-the-virus/2020/03/26/a43a4154-6f1c-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html,The Washington Post,How the Stock Buyback Bazooka Has Been Silenced by Virus,"The effort to shore up U.S. businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic has brought new attention to the single biggest investment most big companies have made over the past decade: their own stock. The defenders of share buybacks say it’s often the most efficient use of capital. Critics say it has left firms vulnerable to the kind of shock the virus has produced. Either way, it’s been a vital support for equities -- but one that will probably be sharply curtailed for a while, for both economic and political reasons.
1. How big have buybacks been?
The past two years have been the busiest on record, according to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Companies flush with cash from a 2017 tax cut bought back a record $806 billion of shares in 2018, a figure that slipped to $729 billion in 2019. For members of the S&P 500 Index, buybacks have exceeded dividends in every quarter since 2010.
2. What’s happening now?
Buybacks started to slow in the beginning of the year, with U.S. repurchases totaling $122 billion in January and February, down 46% from a year earlier, according to the report. This slowdown -- which coincided with a peaking stock market -- gathered pace in recent weeks as a growing number of companies across the world suspended the practice to conserve cash. The S&P report described second-quarter prospects as “dismal” and said buybacks may be slow to come back due to potential government restrictions as well as public-image concerns.
3. Who’s pulling back?
Eight giant U.S. banks responsible for some of the largest buybacks globally in the past year, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., agreed to stop buying back their own shares through the second quarter. The banks had planned to spend a combined $119 billion in the four quarters after the Federal Reserve’s stress tests last June. Among Europe’s most prolific buyers of its own shares, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, canceled the next tranche of its $25 billion buyback program. For whatever reason, cutting off buybacks removes one more prop of a shaky equities market. And not just in the U.S.: Barclays Plc strategists wrote in a note to clients on March 25 that European equities are losing support from buybacks, which “acted as a crucial backstop during periods of rising market volatility last year.”
4. What do buybacks have to do with stimulus packages?
In short, it’s the horrible optics of a company using money from the government to enrich shareholders. Buybacks have been denounced by both the right and the left. President Donald Trump said earlier this month he was unhappy with companies that used money saved from his 2017 tax cut to buy back shares rather than build domestic factories. A repeat of this would go against the intention of any bailouts, which is to support workers, he said. Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pushed to include a permanent ban on buybacks as a condition for government aid. She and others noted that the five biggest U.S. airlines -- prime targets for government bailout funds -- spent 96% of their free cash flow on repurchases over the past decade.
5. What was decided?
A bipartisan bill agreed to in the Senate included a requirement that any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. Those companies also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers.
6. How did buybacks get so big?
Against the backdrop of President Ronald Reagan’s deregulatory drive in the 1980s, restrictions on buybacks were loosened, executives were granted a safe harbor from stock-price manipulation charges and a culture of “shareholder value” was born. A wave of hostile takeovers made sitting on a pile of cash seem dangerous. And managers’ bonuses were increasingly tied to stock performance, to align their incentives with those of shareholders. The result? Buybacks boomed, often paid for with increased borrowing.
7. Companies borrowed to buy stock?
Yes. In the Reagan-era worldview, this was good: Tax breaks made debt a cheaper form of financing, and the need to make regular interest payments could focus executives’ minds on generating more cash. Over the next few decades, the stock market’s perceived function -- raising money for business ventures -- was turned on its head, as stocks became a vehicle largely for returning money to shareholders. Any gain in the share price caused by a buyback goes untaxed as long as the shares aren’t sold, and capital gains are also usually taxed at lower rates than dividends.
8. What’s the benefit of buybacks beyond making shareholders richer?
Proponents argue that if managers can’t see a better opportunity for profitable investment, perhaps there isn’t one. Buybacks are thus seen as a good vehicle to get funds out of the hands of executives who might otherwise waste them on pet projects and speculative investments.
9. What are the arguments against?
Some critics, including Warren and U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, argue that buybacks are great for shareholders but bad for employees, harming the long-term growth of the economy and exacerbating inequality. A different line of criticism says that the widespread use of buybacks isn’t good for shareholders either. With the majority of senior executive compensation tied to company stock, managers often take advantage of the pop that a stock price gets when a buyback is announced to sell some of the shares they’ve received through grants or options. Record-low interest rates make it easier to pile on debt for this purpose, which can prove detrimental in a crisis when cash flows dry up.
10. Is this an issue elsewhere?
While the U.S. leads the way in both the amount of buybacks and the intensity of political scrutiny, the practice isn’t unknown in Europe or Asia. In Japan, electronics powerhouse Sony Corp. announced a 100 billion yen ($900 million) buyback last year -- its first-ever major repurchase -- followed by another one twice as large just months after. The European Central Bank said earlier this month that it expects banks to take “prudent decisions” after unveiling support measures, while Germany’s financial watchdog Bafin said that lenders should avoid buybacks."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-cant-fix-the-ventilator-problem-but-right-now-hes-not-even-managing-it/2020/03/26/303416fa-6edf-11ea-a3ec-70d7479d83f0_story.html,The Washington Post,"Trump can’t fix the ventilator problem. But right now, he’s not even managing it.","VENTILATORS ARE the most critical device that can save lives in the struggle against the coronavirus. They are also the scarcest. No international authority governs the global allocation of ventilators; in the United States, no federal agency can satisfy any state’s full demand for the devices. For now, there is only chaotic scrounging.
Hence the recent back-and-forth over ventilators between President Trump and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) of New York, where a wave of covid-19 cases is projected to crest over the coming few weeks. “He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators,” Mr. Trump said of the governor. “You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,” said Mr. Cuomo.
Washington is now sending an additional 4,000 ventilators to New York, and the governor, in calmer tones, has acknowledged that no entity, including the federal government, can meet the state’s demand. That’s alarming because New York has managed to procure only half of the 30,000 ventilators it expects to need by mid-April; other states are likely to face similarly dire predicaments.
Before the pandemic, demand for ventilators was static. Now it’s incalculable, and manufacturers have no means to meet it in the coming months. That helps explain Mr. Trump’s reluctance to invoke the Defense Production Act of 1950, which empowers him to order production of equipment. In the case of ventilators, the order would be meaningless on the schedule required by New York and other states.
Existing ventilator manufacturers appear to be ramping up fast. Non-medical companies — Mr. Trump has mentioned big automakers — would need many months, at best, to produce a ventilator costing $50,000, composed of 1,750 unique parts and 1 million lines of software code. The president said automakers were already doing so; they are not.
New York’s need is unquestionably urgent. Mr. Cuomo is begging for ventilators from any source, promising to redeploy them where they are needed after his state manages the tsunami it expects next month.
In fact, that shouldn’t be the governor’s job. It should be managed by the federal government — by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for instance, the Defense Logistics Agency or the Department of Health and Human Services. Inevitably, the job will be ethically excruciating. But it can be managed, to a degree, by surging the supply to meet the demand when and where it arises.
Even with perfect administrative acumen, there may not be enough devices. A major manufacturer, Medtronic, is going all-out to quintuple production, with a weekly goal of 500 acute units made at its plant in Ireland in the coming weeks. Most of that, though not all, will probably go to the United States. Other major producers are also ramping up. That’s good for states bracing for the worst. It is also probably inadequate to satisfy aggregate demand in a timely way.
That leaves states in what amounts to a procurement free-for-all. The federal government can’t miraculously solve the supply problem. For now, it doesn’t appear to even be managing it."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-was-intentionally-classified-as-a-territory-in-virus-aid-bill-lawmakers-say/2020/03/26/4b8c4ba8-6f74-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html,The Washington Post,"D.C. was intentionally classified as a territory in virus-aid bill, lawmakers say","Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Thursday that the coronavirus relief package expected to pass the House of Representatives on Friday deliberately classified the District as a territory instead of a state, which means the city will get less than half of the funding it was expecting.
Van Hollen (D-Md.) said he doesn’t know how the District got lumped in with five U.S. territories — the city is almost always treated like a full-fledged state by the federal government when it comes to grants, highway funding, education dollars and food assistance. He said he would try to ensure the District receives the money it believes it was due retroactively, as well as in a future relief package.
“I was enraged by the fact that the District of Columbia was going to be shortchanged,” Van Hollen said in an interview. “I immediately talked to Senator [Charles E.] Schumer about it and was told that the Republicans had insisted on the formula the way it was in the bill.”
Asked why the District is not treated like a state in the bill, a spokesman for Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said: “Because Washington, D.C., is not a state. One can debate whether or not it should be, but that’s a separate discussion.”
The spokesman, Michael Zona, noted that although some Democratic senators objected to the D.C. funding formula, the 600-page relief bill passed the Senate unanimously.
“No one was trying to ‘shortchange’ any particular jurisdiction,” he said in a statement. “It’s unfortunate that some voices are attempting to inject partisanship into a bipartisan desire to provide broad relief during a pandemic.”
But D.C. officials and advocates, who are accustomed to Republicans targeting the city over social issues such as guns, marijuana and abortion, said denying the District money to fight a public health crisis takes political gamesmanship to a new level.
“It was curious that in this bill they decided to treat the District of Columbia in a very discriminatory way,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a news conference Thursday morning. “It really makes no sense unless you have some other motivation.”
The bill, passed late Wednesday in the Senate, calls for the District and five U.S. territories to divide $3 billion by population, giving the District about $500 million — less than half of the minimum $1.25 billion guaranteed to each state, officials said.
Confirmed coronavirus cases in D.C., by day
As of Thursday evening, the District had 271 known cases of covid-19, which is more than the five territories combined and more than 18 states, according to data gathered by The Washington Post.
The entirely urban nature of the District also means the virus has a better chance of spreading among residents living in rowhomes and apartments than in the suburbs and rural communities of neighboring Virginia and Maryland, D.C. officials say.
Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) — who raised the issue on a call with President Trump and the nation’s governors Thursday, according to a person on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks — said the funding slight illustrates the need for the District to achieve statehood, including full representation in Congress.
“Every state that has two senators was treated the exact same,” the mayor said in a news conference. “We don’t have two senators. And it matters not having two senators. And that’s why we have pushed so hard for statehood.”
She added, “There will be a lot of intrigue behind whose motives got us to this point.”
Spokespeople for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Schumer (D-N.Y.) did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.
Under Democratic control, the House is likely to vote on D.C. statehood legislation this year, for the first time in a generation. Lawmakers are expected to pass the bill, mostly along partisan lines. But McConnell has said the bill will go nowhere in the majority-Republican Senate, and he called the concept of D.C. statehood “full-bore socialism.”
“It was clearly intentional,” Van Hollen said of the decision to designate the District as a territory. “I don’t know all the motivations, except we do know Republicans are opposed to giving the people of the District of Columbia voting rights in the U.S. House and Senate.”
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the District’s nonvoting representative in the House, said the District has a better chance for full funding in the next round of virus-related relief if the bill starts in the House.
“Whoever over there [in the Senate] decided we should be lumped in with the territory has really defied precedent,” she said in an interview.
D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) organized 36 fellow attorneys general, including 10 Republicans, to write a letter to the president and legislative leaders asking for the District to receive at least $1.25 billion in funds.
“Given the District’s connections to nearby states, jeopardizing the ability to respond to the crisis puts not only District residents but all Americans at an increased risk,” the letter says.
The District has been used as bargaining chip in previous congressional negotiations. During a budget standoff in 2011, then-President Barack Obama agreed to language prohibiting the city from using local money to give low-income women access to elective abortions after House Republicans sought restrictions on federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
Despite decades of fighting for D.C. autonomy on policy matters, Bo Shuff, executive director of the statehood advocacy group DC Vote, said allies of the District never anticipated such tactics during a global pandemic.
“It’s not something we had on our radar to worry about, to be honest,” he said. “This is a new and different level than we’ve seen before.”"

For investors, a fallen angel is a company that has lost its investment-grade debt ratings -- a fall that can have costly consequences. The ranks of that category may be about to get far more crowded, as new economic woes push nearly $1 trillion of debt owed by companies that are currently barely above that level closer to the line. The market has already made up its mind on roughly a third of that, trading the bonds as if they’ve slipped into junk status, even if credit raters haven’t made that call.
1. What makes a fallen angel?
Generally speaking, a fallen angel is a bond that is downgraded to BB+ or below (categories considered junk, or, more politely, high yield) by at least two of the three major rating firms -- Moody’s Investors Services, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings -- after being formerly rated BBB- or higher (categories that are investment grade). Downgrades can happen when a company isn’t creating enough revenue or generating enough cash to service its debt, or when it takes on so much debt that its financial leverage -- usually calculated by debt as a measure of earnings -- becomes disproportionate.
2. What happens when bonds lose investment-grade status?
A fall to junk status affects both borrowers and investors. For companies, downgrades make borrowing more expensive. A downgrade that extends all the way to junk could mean a need to tack debt covenants to the formal contracts with bondholders. These covenants protect investors who agree to lend to the now-riskier issuer and, often, prevent the company from benefiting shareholders at the expense of bondholders. Junk status also can force a wave of selling by investment companies and funds whose mandates prevent them from holding credits below investment grade. The prices on the bonds may need to fall to compensate investors for holding a less liquid, or actively-traded security.
3. How did we get to this point?
It started with a decade of ballooning corporate debt that followed the 2008 financial crisis, as companies took advantage of record low interest rates. The size of U.S. investment-grade market has more than tripled to $5.7 trillion outstanding since then. Historically low borrowing costs over the last decade paved the way for companies to issue debt and pursue aggressive growth strategies with little consequence. On top of that, leniency by the rating firms allowed companies to maintain investment-grade ratings despite elevated leverage ratios. Investors hungry for higher returns in a low-yield market were willing to lend copiously even as warnings were sounded about the ability of so much debt to be carried through a downturn.
4. What’s happened?
The coronavirus pandemic has made those worries immediate. As companies saw their supply chain disrupted or demand for their products fall or both, earnings projections have been cast into doubt. That’s led traders to start to anticipate downgrades for an ever wider slice of this market.
5. Which companies might be next?
There are some smaller ones that won’t cause much of a market ripple, such as Macy’s Inc. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Then there are some biggies like Ford Motor Co., which already has one high-yield rating, and Occidental Petroleum Corp., one of many BBB energy companies teetering over the edge after a dramatic fall in oil prices. Either would be the largest issuer in the Bloomberg Barclays high-yield index.
6. How many may fall?
That’s not clear. Investors are largely zeroing in on the $868 billion of investment-grade debt that has at least one BBB- or equivalent rating, just one level above junk. Guggenheim Partners said $1 trillion of debt is potentially heading to high yield. As much as $140 billion of investment-grade debt could be downgraded this year, largely given the stress in the energy sector, according to UBS Group AG strategists led by Matthew Mish. At the prospect that lenders may effectively shut many companies out of the credit markets, there’s been a mad dash for cash, with firms increasingly relying on banks and other lenders to fill the gap.
7. Where did the expression ‘fallen angel’ come from?
A 1984 story in American Banker newspaper attributed it to David Solomon, head of Solomon Asset Management, which at the time was a leading investor in the emerging field of junk bonds. (He’s not to be confused with the current head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.)"
"March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/waffle-house-index-coronavirus/,The Washington Post,Things must be bad. Waffle Houses are closing.,"There exists in emergency response industry circles something called the “Waffle House Index.” It’s a measurement of how the popular breakfast chain is faring in an emergency situation. If the local Waffle House is open and serving a full menu, the index is green; open with a limited menu, it’s yellow; closed, it’s red.
And the Waffle House Index almost never hits red.
Well, now it has. More than 400 of the company’s 1,992 locations are closed because of the novel coronavirus. Public-health orders forbidding gatherings of more than 10 people in some jurisdictions have made it nearly impossible for restaurants to operate. Sales are down 70 percent nationwide, Waffle House said in a statement to The Washington Post.
“Hour by hour, Waffle House’s reality is changing,” the company said.
For the first time, the index is being used to measure the impact of a non-weather-related event.
“This week, we posted information on the number of Waffle House closures related to covid-19. We referred to the index as a way to help people understand how big of an impact this virus has had on the restaurant industry,” Waffle House’s statement continued.
“The reference to ‘code red’ also highlights the tremendous impacts that are being felt by many of our associates and their families. With so few customers visiting our restaurants, we are rapidly losing the ability to offer enough work hours for our associates to earn money needed to live their lives and pay their bills,” it said.
That means things must really be bad because Waffle House is one of the companies the disaster-response officials look to as a model of risk management.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency uses the informal metric to gauge the severity of a disaster. The chain is know for its ability to stay open during severe weather events. Supply chains are shored up. Workers are ready to go. Home Depot and Walmart have similar reputations.
“They know immediately which stores are going to be affected, and they call their employees to know who can show up and who cannot,” Panos Kouvelis, director of the Boeing Center for Supply Chain Innovation at Washington University in St. Louis, told occupational health and safety magazine EHS Today in 2011. “They have temporary warehouses where they can store food and most importantly, they know they can operate without a full menu. This is a great example of a company that has learned from the past and developed an excellent emergency plan.”
And thus was born the index, which former FEMA administrator W. Craig Fugate was said to consult regularly. It has been used during responses to hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. For example, when a powerful tornado ripped through Joplin, Mo., in 2011, killing 158 people and injuring more than 1,000, the local Waffle House remained open, and the index green.
But this is the kind of crisis that is not restricted to certain towns or states or even regions. Waffle House’s hardest-hit locations are along the Gulf Coast and in the Midwest, the company said. Most of the restaurants in Florida are still open, though, as are most of the 188 locations around Atlanta."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-are-we-going-to-have-an-election-in-november/2020/03/26/0aef10ca-6f8e-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html,The Washington Post,How are we going to have an election in November?,"It’s hard to focus on right now, but this November we’re going to have a presidential election that may be the most important in our lifetimes.
How, exactly?
All we can say for certain, in this plague year, is that we won’t do it the way we expected. The election will take place in the shadow of a pandemic that has affected every state in the union, killed more than 1,000 Americans thus far and dramatically changed how we live and work. We’re going to have to make this up as we go along.
Just three weeks ago, after the Super Tuesday primaries, it looked as though we would know by now who the Democratic challenger to President Trump would be. Former vice president Joe Biden’s lead in pledged delegates over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was on track to become mathematically insurmountable, and Sanders would almost surely have had to suspend or end his campaign. It was supposed to be all over but the shouting.
But because of covid-19, potentially decisive primaries in Ohio, Georgia and other states have been postponed. At this point, with most Americans asked or ordered to practice social distancing, it is unclear when it will be possible to resume the primary process — or how that can be done safely.
So the Democratic race is in suspended animation. Biden looks like the certain nominee, but this status has not been made official — and Sanders has not dropped out. There was supposed to be another debate between the two candidates in April, but the Democratic National Committee has not yet scheduled it. Sanders has said he is ready and willing to participate; Biden, perhaps understandably, has said that “I think we’ve had enough debates.”
The primaries, when they resume, will probably look and feel different. There will probably be much more of an emphasis on mail-in voting, which will make it hard or impossible for officials to report results on primary nights. That would mean no victory or concession speeches, which is just as well, since those ritualistic appearances would seem pointless in the absence of wildly elated or sorely disappointed crowds. And crowds of any kind, of course, are at this point out of the question.
If Sanders dropped out, all of the above would be academic — but only for the presidential race. State parties still need to choose candidates for important down-ballot contests, including Senate and House races. Somehow, the primaries have to be held.
What about the party conventions? As of now, the Democratic Party is planning to hold its convention July 13 to 16 in Milwaukee, and the Republican Party intends to gather Aug. 24 to 27 in Charlotte. That’s the idea, at least — and perhaps by summer it will be safe to return to politics as usual. But what if it isn’t?
Anyone who has been on the crowded, bustling floor of a major-party convention knows that even the most diabolical Bond villain could hardly design a more perfect environment to guarantee the spread of a dangerous pathogen. Attendees come from around the country and spend four days in the closest proximity, sitting cheek by jowl, squeezing past one another, glad-handing with other delegations, cheering and chanting and otherwise expelling whatever happens to be lurking in their respiratory tracts.
Normally, that’s not a serious problem — some people might go home with colds that they end up passing on to family and friends. But this year? Seriously?
And then the sprint to November is supposed to begin. In a best-case scenario, the novel coronavirus that causes covid-19 may turn out to be seasonal, like influenza, and new infections could naturally decline during warm-weather months. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday he believes this may be the case. That means we might get a respite. But it also means, Fauci said, that we should prepare for a second wave of infection and transmission when the weather again turns cold.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu season usually begins in October. If covid-19 follows that schedule, that second wave would begin washing over the nation just before Election Day.
We have to start imagining a presidential campaign without campaigning. Will there be rallies? Will “pressing the flesh” seem a dangerous bygone practice? Will the battle take place exclusively on television and online?
It will be challenging to hold a legitimate national election in the shadow of covid-19. The time to start planning how to do this is now."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-government-mask-stockpile/2020/03/26/89d729c8-6f5b-11ea-96a0-df4c5d9284af_story.html,The Washington Post,U.S. government has 1.5 million expired N95 masks sitting in an Indiana warehouse,"Nearly 1.5 million N95 respirator masks are sitting in a U.S. government warehouse in Indiana and authorities have not shipped them because they are past their expiration date, despite Centers for Disease Control guidelines that have been issued for their safe use during the coronavirus outbreak, according to five people with knowledge of the stockpile.
Department of Homeland Security officials had a conference call Wednesday to figure out what to do with the masks, which are part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s emergency supplies. DHS officials decided to offer the respirators to the Transportation Security Administration, whose workforce has been clamoring for protective equipment, according to three of the people who described the plans on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
CBP has no plans to offer the masks to hard-hit hospitals, or hand them over to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, three of the people said.
The N95 masks, which provide essential protection to medical personnel treating infected patients, are one of the items that have gone lacking in New York City hospitals and across the country in recent days as demand for equipment soars. Manufacturers have said the masks remain effective if stored properly, and the main risk with age is that the masks’ elastic bands can weaken and prevent a proper seal against a user’s face.
According to two of the people with knowledge of the CBP stockpile, the masks are stored in a warehouse in Indianapolis.
Nathan Peeters, a CBP spokesman, said the agency is aware the supplies are available and that it has been “working with our DHS partners to determine the best use for N95 respirators in CBP’s emergency stockpile.”
The agency has provided a 30-day supply of protective equipment to Border Patrol agents and CBP officers, including N95 respirators, Peeters said.
“U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s highest priority is to ensure the health, safety and security of our workforce and the American people,” he said. According to Peeters, the agency is in the process of acquiring and distributing 1.5 million additional N95 masks and other protective gear that would be shipped in coming weeks.
It was unclear Thursday when the expired N95 masks in the Indiana warehouse would ship. FEMA did not respond to questions about the CBP stockpiles.
TSA confirmed it has received an offer for a large quantity of N95 masks from CBP and that they will be distributed to airports as needed.
“TSA remains committed to the health and safety of our workforce and is now authorizing the use of eye protection and N95 respirators for employees,” said TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein. “Employees have had the option to wear surgical masks since the beginning of the pandemic, and use of TSA standard nitrile gloves continues to be mandatory when screening an individual or their property, which adds an additional layer of protection.”
One administration official with knowledge of the plans said the decision was made to provide the masks to TSA because FEMA has been able to acquire a large number of new masks for distribution this week. President Trump said during a White House briefing Wednesday that FEMA has shipped or is in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators and 20 million surgical masks for hospitals.
“And we have others that we think are going to be delivered pretty quickly,” Trump said.
The masks and other protective gear are in such short supply at some New York City hospitals that staff have been wearing plastic garbage bags and other improvised equipment as they hope to ward off infection while treating patients.
Health officials in Los Angeles County said its emergency supply of N95 masks is exhausted, encouraging doctors and nurses to consider reusing the disposable masks for multiple patients, a practice that is generally avoided because of the risk of spreading the virus among patients and hospital rooms.
The CDC issued new guidelines on Feb. 28 for the safe use of expired N95 masks, affirming that many models remain functional past their expiration date, provided they were properly stored. In normal circumstances, they would be discarded, but they still remain effective if the guidelines are followed.
“The respirators exceeding their manufacturer-designated shelf life are only being released due to the potential urgent demand caused by the covid-19 public health emergency,” the agency said.
“In the face of this emergency, the U.S. government believes that the respirators beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life should provide greater respiratory protection than surgical masks (i.e., medical masks) alone, improvised mouth and nose covers (e.g., bandannas), or no protection at all,” the CDC said.
A senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the masks, said the masks in CBP storage are in usable condition.
“The masks are fully capable,” the official said. “We’d never put the lives of the men and women at DHS at risk.”
Randolph “Tex” Alles, the acting undersecretary for management at DHS, has been tasked with figuring out how to distribute the CBP masks, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly. Alles did not respond to a request for comment."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-us-is-still-exceptional--but-now-for-its-incompetence/2020/03/26/4d6d1ade-6f9b-11ea-a3ec-70d7479d83f0_story.html,The Washington Post,It’s easy to blame Trump for this fiasco. But there’s a much larger story.,"When a crisis hits the United States, the country’s general instinct is to rally around the flag and wish the best for its leaders. That’s probably why President Trump has seen his approval ratings rise, even though he has had a delayed and fitful approach to this pandemic. But at some point, we Americans must look at the facts and recognize an uncomfortable reality. The United States is on track to have the worst outbreak of coronavirus among wealthy countries, largely because of the ineffectiveness of its government. This is the new face of American exceptionalism.
The United States now has the highest number of cases of covid-19 in the world, outstripping both China and Italy. The first line of defense against the disease is testing. On this key metric, the U.S. experience has been a fiasco: We started late, using a faulty test, and never quite recovered.
Trump’s claim that “anybody that wants a test can get a test” is a cruel hoax. Access to tests remains much worse than in most advanced countries. His assertion that the United States has tested more people than South Korea is nonsense because it doesn’t take into account that South Korea has less than one-sixth America’s population. Per capita, South Korea has done five times more testing than the United States, as of Wednesday. But forget about South Korea. Italy, a country not known for the smooth workings of its government, has tested four times as many per capita as the United States.
The United States has shortages of everything — ventilators, masks, gloves, gowns — and no national emergency system to provide new supplies fast. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) says his state will need 40,000 beds for critical care. It has only 3,000. That means many patients will die simply because they lack access to care that is available under normal circumstances. Not even three weeks into this pandemic, health-care workers are reusing masks, sewing their own and pleading for donations. In a searing essay in the Atlantic, Ed Yong writes, “Rudderless, blindsided, lethargic, and uncoordinated, America has mishandled the COVID-19 crisis to a substantially worse degree than what every health expert I’ve spoken with had feared.”
Why did this happen? It’s easy to blame Trump, and the president has been inept from the start. But there is a much larger story behind this fiasco. The United States is paying the price today for decades of defunding government, politicizing independent agencies, fetishizing local control, and demeaning and disparaging government workers and bureaucrats.
This was not always how it was. America has historically prized limited but effective government. In Federalist 70, Alexander Hamilton wrote, “A government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, must be, in practice, a bad government.” President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the modern federal bureaucracy, which was strikingly lean and efficient. In recent decades, as the scope of government has increased, the bureaucracy has been starved and made increasingly dysfunctional. In the 1950s, the percentage of federal civilian employees compared with total employment was above 5 percent. It has dropped to under 2 percent today, despite a population that is twice as large and a gross domestic product that is seven times higher (adjusting for inflation).
Federal agencies are understaffed but overburdened with mountains of regulations and politicized mandates and rules, giving officials little power and discretion. The Food and Drug Administration’s cumbersome rules and bureaucracy — which have proved a huge problem in this case — are just one example among hundreds. The scholar who has long studied this topic, Paul Light, notes that under President John F. Kennedy, the Cabinet departments had 17 “layers” of hierarchy. By the time Trump took office, there were a staggering 71 layers. Both political parties have contributed to the problem, making the federal government a caricature of bureaucratic inefficiency.
Most of these dysfunctions are replicated at the state and local levels with their own smaller agencies. The challenge of creating a national strategy is complicated by the reality that the true power in public health lies with 2,684 state, local and tribal systems, each jealously guarding its independence. We like to celebrate American federalism as the flourishing of local democracy. But this crazy patchwork quilt of authority is proving a nightmare when tackling an epidemic that knows no borders, and where any locality with a weak response will allow the infection to keep spreading elsewhere. What happens on Florida’s beaches doesn’t stay on Florida’s beaches.
It’s an easy cop-out to say the United States can’t mirror China’s dictatorship. The governments that are handling this pandemic effectively include democracies such as South Korea, Taiwan and Germany. Many of the best practices employed in places such as Singapore and Hong Kong are not tyrannical but smart — testing, contact tracing and isolation. But all these places have governments that are well-funded, efficient and responsive. In today’s world, with problems that spill across borders at lightning speed, “well executed government” is what makes a country truly exceptional."

“The president is protecting those people,” Mnuchin said Thursday on CNBC.
Unemployment benefit filings surged to a record 3.28 million last week as businesses shuttered and laid off workers as part of efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Mnuchin said the $2.2 trillion aid package the Senate passed late Wednesday will provide assistance to laid-off workers through unemployment insurance and cash sent directly to families. The legislation will also provide small businesses with support that Mnuchin said will encourage them to re-hire workers.
Mnuchin said he talks as many as 30 times a day with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to coordinate the U.S. governments response to the outbreak. The Treasury Secretary said he’s approved all of the Fed’s requests for lending facilities.
“We both have the same objective to protect American workers and companies,” Mnuchin said."

Who’s going to foot their bills in the event of an economic downturn like 2008? A financial crisis-like bailout won’t be a good look.
Heading into this slump, carmakers were hardly exercising restraint, splashing out on big, tech-savvy investments and electric vehicles. Many global brands like Ford Motor Co. botched their bets in China, the world’s largest market, and have struggled to keep up there as it weakened.
Now, from the U.S. to India, Vietnam and Thailand and elsewhere, auto giants are shutting down production. It means more than turning the lights off. Sales are expected to fall almost 15% this year to fewer than 80 million vehicles, according S&P Global Ratings. In the U.S., the drop may be the biggest since 2009. Even as China tries to get back to work, auto and parts factories will likely run at low capacity.
The pandemic is showing up vulnerabilities on balance sheets. Over the past two days, Moody’s Investors Services downgraded auto manufacturers including Toyota Motor Corp. and BMW AG, and put several others on review, including General Motors Co., citing “weaknesses in their credit profiles including their exposure to final consumer demand for light vehicles.” S&P downgraded Ford to junk status and put Toyota on review.The billions of dollars of cash that car companies are sitting on may give investors comfort that contingency plans are in place. But automakers run cash-intensive businesses, paying suppliers and funding operations. Having a cushion helps in tough times, but not for long.
Unlike other cash-heavy enterprises, most also run so-called negative working capital, meaning their current liabilities are higher than current assets. A dollar upfront is better than a dollar in a few weeks. The reason they can do this is because they get paid by their dealers before delivery – especially in the U.S, which is a credit-driven market.
That’s all good when the cars are selling. But when things turn down, these companies start burning through cash quickly, as my colleague Chris Bryant has written. Pre-virus sales outlooks were already poor. The trouble with Covid-19 is that no one knows how long it will last or when buyers will return. That makes it harder to say how much cash they’ll need, part of the reason some are proactively drawing down their credit lines.
In the current gloom, it’s worth looking at how far every dollar of sales goes toward meeting operational expenses and paying down short-term debt, or the ratio of working capital to sales. Companies still have to meet their payables, but inventories aren’t being drained. During the financial crisis a decade ago, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Joel Levington notes the ratio started slightly negative and rose to 5%. If that occurred again, he estimates, an average automaker would need an additional $6.9 billion of capital. With cash needs cropping up across the economy, it’s unclear where that money would come from.
The descent can be quick: At the height of the crisis, Japanese automakers in the U.S. ran negative free cash flows of 830 billion yen ($7.7 billion), according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., dropping from close to positive 2 trillion yen. In China, cash flows are highly correlated to profitability. If you’re running losses, working capital will bite. The cascading effect of a cash crunch could run far and wide. Some large Chinese auto parts manufacturers rely on international automakers for 30% to 50% of their business to generate positive operating cash flow. “This could change quickly,” says Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analyst Alexious Lee.Then there’s the debt coming due. Automakers haven’t piled on large amounts except for their financing arms. But, per Levington, as of last week $179 billion of debt had a 30%-plus chance of default. The convulsions in markets will make it more expensive to pay. The likes of Tata Motors Ltd.-owned Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc have seen their bonds trade down to as low as 59 cents on the dollar.  Across the sector, more than $100 billion matures this year with almost 40% rated below A, he notes.Financing arms, a big source of problems in 2008, have again become major drivers of operating profits. If China is any indication for how quickly things can sour, defaults on auto loan-backed securities rose sharply last month and prepayments fell to a record low.The position of car giants is now reminiscent of the pre-financial crisis years. When Detroit’s automakers were on the verge of collapse, the U.S. government braved public rebuke and stepped in with $82 billion in various forms to avoid the economic pain of collapse. The bailout remains debated, but one thing is clear: Carmakers will need help this time, too. While Washington’s new $2 trillion stimulus could indirectly benefit the sector, prolonged pain would need more support.
Cars may have gotten better since the last crisis, but automakers haven’t readied their balance sheets or operations for one as severe as this is turning out to be."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/how-to-clear-the-hurdles-in-the-run-toward-mortgage-approval/2020/03/26/8256d8e6-53fa-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html,The Washington Post,Understand the loan terms when applying for a mortgage,"No one wants to return to the days when anyone could get a mortgage even if they couldn’t realistically afford the payments.
Yet every few months or so, concern bubbles up again about unconventional loans and the potential for another housing crisis. Tweaks to lender guidelines and new credit scoring models sometimes create consternation among consumers and the lending industry about access to credit becoming too easy or too difficult.
The global coronavirus, which initially dropped mortgage rates to new lows, led to a rush to refinance that overwhelmed lenders. Rates increased when lenders couldn’t handle the volume of loans. Now that the pandemic is impacting the United States, borrowers should anticipate a slowdown in mortgage closings because everyone is working from home and still attempting to process an overload of loan applications.
Generally, mortgage borrowers in 2020 need to do two things: understand the loan they’re applying for and be able to demonstrate their ability to repay it.
“I’m a huge fan of loan preapprovals and I think everyone should get two or three unbiased opinions from lenders about mortgage options before they fall in love with a house,” says Anna DeSimone, author of “Housing Finance 2020: New Mortgage Programs for the New Generation of Homebuyers,” and a housing finance consultant in New York City. “It’s like going on a job interview where you can ask and answer questions.”
Mortgage approvals are generally based on your FICO credit scores, your loan-to-value (which varies according to the size of your down payment and the appraised value of the house) and your debt-to-income ratio. Your debt-to-income ratio is a measure of the minimum payments on your credit card debt, loans and housing payment compared to your gross monthly income. Meeting in person with a lender can help you understand what it takes to qualify for a mortgage.
“If you just complete an online form for a loan, that won’t capture some of the compensating factors that a lender may consider in your favor,” says DeSimone. “For example, an automated system may require a credit score of 680 for a loan with 5 percent down, but if you have a retirement account with six months’ worth of mortgage payments that could allow an approval with a lower credit score.”
DeSimone says mortgage applications today list 20 different types of acceptable income, such as seasonal work, rental income from boarders and part-time jobs — in greater recognition of the reality of the ways people earn money. The income must be documented with bank statements or other paperwork.
“Lenders have different standards and will offer different rates and programs, so there’s no substitute for shopping around for a loan,” says Guy Cecala, chief executive and publisher of Bethesda-based Inside Mortgage Finance Publications. “It’s important to talk to more than one lender and to do it before you’re ready to apply for a loan because the credit score the mortgage lender pulls tends to be more comprehensive than the one you see online. It can be hard to calculate your own debt-to-income ratio because the lender only counts some types of debt.”
The average FICO score for approved mortgage loans has remained relatively steady in recent years, ranging from 723 in 2017 to 731 in 2019, according to Joe Tyrrell, chief operating officer of Ellie Mae, a technology provider for mortgage companies headquartered in Pleasanton, Calif. The average debt-to-income ratio for approved mortgage loans was 39 percent in 2017 and 38 percent in 2019.
“Even though access to home buying has improved with the availability of more low-down-payment loans, lenders are not compromising on the credit quality of applicants,” says Tyrrell.
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans have more lenient requirements than conventional loans, which are purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the government-sponsored entities that operate under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and purchase the majority of mortgage loans made in the United States.
“FHA loans are a great option for people with lower FICO scores,” says Jeremy Sopko, CEO of Nations Lending, headquartered in Independence, Ohio. “The average FICO score for our customers is 680 but we also provide loans to people with credit scores of 580 and below. In that case, though, we expect them to come to the table with their own funds for the down payment. If someone has a low credit score and they’re getting their down payment from their family, then they don’t have any meat into the loan.”
FICO score changes
Fair Isaac Corp., which issues FICO credit scores, recently announced new credit scoring models (FICO 10 and FICO 10T) that will be used by all three credit reporting bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) by the end of the year. FICO scores impact mortgage lending in two ways. First, a low score can disqualify a borrower from many loan programs. Second, the interest rate paid for conventional loans depends on FICO scores. The lowest mortgage rates are reserved for borrowers with a credit score of 760 or above, according to MyFICO.com.
“Mortgage lenders use an older FICO scoring model rather than the most recent model, so the impact of the new scoring model isn’t likely to be felt right away,” says Tyrrell. “But the new FICO 10T version could have an impact on future borrowing because it looks at trended data rather than a snapshot of what a borrower looks like right now.”
Trended data examines the pattern of debt repayment over two years. Consumers who pay credit card bills in full each month are likely to see a boost in their credit score, while those who carry a balance or pay off their debt and then accrue more debt are likely to see a drop in their credit score with the new model, according to Tyrrell.
“Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a mandate to change credit score models, but the process is just beginning,” says Ed Pinto, director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Housing Center in Washington, D.C. “They have three years to make the change and a two-year implementation period, so FICO can come out with anything they want but there will be a delay on the mortgage end.”
Much of the blame for the 2008 financial crisis fell on unusual mortgages, such as “choose-your-own-payment” and no-income verification loans, also known as “liar’s loans.” While those types of loans are not widely available, in 2019 unconventional loans represented $52 billion in loan volume, the highest level since the housing crisis, says Cecala. However, that’s still a relatively small number — less than 3 percent of the overall mortgage volume for the year.
Today’s unconventional loans include those that rely on bank statements instead of tax returns to verify income and asset-based loans for high-net-worth families, says Tyrell, but they’re not readily available to most borrowers.
“Before the housing crisis, more than a third of all loans were unconventional and they were offered by all lenders as part of their product mix,” says Cecala. “Now most lenders are doing a good job underwriting the loans, especially because there’s so little investor interest in these loans that the lenders hold them themselves. That imposes discipline because the lenders don’t want to lose money. For instance, you do see some interest-only loans, but they’re typically only approved for well-heeled buyers with high incomes and high credit scores.”
One measure of the state of mortgage lending is delinquencies, which refer to loans with payments that are 30 days or more past due. In January 2020, mortgage delinquencies hit their lowest level on record, dating back to 2000, according to Black Knight, a software and data analytics provider. The number of loans with late payments declined 14 percent in January 2020 compared with January 2019, an indication of both a strong economy and high standards for loan approvals.
“Today’s unconventional loans aren’t as risky as in the early 2000s because lenders are more careful now and won’t loan 100 percent of the value of the home to someone based on their bank statements,” says Sopko. “Now you’ll need a down payment or home equity of 30 or 40 percent for those kinds of loans.”
Changes in 2021
The existence of fewer risky mortgages today stems from post-crisis regulations as well as lender skittishness over the massive losses they incurred during the housing crisis. One part of those regulations protects borrowers from predatory lending and provides safety for lenders from lawsuits as long as they follow the rules for a “qualified mortgage” or “QM” loan. QM loans meet a long list of requirements, such as no balloon payments, no interest-only periods and set a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 43 percent.
However, loans that would be purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are exempt from the maximum debt-to-income ratio of 43 percent set by the QM rule — if borrowers met all other requirements to demonstrate their ability to repay the loan. That exemption is scheduled to be lifted in January 2021.
“That 43 percent was set because it’s basically the mortgage standard without any compensating factors, but if you had good income and good reserves or a down payment of 50 percent, a ratio higher than 43 percent might be okay,” says Cecala.
The possibility of this exemption, known as the “QM patch,” expiring without modification by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unlikely, according to Cecala and most industry experts. The concern, says Cecala, is that fewer borrowers would qualify if the maximum debt-to-income ratio of 43 percent was enforced for conventional loans.
On the other hand, some observers worry the CFPB could get rid of the debt-to-income ratio requirement.
“If the debt-to-income ratio requirement is eliminated, then lenders are less likely to manage risk,” says Pinto. “My concern is that too-easy credit could return.”
Another possible outcome if the QM patch is lifted next year would be an increased number of private non-QM loans, says Sopko, which could be risky.
Changes to loan regulations, new FICO scoring models and the return of unconventional loans are all something to keep an eye on over the next year or two, says Sopko. In the meantime, mortgage borrowers should be sure they understand their credit and finances before they begin to look for a home.
Some advice for borrowers applies no matter what happens in the mortgage industry, such as:
● Check your credit report. Get your free credit reports from each of the credit bureaus at www.annualcreditreport.com to look for errors. You can also pay for a credit score at that time or get a free credit score from your bank or credit card company, but keep in mind that score is likely to be different from the score a lender will see.
● Prepare your documents. Many loan applications are handled online with secure portals where you can upload your documents. You’ll need to know how to access your most recent paystubs, tax returns and statements for all your bank and investment accounts. If you’re self-employed or rely on alimony or child support for income, you’ll need additional documentation.
● Check for down payment assistance programs. You can check with your state or local government or with DownPaymentResource.com. DeSimone says there are programs for people with incomes higher than $100,000 in 43 states. “Not checking for home buyer programs is like accepting a college admission without asking about financial aid,” she says.
● Shop for loan information. Take a copy of your annual credit report and credit score to several lenders so they can get a general idea of your credit profile and your loan options without requesting a credit report, recommends DeSimone. If you appear to be applying for multiple loans, that can damage your credit score, so wait to apply until you’re ready to seriously shop for a home.
● Explore all your loan options. Borrowers who are low on cash have a variety of loans available, including some with zero down payment required (such as VA loans for veterans and USDA loans for buyers in rural areas) and low down payment loans from FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Many financial institutions have special loan programs for first-time buyers and repeat buyers.
Avoid overextending your budget. Pinto says he worries that weaker buyers could be in danger if a recession hits, particularly since the United States is in the ninth year of a boom cycle. “Don’t stretch to buy,” says Pinto. “Try to stay within your budget to reduce your exposure to debt or come up with a bigger down payment so you have more equity."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-the-stock-buyback-bazooka-has-been-silenced-by-virus/2020/03/26/a43a4154-6f1c-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html,The Washington Post,How the Stock Buyback Bazooka Has Been Silenced by Virus,"The effort to shore up U.S. businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic has brought new attention to the single biggest investment most big companies have made over the past decade: their own stock. The defenders of share buybacks say it’s often the most efficient use of capital. Critics say it has left firms vulnerable to the kind of shock the virus has produced. Either way, it’s been a vital support for equities -- but one that will probably be sharply curtailed for a while, for both economic and political reasons.
1. How big have buybacks been?
The past two years have been the busiest on record, according to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Companies flush with cash from a 2017 tax cut bought back a record $806 billion of shares in 2018, a figure that slipped to $729 billion in 2019. For members of the S&P 500 Index, buybacks have exceeded dividends in every quarter since 2010.
2. What’s happening now?
Buybacks started to slow in the beginning of the year, with U.S. repurchases totaling $122 billion in January and February, down 46% from a year earlier, according to the report. This slowdown -- which coincided with a peaking stock market -- gathered pace in recent weeks as a growing number of companies across the world suspended the practice to conserve cash. The S&P report described second-quarter prospects as “dismal” and said buybacks may be slow to come back due to potential government restrictions as well as public-image concerns.
3. Who’s pulling back?
Eight giant U.S. banks responsible for some of the largest buybacks globally in the past year, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., agreed to stop buying back their own shares through the second quarter. The banks had planned to spend a combined $119 billion in the four quarters after the Federal Reserve’s stress tests last June. Among Europe’s most prolific buyers of its own shares, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, canceled the next tranche of its $25 billion buyback program. For whatever reason, cutting off buybacks removes one more prop of a shaky equities market. And not just in the U.S.: Barclays Plc strategists wrote in a note to clients on March 25 that European equities are losing support from buybacks, which “acted as a crucial backstop during periods of rising market volatility last year.”
4. What do buybacks have to do with stimulus packages?
In short, it’s the horrible optics of a company using money from the government to enrich shareholders. Buybacks have been denounced by both the right and the left. President Donald Trump said earlier this month he was unhappy with companies that used money saved from his 2017 tax cut to buy back shares rather than build domestic factories. A repeat of this would go against the intention of any bailouts, which is to support workers, he said. Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pushed to include a permanent ban on buybacks as a condition for government aid. She and others noted that the five biggest U.S. airlines -- prime targets for government bailout funds -- spent 96% of their free cash flow on repurchases over the past decade.
5. What was decided?
A bipartisan bill agreed to in the Senate included a requirement that any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. Those companies also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers.
6. How did buybacks get so big?
Against the backdrop of President Ronald Reagan’s deregulatory drive in the 1980s, restrictions on buybacks were loosened, executives were granted a safe harbor from stock-price manipulation charges and a culture of “shareholder value” was born. A wave of hostile takeovers made sitting on a pile of cash seem dangerous. And managers’ bonuses were increasingly tied to stock performance, to align their incentives with those of shareholders. The result? Buybacks boomed, often paid for with increased borrowing.
7. Companies borrowed to buy stock?
Yes. In the Reagan-era worldview, this was good: Tax breaks made debt a cheaper form of financing, and the need to make regular interest payments could focus executives’ minds on generating more cash. Over the next few decades, the stock market’s perceived function -- raising money for business ventures -- was turned on its head, as stocks became a vehicle largely for returning money to shareholders. Any gain in the share price caused by a buyback goes untaxed as long as the shares aren’t sold, and capital gains are also usually taxed at lower rates than dividends.
8. What’s the benefit of buybacks beyond making shareholders richer?
Proponents argue that if managers can’t see a better opportunity for profitable investment, perhaps there isn’t one. Buybacks are thus seen as a good vehicle to get funds out of the hands of executives who might otherwise waste them on pet projects and speculative investments.
9. What are the arguments against?
Some critics, including Warren and U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, argue that buybacks are great for shareholders but bad for employees, harming the long-term growth of the economy and exacerbating inequality. A different line of criticism says that the widespread use of buybacks isn’t good for shareholders either. With the majority of senior executive compensation tied to company stock, managers often take advantage of the pop that a stock price gets when a buyback is announced to sell some of the shares they’ve received through grants or options. Record-low interest rates make it easier to pile on debt for this purpose, which can prove detrimental in a crisis when cash flows dry up.
10. Is this an issue elsewhere?
While the U.S. leads the way in both the amount of buybacks and the intensity of political scrutiny, the practice isn’t unknown in Europe or Asia. In Japan, electronics powerhouse Sony Corp. announced a 100 billion yen ($900 million) buyback last year -- its first-ever major repurchase -- followed by another one twice as large just months after. The European Central Bank said earlier this month that it expects banks to take “prudent decisions” after unveiling support measures, while Germany’s financial watchdog Bafin said that lenders should avoid buybacks."

If we don’t pay attention, its cure will speed them up.","SOME MIGHT take this news as a silver lining to an otherwise dark time: Harmful climate-affecting emissions are way down in China, Italy and elsewhere as social isolation measures keep people at home. Declines in driving, flying, manufacturing and other economic activity account for the drop.
As with the decline in global emissions due to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, this is not progress. Once covid-19 is conquered and people return to work, emissions will rise again, absent new policy. More to the point: Addressing global warming cannot depend on economic hardship. Governments must manage the transition off fossil fuels so it occurs steadily and with minimal disruption.
Scientists continue to offer nothing but warnings. Even as the novel coronavirus spread, the United Nations announced this month that 2019 was the second-warmest year on record. El Niño, a natural cycle, boosted temperatures in 2016 — still officially the warmest year — and was largely absent in 2019. But the background on which El Niño and other natural phenomena occur is getting ever warmer. Last year would have been the warmest if it had seen a strong El Niño. Future El Niño years will no doubt break the record.
The long-term trend is key. “The past five years are the five warmest on record, and the past decade, 2010–2019, is also the warmest on record,” the United Nations found. “Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding one since 1850.”
Devastating effects already have arrived. “In 2019, heatwaves, combined with long periods of drought, were linked to wildfires of unprecedented size. This was the case in Australia, where millions of hectares were set ablaze, and in Siberia and other Arctic regions hit by wildfires of record intensity,” Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, said.
But things can get much worse. A study published this month in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that areas currently home to 1.2 billion people will see extreme heat and humidity — enough to induce dangerous heat stress in humans — every year by 2100. New York, for example, would see about 24 days of extreme heat and humidity annually. That is if world governments limit warming to only 3 degrees Celsius, as their current path suggests. At 2 degrees, places that are home to 800 million people would see these punishing conditions yearly, and at 1.5, the number would be 500 million people.
As governments move from crisis to recovery, hardship will leave them less inclined than ever to grapple with climate change. But they should take recovery as an opportunity to emphasize sustainability. Covid-19 is the disaster of now. Climate change will be the disaster that defines younger generations’ lives. It will unfold over the coming decades, it will be pervasive, and it will be deadly, too."

That this is actually true is a measure of how much the gulf between the parties has increased. That it seems far truer today is a measure of how much the Trump presidency and the coronavirus pandemic have raised the stakes.
But what exactly are those stakes — in the 2020 election, and in the battle within the Democratic Party that has now tilted in Joe Biden’s favor? To answer that question, I did something unusual in this age of 24/7 commentary. I got off Twitter and read some books. More precisely, I read as many recent works as I could by respected political analysts who are trying to grapple with the transformation of our politics and the Democratic Party. (Not surprisingly, given my interest in the latter, these analysts are mostly on the left.)
In these well-timed tomes, I found support for three fundamental conclusions. The first is that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Far from breaking with the past, the Trump presidency has accelerated the intensified polarization of the past generation. Indeed, according to Ganesh Sitaraman, in his ambitious “The Great Democracy,” released late last year, Trump’s turbocharging of Republicans’ reactionary turn has set America up for that rarest of transformations: the potential end of one “political regime” and its replacement with another.
The idea comes from my Yale colleague Stephen Skowronek. His influential 1993 book, “The Politics Presidents Make,” argued that presidents’ capacity to reshape American politics depends on the place of those leaders within the ebb and flow of regnant political regimes — the ideas and commitments associated with an ascendant governing vision. Franklin D. Roosevelt capitalized on the collapse of the Republican framework associated with big business and laissez-faire under the discredited Herbert Hoover; Ronald Reagan took advantage of Jimmy Carter’s efforts to salvage FDR’s pro-government coalition and remade the GOP.
In recent writings, Skowronek has argued that Trump is a latter-day Carter, a president who effectively killed off his own party’s program by taking it to its logical extreme. Sitaraman picks up this thread and argues that we are seeing the end of the regime associated with Reagan, sometimes called “neoliberalism,” and the emergence of another.
The collapse of this regime seemed probable before the pandemic; now, it looks all but inevitable. Though still trying to serve their corporate backers, Republicans have embraced government spending on a scale never before seen outside of wartime.
If there are no atheists in foxholes, there are no libertarians — or even neoliberals — in a pandemic. Just as wars and depressions forge new political orders, the combination of covid-19 and the ongoing eclipse of Reagan’s GOP virtually guarantees a fundamental shift, regardless of how — and it’s not too alarmist to add whether — the election plays out.
What that new regime will be, however, is not yet clear, Sitaraman argues. One frightening possibility he raises in his provocative book is a “nationalist oligarchy,” Trumpism freed from its enfeebled constitutional constraints. Another, the one Sitaraman advocates, is a renewed commitment to democracy in our economy as well as our politics — a solidaristic turn that covid-19 could, in theory, make more likely. Sitaraman is a longtime adviser to Elizabeth Warren, and so it comes as no surprise that his book is admirably detailed about the reforms he believes are needed.
And that he says we need a lot of reforms: not only to reinforce institutions that encourage greater solidarity across lines of race and class (Sitaraman’s slogan for these proposals is “united democracy”), but also to curb growing concentrations of economic power while reducing inequalities across people and regions (“economic democracy”), to make our electoral system more representative and our national political institutions more responsive (“political democracy”), and to design a foreign policy based on the promotion and protection of American democratic values (“defending democracy”).
Many of these ideas are innovative and would probably be effective. Sitaraman makes a strong argument, for example, that the Supreme Court should be replaced with one in which a randomly chosen selection of circuit court judges hears cases for a limited period, with a supermajority required to overturn congressional legislation. I came away from his book with the same exciting sense of possibility that I felt every time I reviewed Warren’s campaign website.
Alas, I had the same creeping fear of futility, too. The rub — not just with Warren’s agenda but also with Bernie Sanders’s even more costly (and much less fiscally forthcoming) blueprints — is how to prioritize and implement a set of individually appealing but collectively daunting proposals. After more than 200 pages, Sitaraman basically throws up his hands and provides bullet points (“Second: Find Leaders with Courage”). That someone so thoughtful must retreat to such hortation suggests just how formidable the political barriers are that stand between our current toxic politics and a “Great Democracy.”
Which brings us to the second big conclusion: The battle over what will replace neoliberalism is not just a clash of worldviews but of regionally based coalitions: an alliance of nonurban voters and conservative economic elites, vs. one of urban and nonwhite voters and progressive elements of the plutocracy. One is backward looking (“Make America Great Again”); one, generally forward looking (though Biden’s “Our Best Days Still Lie Ahead” is belied by his overwhelming nostalgia for the Obama presidency and for the Senate bipartisanship only he seems to think can be quickly revived).
As Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, explains in “Un-Trumping America,” the backward-looking GOP is greatly advantaged by our constitutional system. Our electoral institutions reward regionally dispersed voters, who have outsize clout because of Senate malapportionment and the ease of drawing electoral boundaries that crowd urban Democrats into a small number of districts. Our governing institutions provide ample openings for political elites willing to compromise democracy through vote-rigging, anti-democratic maneuvers and capitulation to an authoritarian-minded president.
Pfeiffer is hardly the first to point out how America’s distinctive institutions advantage the GOP. Focusing on Congress, Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein made this point almost a decade ago in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” and it’s a key claim of my work with Paul Pierson. Still, it’s an important reminder that institutions typically trump personalities (so to speak) when it comes to big shifts in our democracy.
Where Sitaraman is long on policy and short on strategy, Pfeiffer is a fount of advice. George W. Bush’s advisers were once dismissed as “Mayberry Machiavellis” — cutthroat operatives with small-town sensibilities (Trump’s advisers make “Mayberry” look like a metropolis). Pfeiffer’s alliterative approach might be Reluctant Realpolitik. A former bridge-builder, he now recognizes that outreach to the current GOP is a bridge to nowhere. Pfeiffer’s best-selling “Yes We (Still) Can” was nostalgic about his ex-boss. “Un-Trumping America” is much more clear-eyed about the limits as well as the appeal of the Obama vision.
Notably (because it’s so important yet so rarely discussed), Pfeiffer understands how much the Democratic Party has lost because of the decline of organized labor. While Democrats’ top leaders have temporized and triangulated, Republican leaders and business groups, and billionaire organization-builders like Charles and David Koch, have invested aggressively in killing unions off. The fallout — not just for the security and standing of ordinary workers, but also for the financial and electoral base of the Democratic Party — has been devastating.
“The biggest divide in the Democratic Party,” Pfeiffer observes, “is not between left and center. It’s between those who believe once Trump is gone things will go back to normal, and those who believe that our democracy is under a threat that goes beyond Trump.” Once hopeful that “the fever may break” within the GOP (as his former boss put it), Pfeiffer is now squarely in the “democracy under threat” camp. Yet the candidate who is claiming the Obama mantle, Biden, seems inclined toward the go-back-to-normal diagnosis. In other words, serious questions remain about whether Pfeiffer’s — to my mind, insufficient — alarm will drive the party going forward.
A revealing story in “Un-Trumping America” illustrates the problem. At a meeting with a bunch of Silicon Valley billionaires bemoaning the state of the Democratic Party, Pfeiffer passionately makes the case for putting big money into rebuilding the party. The billionaires recoil. They don’t want to become “a liberal version of the Koch organization,” as one puts it.
No doubt these super-rich donors will invest in electing a Democrat in 2020, at least if that Democrat is not Sanders. But their response shows just how under-resourced the reformers are compared with those defending the GOP and its plutocratic achievements. It also suggests that, on top of the aforementioned institutional biases, the Democratic Party is disadvantaged by the reluctance of its political elites to fight fire with fire and of party-aligned economic elites to embrace more aggressive redistribution that would have broad popular appeal.
We thus arrive at the third and final conclusion: The future of American politics rests on the ability of the Democratic Party to forge a governing agenda that harmonizes rather than papers over the profound differences among its factions. As E.J. Dionne argues in his timely “Code Red: How Progressives and Moderates Can Unite to Save Our Country,” Democrats cannot construct a new political regime unless they grapple with the fundamental internal divide that continues to cleave their party.
If Republicans have fused white working-class appeals and plutocratic policy priorities into a racially monochromatic party of reaction, Democrats are an increasingly multiracial party that extends from the far left to the center-right. Republicans have abandoned even the pretense of racial reconciliation, making increasingly explicit appeals to white identity politics while doubling down on their long-standing governing agenda of upward redistribution. Democrats have embraced multiracialism, but important elements of the party still cling to neoliberalism.
The Trump presidency has galvanized Democrats. Yet it has also brought out the simmering rage on both sides of the party’s internal divide — a divide that Dionne rightly describes as between moderates who fear overreach and progressives who fear capitulation. As Pfieffer points out, the cleavage is as much about how to rebuild American democracy as about how to rebuild the party. It’s also at least as much about how to understand the Obama presidency as how to explain Democrats’ loss in 2016. By way of illustration, Sitaraman’s mild critiques of the Obama record brought him rebukes from fellow Democrats who think Obama’s achievements (and the obstacles he faced) aren’t appreciated by the Democratic left.
The irony is that the Democrats’ coalition — more unruly, less uniform and currently more divided — is ultimately the most likely to prevail, so long as American democracy remains vibrant. The Republicans’ key strengths, particularly their reliance on older white voters and their unbreakable alliance with organized money, are also their key weaknesses. The Democrats’ key weaknesses, particularly their appeal to younger and nonwhite voters and the basic popularity of their commitments, are also their key strengths.
The question all these analysts confront is one that still vexes me after reading their books, especially now that the stakes of governance are so clear and so high: Are the Democrats’ inherent advantages enough to save American politics?"

Nonetheless, there are lessons from the 2008 rescue package, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (known as TARP) that may help as officials work to turn Congress’s $2 trillion relief package into actual assistance for ordinary Americans and Main Street businesses nationwide.
I oversaw TARP during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, and my experience underscores that if there is a principle policymakers need to keep in mind going forward, it’s this: Err on the side of helping as many workers and businesses as possible rather than on prudence. This is not the time to worry about moral hazard or whether people are incentivized not to work. When the covid-19 crisis is behind us, if our biggest complaint is that some workers and small businesses got help when they didn’t really need it, that would be a wonderful outcome for our country.
In terms of next steps, other lessons include:
Policymakers will need to be nimble and adjust to rapidly changing conditions. When we negotiated the $700 billion TARP, our focus had been on buying troubled mortgages from banks. Within days of Congress approving the program, financial conditions rapidly deteriorated and we were forced to pivot. Buying thousands of mortgages would have taken longer than the financial system could endure. So, instead, we immediately injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the largest banks to stabilize the system. Our change created confusion and anger; members of Congress and the public felt like we had promised one thing but did another. Their criticism was fair, but the pivot was necessary to prevent a total financial collapse. Today, the support our health-care system, businesses and families need is likely to evolve. Policymakers should not hesitate to change tactics if necessary.
Next, time is of the essence. Policymakers should not conserve the resources Congress is authorizing; they should deploy them as quickly as possible. In 2008, there was great anger across the country because banks had taken risks and Main Street bore the consequences. We were careful to conserve the TARP authority because we knew that if we used it up, there would be little political will to do more. Today, people intuitively understand that the covid-19 crisis is essentially a natural disaster; businesses and workers weren’t taking foolish risks. Policymakers should use the full authority Congress grants to immediately make sure that states have the health-care resources and equipment they need, that businesses have the wherewithal to preserve their staffs, and that individuals and families can make ends meet until the virus is contained. The highest priorities must be to enable the health-care system to catch up and control the spread of the virus — and to maximize the number of jobs saved. It is far better to spend taxpayer money to help small businesses retain their workers than to spend the same money helping workers after they’ve been laid off. If this health emergency lasts longer than these resources can bridge, Congress has shown it will do what is necessary to support the American people.
Finally, policymakers should learn from perhaps the biggest mistake we made in 2008: We targeted our programs too narrowly, and they ended up being less effective than the country needed. Being prudent stewards of taxpayer resources is, of course, always important, but when a crisis is raging, the speed and scale of interventions are paramount. Congress and the Bush and Obama administrations enacted multiple programs to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. None of them was highly effective because they were all targeted to homeowners who needed only a little help. Americans were angry at the thought of their “irresponsible” neighbors getting a bailout. By applying numerous criteria to make sure only “deserving” families received help, we narrowed and slowed the programs dramatically, resulting in a deeper housing correction, with more foreclosures than had we flooded borrowers with assistance. The American people ultimately paid more because of our attempts to save them money.
What does this mean today? Think of firefighters putting out a fire. If their primary aim is to conserve water, they increase the odds of losing control of the fire.
The $2 trillion legislation includes many provisions to help both businesses large and small and the millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. As implementation begins, officials will be tempted to develop complex rules to decide who will qualify. For example, if each of the thousands of struggling small businesses needs to be individually vetted, the program is likely to be too slow to meaningfully help the economy. While the U.S. economy can bounce back from a crisis fairly quickly, it took more than 10 years after the 2008 crisis to rebuild the labor market. We can’t let that happen again. Let’s learn from history and douse the raging fire — before it becomes uncontrollable."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/03/27/federal-student-loans-coronavirus/,The Washington Post,"Worried about your student loans? Here’s what the government is, and is not, doing to help.","Between the congressional spending package and the Trump administration’s recent orders, there are a few avenues for student loan borrowers seeking relief as the financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak takes hold.
There is disagreement as to whether these measures go far enough, especially since the economic fallout from the pandemic may last for months, if not years. Still, what relief the federal government is offering could prove beneficial.
Here’s what it all means for the 43 million Americans holding $1.5 trillion in federal student loans.
No payments and no interest
The Trump administration gave federal student loan borrowers the option last week of postponing payments for at least 60 days, while automatically suspending the bills of those in delinquency. Even if people choose to continue making payments, the Education Department would still waive interest on their loans for at least two months.
This week, Congress agreed to extend the timeline through Sept. 30 and made the suspension automatic. For those six months, borrowers can postpone their payments without penalty or interest accruing. What’s more, each month would still count toward loan forgiveness for borrowers in public service jobs. It would also count toward student loan rehabilitation, a federal program that erases a default from a person’s credit report after nine consecutive payments.
While this plan could help 95 percent of borrowers with federal loans, it excludes those with federal debt held by private companies. That debt is from the old bank-based Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program that ended in 2010 when the Obama administration moved strictly to direct lending. The plan also excludes federal Perkins loans for low-income students that are held by colleges and universities.
People with bank-based federal loans that are not held by the government can consolidate their debt to take advantage of the waiver and payment suspension. But that process could take some time, and unpaid interest will be added to their balance.
Halt to defaults and return of funds
The Education Department has stopped all requests to the U.S. Treasury Department to seize the tax refunds, paychecks and Social Security benefits of people in default on their federal student loans.
The department will hold off on transferring new accounts to its private debt collectors for at least 60 days from March 13. Those companies must stop calling borrowers, issuing notices or billing statements. You can, however, reach out to inquire about your debt.
Congress codified the reprieve in the spending bill and extended it through Sept. 30, but it applies only to student loans held by the federal government. People in default on commercially held bank-based federal loans could still have a portion of their paycheck, disability income or entire tax refund seized by the government.
The Education Department is returning about $1.8 billion to more than 830,000 defaulted borrowers whose money was withheld on or after March 13, the day President Trump declared a national emergency. If you filed your taxes early and had your refund seized before the 13th, the money will not be returned. And the refund is available only to people with debt within the federal government’s student loan portfolio.
Debt cancellation and repayment
Despite all of the excitement over congressional Democrats’ proposals to cancel $10,000 or $30,000 in student debt, the plans failed to gain bipartisan support.
Liberal lawmakers said debt forgiveness would have been a boon for the most distressed borrowers, as most people in default owe less than $10,000. Republicans argued the proposals were unfair to people who did not attend college or who have repaid their student loans.
Nevertheless, lawmakers agreed to a temporary tax break for companies who help their employees pay down their student debt. Student loan assistance has become a popular recruitment tool for start-ups and large firms, who have lobbied Capitol Hill to support the perk through the tax code.
Now, companies will get a tax break for providing employees up to $5,250 a year to repay education debt. Critics of this tax break say it does nothing to help struggling borrowers who have lost their jobs or low-wage workers without access to the benefit. Proponents of student loan assistance programs say the tax break will encourage other companies to offer the benefit.
No federal action on private loans
The federal government holds the vast majority of student loans, but there are still millions of people with education loans from banks and other financial companies. There is no relief for them in the congressional package.
A few private lenders are offering assistance during the outbreak. Discover Financial is allowing some borrowers to extend their payments or postpone them without accruing interest for two months. Citizens Bank is waiving late fees and offering forbearance for three months. Sallie Mae is offering a three-month suspension of payments, while Wells Fargo is providing a 90-day payment deferral.
It is best to contact your lender to discuss your situation, as each company has its own assistance programs and rules for whether you qualify for relief."

No One Knows,"The stimulus plan to protect the U.S. economy from the ravages of Covid-19 unlocks hundreds of billions of dollars for smallbusinesses -- yet the system set to distribute the money is already overwhelmed.
The agency that will oversee the unprecedented $350 billion loan program has been challenged to even maintain a much smaller, existing program, with its website crashing repeatedly. The network of 800 approved lenders expected to divvy up funding have received little guidance so far. It’s unclear, for instance, whether a business owner could apply online or would have to meet with the lender in person.
“There’s a lot we still don’t know,” said Karen Harned, executive director of the Small Business Legal Center at the National Federation of Independent Business, the largest small-business association in the country. Unknowns include: how long it will take for companies to get checks.
That leaves Katalina Mayorga in limbo at a time when she needs financial assistance.
Her El Camino Travel based in Washington, D.C., is losing about $300,000 in revenue this year after three months of canceled trips and refunds.
She tried applying for existing disaster loans from the Small Business Administration more than a week ago and hasn’t heard back. She emailed to follow up and received a message that the inbox was full. She joined a call Wednesday afternoon that her industry association put together with an SBA representative. It was cut short when too many people joined, crashing the line.“It was just craziness, honestly, the last few weeks,” said Mayorga, whose travel agency creates custom vacations for about $3,000 and has largely ground to a halt amid shutdowns to try to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
Shoring up the roughly 30 million small- and medium-size businesses in the U.S. is a key element of the $2 trillion stimulus package. These businesses employ about half of the private workforce and accounted for two-thirds of net employment gains in recent years. Their financial distress has contributed to a record 3.28 million Americans filing for unemployment last week.
The legislation is waiving some paperwork requirements to speed up the loans, and the government has signaled urgency. “By the end of next week we want all the banks to be able to originate loans same day,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.
Herculean Effort
Doling out $350 billion in loans will require a herculean effort -- the sum is more than 10 times the amount the SBA has ever distributed in a year, said Kurt Chilcott, chief executive of San Diego-based SBA lender CDC Small Business Finance.
The agency is expected to issue guidance on how lenders move forward within a week of the president signing it, according to Chilcott and Stephen Keen, who handles congressional relations for the Independent Community Bankers of America.
Among major question marks: how the secondary market would work if banks want to sell off the loans to others; whether the federal government would have to purchase some of the notes itself; and which financial technology lenders can participate.
Bill Koontz, an SBA spokesman, said the agency is scrambling to keep up with demand for its existing disaster loan program to help businesses, even as its site has been down repeatedly because of the high demand. He declined to comment on pending legislation until it gets passed.
“They have at least promised a very expedited process,” said Sandy Baruah, a former SBA administrator who helped steer the agency’s response to the 2008 financial crisis. “If they’re able to deliver on that promise, I think it could have a real positive impact on mitigating the economic damage and the individual damage to small businesses, and those who work for them.”
There are two major programs in the bill targeted at mom-and-pop shops: one is $10 billion for grants of as much as $10,000 per business to cover expenses. The government would advance the money within three days to businesses applying for an SBA disaster loan.
The $350 billion SBA loan program provides a lot more -- up to $10 million per firm -- and companies can get the debt written off under certain conditions, such as retaining employees and keeping salaries above a certain level, and rehiring those already let go.
Jobs at Risk
On the ground, small businesses may be reluctant to take on debt at a time when the pandemic is still surging and tens of millions of Americans are under lockdown orders. Borrowing a chunk of money without knowing when -- if ever -- their business will again turn a profit is too big a risk for many owners and they may instead opt to close, said Amanda Ballantyne, national director for small business lobby group The Main Street Alliance.
Her group estimates that 84.2 million jobs are at risk of being lost amid business closures and bankruptcy.
Peter Gaetano owns a barbershop in Carmel, a town of about 30,000 in New York state. Despite operating through previous recessions, the doors shut indefinitely Saturday night when the state ordered non-essential stores closed. He says he had to let his three staff go.
“I have no answers for what I’m going to do,” said Gaetano, 41, who has two young kids. The family relies on the roughly $60,000 a year he makes for the mortgage payments and other bills.
“I have a little bit of money saved,” he said. “But if this lasts three months, then I’ll be in trouble.”"

South Africa is the only African country to have tested extensively, administering more than 20,000 tests since the first case, and the growing number of positive results put pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa to enact strict measures to limit movement and gatherings.
The country’s Health Ministry on Friday revised the number of coronavirus-related deaths from two to one, saying one of the deaths could not be attributed to the virus.
In a speech earlier this week that was widely lauded for its clarity and conviction, Ramaphosa announced the impending lockdown, during which people will be allowed to leave home only to buy food, seek care, collect welfare grants or take walks by themselves. Running, dog-walking and even the purchase of cigarettes and alcohol have been banned.
On Thursday, Ramaphosa addressed the nation again, this time wearing army fatigues, a symbolic gesture never made before by the former business executive. Army and police personnel were deployed across the country to enforce the lockdown, but he urged them to be a “force of kindness” in a country that is still recovering from the trauma of decades of military-enforced apartheid that ended in 1994.
Their mission is the “most important in the history of our country,” he said. “Our people are terrified right now, and we should not do anything to make their situation worse.”
South Africa is one of the world’s most unequal countries. Gleaming, glassy business districts and suburbs pocked with swimming pools contrast sharply with enormous, densely packed “townships” and hardscrabble rural areas where the majority of the population lives. Pictures circulating in local media show long lines at supermarkets in numerous townships.
Mismanagement has hobbled the country’s state-run water and electricity companies, leaving many residents worried they could be marooned at home without essential services during the lockdown. South Africa was already in a recession, suffering from chronic unemployment that affects about a third of the working population, as well as widespread underemployment in an economy that is at least 50 percent informal — or off the books.
“First, I am out of work, so no money,” said Hector Manyike, a taxi driver in Johannesburg, South Africa’s biggest city. “And then I stay at home ,and we don’t know what will happen in three weeks. The virus may go everywhere. People are scared. It is very, very, very difficult, my brother.”
The majority of South Africa’s cases are in its most-populated provinces, which include the major cities of Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban and Cape Town.
South Africa’s lockdown is one of the strictest in the world and could presage similar measures in other African countries. Neighboring Botswana’s president told citizens there to prepare for such an announcement soon. Rwanda is already in lockdown; Uganda has banned public transport; Eritrea has closed most public institutions; Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, has banned travel between states.
On Friday, Kenya was scheduled to begin an indefinite nighttime curfew, which has been criticized for potentially creating more situations in which crowds will form. Kinshasa, the capital of Congo and one of Africa’s largest cities, with at least 14 million people, will initiate a four-day-on, two-day-off lockdown cycle starting Saturday.
Two dozen African countries have fully closed their borders, and 10 more have closed their airports to international traffic."

How serendipitous that the last time the federal gasoline tax rose (in 1993), the average price of gasoline was $1.11 a gallon, an inflation-adjusted $1.98. The 18.4-cents-a-gallon tax has been stuck in neutral ever since. Any chance Congress will have the courage to double the tax immediately to fund a massive infrastructure program to rebuild roads and bridges and airports?
Imagine what that could do to put people to work, counter the coronavirus’s gut punch to the economy and, surprise, not leave the bill for our grandchildren. (And still leave drivers paying less at the pump than just a few weeks ago; provisions could be made to compensate low-income Americans.) And, if higher prices enticed more commuters to use public transit, it would help counter the damage to those systems."

Confusion and want are so massive that they’ve been willing to work with sellers they don’t know, even paying upfront for the equipment they need. The threat of fraud is everywhere: A recent delivery of 500,000 surgical masks from a Chinese supplier turned out to be medically useless. They appeared designed for a nail salon.
“We’re burning through cash, but there’s no other option,” the network’s chief medical and quality officer, John Bonamo, told The Washington Post. “The rules as we know them don’t exist anymore.”
This “otherworldly atmosphere,” as Bonamo calls it, is driving demands from governors and local health officials for the federal government to take control of the distribution of scarce medical resources nationwide.
They’ve pleaded for the White House to invoke the Defense Production Act, the legislation that would compel American companies to make critical supplies. President Trump has refused. “I just haven’t had to use it,” Trump said Thursday night.
But late Friday afternoon, Trump reversed his stance, invoking the act to order General Motors to make ventilators and arguing the company had been “wasting time.” ""Our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,” he said in a statement.
The federal move follows weeks of anguish and confusion over supply shortages, according to hospital purchasing managers, state emergency management officers and even the middlemen themselves. In interviews, they portrayed a broadly dysfunctional system across the United States, with hospitals and health authorities having few options but to rely on largely unknown middlemen whose priority appears to be making a profit as they promise to quickly replenish the nation’s depleted medical stockpiles.
The companies exist outside the traditional medical supply chain and offer wildly varying levels of price and quality, leaving hospitals with limited recourse when deliveries go wrong. The frenzy is helping drive up costs and forcing already strained hospital leaders to vet suppliers for dangerous counterfeits and scams.
Without clear federal coordination, states and hospital groups said they were having to grapple with suppliers eager to secure sales and squeeze profits from companies spending billions of dollars to combat the viral spread.
The governors of New York, Texas, Illinois and other states have said they are competing with the federal government and other states in a mad scramble for lifesaving supplies such as surgical masks, N95 respirators, isolation gowns and ventilators that are widely drained or out of stock.
They are also dealing with a frenzy of pitches from unknown suppliers offering to sell them the materials directly from Chinese factories. Christian Mitchell, deputy governor of Illinois, said he’s on a team of more than a dozen staffers attempting to sort through a dizzying array of sellers offering masks and medical equipment.
“You’ll have a friend of a friend of a guy who has a friend of a cousin who maybe does business in China, and you have to make sure: Is this person legitimate?” Mitchell said in an interview. “Can they give you pictures, or can they actually send you samples? … It is a dog-eat-dog world out here.”
In Texas, officials with a Supply Chain Strike Force convened this week by Gov. Greg Abbott (R) are manning the phones inside the state’s emergency operations center in hopes of screening a rush of international brokers and businesses.
“I’m getting emails, LinkedIn messages, Facebook messages from people I’ve never heard of in my entire life, saying, ‘I’ve got a supplier that can get you this or that,’ ” said John Wittman, an Abbott spokesman.
For American hospitals, the crisis is here with no end in sight. The United States has more confirmed infections than any other country, with 82,000 cases and counting, updated data Thursday showed.
Some of the intermediaries acknowledge they are capitalizing on the chaos of a market where hospitals and state health leaders bid against one another for dwindling supplies.
Andre Leite and Adrian Small, Washington D.C.-based luxury real estate agents with no medical-supply experience, said they have been cold-calling hospitals, mayors and nurses groups with an extraordinary offer: all the protective material they could need, delivered for an affordable price. They insist they know the right factories from their days buying porcelain and home-remodeling materials from Chinese industrial zones. And for their services, all they’re asking is a profit margin of about 20 percent.
“That’s the minimum I can go,” Leite said in an interview. “I’m telling people, ‘Stick your hand in your pocket, fish out a few bucks, and let’s do something about it.’ ”
Bonamo, of RWJBarnabas Health, said a team of hospital executives now sifts through a daily flood of pitches demanding upfront payments for a chance at supplies. Prices change by the day, soaring for the items health-care providers need most. Surgical masks that once cost 3 to 5 cents now cost several dollars a piece, while coveted N95 masks that once cost less than a dollar are now sold for $7.50 or more.
“There’s a cacophony of emails and texts and phone calls from people who know people who have product,” Bonamo said. “Very often they’re middlemen: There’s a lot of people out there with product who were never in this business before, but they’re entrepreneurial, they see the opportunity, they have connections in China or elsewhere around the world.”
Major manufacturers and armies of volunteers have banded together to donate millions of masks and other equipment to medical providers across the country. But there still aren’t enough, leaving an opening for for-profit businesses and speculators who often also bid for the same supplies.
“The dynamic of the market is very weird at this point,” said Andrew Stroup, a co-founder of Project N95, a nonprofit clearinghouse working to connect hospitals with suppliers. The group has received more than 2,000 requests from health-care institutions searching for more than 110 million pieces of personal protective equipment.
“With the shift of how the market is operating and the lack of a timetable as well, things are feeling very uncomfortably unnatural,” Stroup said. “There’s a lot of demand and a lot of issues with being able to vet the supply.”
N95 respirator masks use a microscopic web of plastic threads to block 95 percent of airborne particles, making them a critical piece of protection for doctors and nurses. Federal agencies regulate the masks’ use and manufacture in the United States.
Some hospital executives said they worry the masks they’re being sold are coming from unregulated factories seeking to capitalize on the booming market: Though real masks and counterfeits look similar, they offer widely different levels of protection that could leave health providers at risk.
The price gouging has hollowed out public health budgets, officials say. Minnesota-based industrial giant 3M, which makes hundreds of millions of N95 masks a year, said in a statement Tuesday it had “received reports of an increase in fraudulent and counterfeit” masks and was working to find and stop “pandemic profiteers.”
The FBI said this week that it had also seen a rise in N95 fraud, with investigators saying that scam listings had led victims to lose more than $3 million so far this year. In one case, a seller pocketed money for masks, blamed their delayed delivery on trade disruptions related to the virus and then disappeared.
A growing chorus of lawmakers from both parties had urged Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act, a 1950 law designed to give the commander in chief the authority to marshal resources in time of war. One proposed bill this week would have compelled Trump to buy 300 million N95 masks within 24 hours of enactment.
The government maintains a federal stockpile of strategic medical equipment, but states and hospitals have found it woefully deficient. State officials in Virginia learned this week that they would receive less than 10 percent of the items they had requested from a backup Department of Health and Human Services supply, Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said in an interview.
“This is a public health crisis, and people will die if we do not focus on obtaining the supplies we need to keep health-care workers safe,” said Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer. “It is shocking to me that we have people pleading for help and the administration is not using the power it has to provide that help. It is devastating.”
Rhonda Medows, president for population health at Providence St. Joseph Health in Seattle, one of the largest hospital systems on the West Coast, said she and other executives have been pleading for weeks with federal agencies for help to fill the shortfall in needed supplies.
They’ve received few answers and pitifully small shipments. The only positive response came from the Department of Agriculture, which she said offered to help find large animal ventilators that could be converted for human use.
Some medical professionals have pursued last-ditch attempts to safeguard their health. Lee Saunders, a union leader representing health-care workers, said Thursday that some health-care workers in New York have donned garbage bags because hospitals are short of protective gowns.
“This is a train wreck happening in slow motion right before our eyes,” Saunders said in a conference call. “Do the moral thing, Mr. President: Get those nurses and health-care workers the protective gear they need by invoking the Defense Production Act.”
The shortages are forcing some people to turn to untested methods. Brendan Babb, an official with the city of Anchorage, said he is working with designers on an experimental prototype of N95 masks that could be manufactured by the 3-D printers used by dental clinics and hobbyists. His team is crowdsourcing supplies and coordinating with hospitals, and he expects they could make hundreds within the next three weeks.
But until the supply lines are at capacity, some hospital executives said they expect to continue fielding calls from unusual sources. Leo Friedman, whose Chicago-based company, iPromo, sells branded pens and promotional swag for corporate events, said he has rapidly retooled his company to sell respirator masks, gloves and isolation gowns. The company is currently sending promotional blasts to health-care providers promising bulk discounts and seven-day deliveries direct from Chinese factories.
Many hospital administrators, he said, are so desperate they’re “getting ripped off left and right” by factories selling equipment for “$11, $12, $20 a mask.” His company, he assures them, is reputable. N95 masks — sold in shipments ranging from 200 masks to more than 50,000 — start at about $9.99 each."

Chandra Mohan, a 24-year-old plumber in a suburb of India’s capital, left at 3 a.m. on Friday. By midmorning, he had walked 28 miles, one bag on his back and another slung across his chest. He still had more than 600 miles to go to reach his home in the state of Bihar.
Mohan is one of thousands of people leaving India’s largest cities one footstep at a time, fleeing a pandemic in a historic exodus. There are no planes, no trains, no interstate buses and no taxis. So Mohan walked east with 17 other young men, all laborers like him. They were unsure of their route or where they would sleep or how they would eat, but one thing was certain: Without work, they cannot survive in the city.
“We’re doomed,” Mohan said bitterly. “If we don’t die of the disease, we’ll die of hunger.”
India has begun a 21-day nationwide lockdown — the biggest in the world — in a desperate bid to stop the coronavirus from spreading out of control in this densely populated nation of 1.3 billion people. There are more than 700 confirmed cases in India, a number that is rising rapidly. Nonessential businesses are shut, state borders are closed to regular traffic, and people have been asked to stay in their homes except to buy food or medicine.
The suspension of passenger trains, the backbone of India’s transportation system, was announced Sunday with nearly immediate effect. Then, on Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the all-India lockdown.
Three days later, Indians were adjusting to a starkly different reality. Reports of widespread harassment of citizens by police had eased even as bottlenecks persisted in the distribution of essential goods in some parts of the country.
The speed of the transportation shutdown meant that India’s tens of millions of internal migrants had no time to get home. Indian cities rely on a vast workforce drawn from the rest of the ­country, laborers who move in search of opportunity and often leave their families behind for months or years. They work construction, drive taxis, staff restaurants and much more, living frugally and returning home each year.
For such migrant workers, who are often employed in low-paid, precarious jobs, the measures are a double blow. The economic shock has vaporized their incomes while the transport restrictions eliminated their normal ways home.
The result has been a walking exodus of thousands of people. Precisely how many are on the move is not clear, but since the lockdown was declared, each day has brought fresh reports of migrants trying to get home. Some have managed to hitch rides on trucks, or jam themselves into crowded private buses.
The last time so many people were traveling long distances on foot was in 1947, during the bloody partition of the Indian Subcontinent, said Chinmay Tumbe, the author of a recent book on migration in India. When India became independent and Pakistan was created, millions of people fled to the other side of newly drawn borders. “Even then we had transport options,” Tumbe said. “There were trains running.”
There are already signs that workers are turning to smugglers in the hopes of getting home. Authorities found hundreds of people crammed into trucks and believe hundreds of others hid inside an empty freight car to move from one end of the country to the other, according to a local media report.
Rajiv Khandelwal is executive director of Aajeevika Bureau, an organization based in Rajasthan focused on migrant workers. His group has received “an avalanche” of distress calls in recent days, he said. Many callers are stranded at state borders, unable to cross and running out of food after losing their jobs.
“Everybody has a right to go home when so much fear and frenzy has been created,” Khandelwal said. “This is no way to condemn people on whose hard work these cities prosper.”
In its rush to institute a nationwide lockdown, India offered no formal help to poor migrants. That stands in sharp contrast to its treatment of citizens stranded abroad because of the pandemic: The government organized special flights to bring Indians home from China, Iran and Italy.
Arjun Kumar, 20, and his four cousins came to Delhi to work over the past year, earning $4.50 a day on construction sites. But there has been no work for days. Their home is more than 450 miles away in Basti, a district in the state of Uttar Pradesh. On Friday, they walked east under a light drizzle on roads emptied of traffic.
Kumar carried a purple shoulder bag printed with teddy bears and urged the group to keep moving. At least in their village, they won’t starve, he said. “Here in the city, who will feed us?”
Most of the people walking are men, many of them young, but there are also some families. Payal Kumar, 19, sat on the edge of a sidewalk Friday, using a scarf as a makeshift mask. She was barefoot; her only pair of sandals had broken as she walked. Her group’s water was gone, she was tired and had no idea how long it would take to reach their home 150 miles away.
Kumar was walking with her sister Divya and her sister’s in-laws. One of them, Anar Singh, 35, works as part of the housekeeping staff at a Radisson hotel. His employer told him to stop coming to work nine days ago when the hotel closed down. He says he has yet to receive his salary for the month. He had about $5 in his pocket.
The group carried bags containing a few items of clothing and some flatbreads to eat. They hoped to be able to shelter in a shop or market at night. “For now, we have to keep walking,” Singh said.
Near one of Delhi’s long-distance bus stations, migrants converged in the vain hope that some transport might be available. By midmorning, they numbered in the hundreds. Stick-wielding police officers began herding them down the road.
One officer stopped a group of migrants and used a loudspeaker to make an announcement. “You have to maintain a distance of at least one meter from each other,” he said. The weary crowd dutifully shuffled a bit apart. A good Samaritan pulled up and offered biscuits and tea from the back of a motorcycle.
Rajesh Mishra, 30, a painter who had been walking for four hours, listened to the officer’s speech. His home is 500 miles away in the city of Gorakhpur. “We’re stuck,” he said. “Either we stay and die, or leave and die.” Then he turned and joined the stream of people stretching into the distance."

It’s now ramping up programs to directly help businesses, and Congress has a few things to say about that.If taxpayer funds are used to backstop a new vehicle called the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, there will be restrictions on executive compensation, according to the $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package signed by President Donald Trump Friday.
Loans to mid-sized businesses by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, also have guidelines on corporate behavior that range from staffing levels to a ban on sending jobs overseas.
In recent decades, Fed leaders have had an automatic revulsion to anything that pushed them toward fiscal policy such as direct assistance to companies. When lawmakers asked former Chairman Ben Bernanke if he could loan to automakers during the 2008 financial crisis, his answer was: Sorry, no.
Political Risk
That kind of lending is fraught with political risks and can impact the distribution of wealth in the economy by favoring certain industries over others.
But the virus-induced economic crisis facing the country is upending such policy dogma and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has positioned the central bank as the rapid purveyor of credit of last resort. That unprecedented shift will have political consequences and lead to constrained independence on Fed direct lending, economists said.“They are going to be watched; every move they make is going to be watched,” said Julia Coronado, founding partner of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York. “They are going to want to work closely with the Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees” which oversee the Fed.
So far, several of the Fed’s facilities targeting markets have relied on the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund for a loss-absorbing cushion against risk. There are few constraints on that money. The Fed can move quickly and backstop markets any way it wants with the only precaution being not to lose money with market or credit risk.
Lawmakers have earmarked an additional $454 billion in taxpayer funds to give the Fed even more firepower for existing market programs and to start direct lending. In theory, those funds could be leveraged up to $4.5 trillion by the central bank.
Strings Attached
Those funds do come with stipulations regarding how Treasury uses the money. There is also an unusual flexibility clause for the Fed that may be politically risky.
The bill specifically grants the Fed discretion for a Main Street Lending Facility, while putting strict guidelines around the Treasury Secretary’s lending to mid-size companies, which lawmakers define as those with 500 to 10,000 employees.
These would, among other things, prohibit sending U.S. jobs overseas and demand companies retain at least 90% of their workforce at full pay with benefits. The Fed is working on standing the facility up, but has yet to publish any details.
That presents the Fed with an dilemma: even though the Fed may not be obliged to abide by these restrictions, evading them may spark lawmakers’ ire.
Hands Tied
Fed watchers are divided on how the Fed will interpret the legislation in practice.
“Fiscal policies are for legislators to decide,” said Mark Spindel, co-author of a book about the Fed’s relationship with Congress. “I don’t think he is independent here,” he said, referring to Powell’s use of taxpayer funds to expand direct Fed lending to business. “He can’t act independently of what the law is directing the Treasury Secretary to do.”
But Gilbert Schwartz, a partner at Schwartz & Ballen and a former Fed lawyer, said if Congress wanted the Fed to abide by restrictions they would have written the law that way. “Congress knows how to write the statute,” he said, while noting that Mnuchin can impose whatever conditions he wants to the funds Treasury provides the Fed.
Loaning to potentially thousands of medium-sized businesses, likely done with the help of local banks, will be a gigantic undertaking and perhaps make this the largest Fed facility ever. That would probably involve its 12 regional branches, who have deep knowledge of businesses in their districts."

Or, as some have reframed it even more barbarically: Why not sacrifice a finite number of vulnerable, mainly elderly people, well past their prime, for the greater good of reviving a thriving economy?
Here’s why not: It’s a phony choice, based on a false premise.
President Trump has not quite defined the dilemma in those terms, though he edged close by warning Americans not to “let the cure be worse than the problem.” Some of his acolytes have chosen their words less delicately, notably Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas, a Republican about to turn 70, who said he and other senior citizens are “willing to take a chance on [our] survival” to help return to normal daily life. “And if that is the exchange,” said Mr. Patrick, “I’m all in.”
Mr. Patrick may be offering in good faith to gamble his life for the sake of the younger generation. And he’s right that there will be severe costs — including to health and well-being — of the recession we are essentially imposing on ourselves. No one wants social distancing to last any longer than necessary, and the government should certainly be planning now the safest possible ways to return society gradually to productivity.
But there is no easy “exchange” that would spare young people — even if we were prepared to accept the immorality of jeopardizing people’s lives based on age.
Let’s suppose Americans were to do what Mr. Patrick and Mr. Trump have suggested — get back to work in a few weeks and pack the churches on Easter Sunday because, as the two men evidently believe, the economy cannot remain indefinitely in a coma. Yes, many elderly Americans would get sick and die in the ensuing weeks and months — maybe hundreds of thousands, very likely millions. But so would countless other people.
The quick and certain result of a damn-the-torpedoes approach would be to overwhelm and break the health-care system. Hospitals would fill to overflowing. Those in need of ventilators would be out of luck — not only covid-19 patients but also babies, children, tweens and anyone else in respiratory distress. People who suffer strokes, heart attacks, broken bones and gunshot wounds would arrive at hospitals — if they were lucky or rich enough to find ambulances — to find emergency rooms resembling Grand Central Terminial at rush hour. Doctors, nurses and medical technicians would face extraordinary risks; many would not be spared.
That’s not an “exchange,” as Mr. Patrick simplistically imagines. It’s a social, political, moral — and economic — cataclysm.
The costs of the pandemic-induced shutdown are colossal — to the economy, society and the nation’s collective emotional and mental health. As dangerous as that is, it is more dangerous still to pretend the pandemic can be harnessed by diktat and wishful thinking."

As patients flood emergency departments and health-care workers struggle to respond, an international group of robotic experts is making a case for some electronic intervention.
In an editorial in the journal Science Robotics, they argue that covid-19 could drive new developments in robotics — and that the devices could help with more effective diagnosis, screening and patient care.
If the thought of robotic assistants sounds futuristic, it isn’t: Robots already have been enlisted in the fight against the virus. In Hong Kong, a fleet of miniature robots disinfects the city’s subways; in China, an entire field hospital was staffed by robots designed to relieve overworked health-care workers.
In the United States, robots played a role in the country’s first known case of covid-19. One outfitted with a stethoscope and a microphone was used with a 35-year-old man in Everett, Wash., who was confined to an isolated unit after showing symptoms of the coronavirus. He later made a full recovery.
“Already, we have seen robots being deployed for disinfection, delivering medications and food, measuring vital signs, and assisting border controls,” the researchers write.
They identify plenty of other ways to use robots in the pandemic response. Robots could assist with testing and screening; already, researchers have created a device that can identify a suitable vein and perform a blood draw. Or they could take over hospital disinfection entirely, providing continuous sterilization of high-touch areas with UV light.
The researchers hope covid-19 will catalyze robotics research for the sake of public health. But it isn’t as simple as pressing a power button: It will take a significant investment for specialized robots to hit the market in time to save lives.
The field has been down this road before. After the 2015 Ebola outbreak, opportunities were identified. Implementation, however, remains limited.
“Without sustained research efforts robots will, once again, not be ready for the next incident,” they warn."
"March 28, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-yorks-bioethics-experts-prepare-for-a-wave-of-difficult-decisions/2020/03/28/4501f522-7045-11ea-a3ec-70d7479d83f0_story.html,The Washington Post,New York’s bioethics experts prepare for a wave of difficult decisions,"NEW YORK — As the coronavirus pandemic fills medical beds, saps supplies of lifesaving equipment and protective gear, and exhausts clinicians, ethics experts will be on hand to help hospitals make tough choices. At the heart of the matter is a question: How do you choose between patients when allocating limited resources?
“There is no more fundamental ethical tension than the tension of the distribution of scarce resources,” said Emory University bioethics expert Paul root Wolpe, president of the Association of Bioethics Program Directors.
In New York, the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the United States, the virus’s spread has thrown that tension into stark relief. The challenges the state’s hospitals face are those that will likely appear in other areas of the country in the coming weeks.
New York has more than 52,000 confirmed cases, the bulk of which are in New York City.
“There’s a whole slew of: How do we ration our resources?” said Arthur Caplan, who directs the medical ethics division at New York University Langone Medical Center. “When do we give up on somebody and move on to somebody else?” he said. “How do we balance trying to help people with respiratory failure from the virus versus heart attacks?”
Ventilators, the devices that help pump oxygen into the bodies of critically ill patients, are in short supply. “The ventilators will make the difference between life and death, literally, for these people,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) told reporters on Tuesday.
New York has about 10,000 of the machines. Officials estimate the state, especially in New York City, will need 30,000 more. “Our supply of ventilators in our public hospitals is really being stressed,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) told the radio station 1010 WINS on Monday.
This week, some hospitals in the city began sharing single ventilators among two patients via a pathway of tubes. That eleventh-hour technique, also used after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, risks exposing patients to each others’ microbes, said Calvin D. Sun, a physician who works in New York City emergency departments.
“Hospitals are going to get overloaded. More patients are going to need ventilators,” said ophthalmologist Samuel Packer, who was Northwell Health’s ethics director during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009.
Packer was a member of an ethics task force that created in 2015 New York’s 300-page guide for the allocation of ventilators during a flu pandemic.
Although it is the foundation for ventilator policies across New York’s hospitals, such a massive document is “not really a helpful thing to hand to an intensive care nurse,” said Tia Powell, director of the Montefiore Einstein Center for Bioethics. Montefiore’s ethicists recently distilled that guide into key points and distributed the abridged version among hospital staff. This includes a plan for phases of increasing severity.
“We’re already in phase one,” Powell said, in which elective surgeries are canceled and capacity to care for more patients is expanded. In phase two, “you really might be in trouble,” she said, requiring the tougher decisions around allocating “scarce resources.”
When there aren’t enough beds, for instance, “you develop a triage situation,” Packer said. That’s nothing new for medical experts. (The 200-year-old origin of triage, though it’s not quite the same as in a hospital, is attributed to the chief surgeon who tended to Napoleon’s Imperial Guard.)
Distributing such resources as ventilators can involve medical considerations, such as whether certain organs have failed.
But they should also involve fairness, social justice and other ethical principles, Packer said. “In ethics, you talk about being utilitarian — doing the greatest good for the greatest number,” he said, which he considers a philosophy well-suited for situations such as these.
Wolpe and his colleagues have been busy reviewing more than 60 pandemic policies from medical centers across the country. “The general idea is very common,” he said. “That is to, first of all, prioritize people who are going to make it through.”
Although a patient’s age is not the only consideration, it is one. “It would be dishonest if we didn’t say age is a driver,” Caplan said. “Age is correlated with resilience.” Because younger patients, in general, get better faster, they may free up a ventilator more quickly for the next patient.
This week, the New England Journal of Medicine published a guide to allocating ventilators. The highest priority, the authors of that report wrote, should be to “save the most lives” and “life-years,” not to distribute the machines on a first-come basis. All else being equal, health-care workers and participants in research should receive priority, they said.
But there’s no simple formula, Wolpe pointed out. “It’s a very difficult, complex and emotionally wrenching . . . process.”
The decision to allocate a resource like a ventilator can be a battle within the hospital because physicians so vigorously protect the patients in their care. “Each doctor’s patient is more important than the other guy’s patient,” Packer said. “So ethics gets called. We give them our best shot.”
This process can take up to 10 hours, he said — less in a crisis, when members of ethics committees must “walk and chew gum at the same time,” Packer said. When “we have city hospitals that are overwhelmed, in cases like that, we call administration right away,” he said, and committees can convene quickly by video chat.
Not everyone will be able to receive “aggressive” treatments but all patients deserve to be cared for, said Renee McLeod-Sordjan, who succeeded Packer as the ethics director at Northwell Health, the largest health-care system in the state. “That baseline treatment is comfort. That baseline treatment is relief from suffering.”
She struck a note of tenacity. “Hospitals, in general, are prepared quite well for disasters,” McLeod-Sordjan said. She has worked through disease outbreaks before, when she was “just becoming a baby nurse” during the 1980s HIV epidemic.
“Being anxious around what’s going to happen is an opportunity for mistakes,” she said. “One of the things that we’re trying to do across health systems and, particularly in medical ethics, is to divorce uncertainty from anxiety.”
Part of that, she said, was managing anxious workers and relieving their overloaded schedules. “We’re asking people to come out of retirement and to get temporary licenses from the state,” so clinicians from other states can assist New York’s hospital systems.
“I know that there are people who think, ‘This is an emergency! Ethics-shmethics!’ ” Powell said. “That’s a terrible way to think about things in a disaster. You need to remember what makes us human.”"

Spain, in a state of emergency because of the coronavirus, achieved this on Tuesday with a seven-year bond sale that attracted more than 36 billion euros of orders.
The country was one of 11 high-grade borrowers testing the waters in what was the busiest day of the month for bond sales and the fourth-busiest of the year. This week’s volumes have already surpassed the total of the first three weeks of March, when the outbreak really suppressed supply. Wednesday is set to be even bigger.
Raising such a jumbo deal did mean Spain had to offer a yield that was 18 basis points higher than an existing, slightly shorter seven-year bond. Its last syndicated issue, earlier this year, came with a lower yield than its existing debt. However, the world has changed profoundly and issuers have to be prepared to dangle a carrot to entice investor demand. In the circumstances, this wasn’t much of a premium for investors.
A similar phenomenon was also evident for the European Investment Bank, whose three-year bond deal came at an 11 basis-point premium to its existing equivalent. Likewise, premiums were in evidence Monday for new deals from the German States of Bavaria and Saxony-Anhalt. Though, again, they weren’t huge, which shows how desperate investors are to find somewhere to put their money.
Corporate deals are making a comeback too: Unilever NV and Engie SA last week followed the trend for higher yields. Company issuance has seen the biggest decline in the bond market this year, unsurprisingly give the business shutdowns, running nearly 20% behind last year’s pace. Coca Cola European Partners, Sanofi and Nestle SA all came to the market with multi-tranche issues on Tuesday, illustrating the improvement in conditions. Heineken NV, Danaher Corp. and Carrefour SA were doing benchmark euro deals on Wednesday.
The European Central Bank can breathe a bit easier as its 1 trillion euros of quantitative easing planned for the rest of this year is starting to take effect. As there will be considerable emphasis on its corporate sector purchasing program, many of the new investment grade deals should benefit from being scooped up by the ECB, if they’re from Europe-based issuing entities.
Wednesday has also seen the return of major banks with Lloyds Banking Group Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. all bringing euro deals. Credit spreads (the yield on corporate debt relative to sovereign benchmarks) have ballooned since late February, offering better returns for investors than government bonds if they have cash to put to work. Those spreads will start to narrow, but the virus has created a new paradigm, whereby a decent new-issue premium is essential to a successful deal. 
Normality is returning to European debt capital markets, but the heady days of super-tight credit spreads and incredibly low non-core government bond yields look to be over."

Then hotels. Now, a linen company is making medical masks.","HOUSTON — The moment Princess Cruises canceled its order, the Kammerman family knew the coronavirus was going to be a calamity for the world and their linens business.
Royal Caribbean was the next to cancel. Then Marriott. Soon, dozens of longtime hospitality customers of the family-owned company backed out of their orders as the number of covid-19 cases spread across the globe and people retreated into their homes.
“That’s when we knew we were in big trouble,” said Glenn Kammerman, president of Gourmet Table Skirts & Linens, one of the last U.S.-based textile manufacturers. “We had to get creative because the pipeline was drying up.”
Like many small businesses around the country, the future of Gourmet Table Skirts & Linens was in peril because of the coronavirus and its related shutdowns. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans not to board cruise ships, one of the company’s biggest clients. Millions under stay-at-home orders were not checking into hotels, and bans on large gatherings and pleas for social distancing meant the company’s tablecloths and napkins were no longer being used at weddings, meetings and banquets.
For the first time in decades, the cacophony inside the Kammermans’ cavernous southwest Houston factory went quiet. Giant rolls of polyester and cotton fabric were still in plastic. Sewing machines no longer buzzed. The work bell clanged for no one as most of the company’s 85 employees — largely immigrants — were cloistered at home under a stay-at-home order issued by Harris County.
But every unraveling thread has its mends in the case of the Kammermans.
Days of nonstop news coverage about the looming shortages in personal protective equipment at the nation’s hospitals gave the family an idea.
Over text messages last week, Kammerman, his sales director son, Howard, account executive daughter, Sarah Gayle, and head designer, Hilda Garcia, batted around ideas for a breathable, washable, hygienic, medical face mask.
If people were crafting masks in their living rooms, the Kammermans thought, how much more could they do in their 43,000-square-foot factory? Garcia took scraps of fabric home on the weekend to start on a prototype — a 100 percent cotton mask with elastic bands.
Howard Kammerman asked a friend who owns four urgent-care facilities in the Houston area to review the design. By Tuesday, doctors wanted 500 for the first order.
“This won’t completely offset our losses,” he said, adding that the masks are priced at $2.25 each. “But it’s a way to keep our workers employed and produce something that fills a gap and is desperately needed.”
'A wake-up call for all of us.'
Glenn Kammerman has had to reinvent himself and his business more than once. His family had long been in the textile business, making uniforms for hotel workers, when he was drafted for the Vietnam War in his 20s. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, supporting B-52 bomber missions in Southeast Asia.
When he returned to Houston in 1971, Kammerman joined his father in the table skirt business after oil tycoon John W. Mecom Sr. asked the pair to cover and dress the tables at a hotel event where they were supplying uniforms. The idea for table skirts was born that day. Kammerman later wanted something of his own and went into the gift shop business during Big Oil’s boom times. But it would all soon go bust when oil prices cratered in the 1980s.
“In 1986, Houston became a ghost town,” Kammerman recalled. “The price of oil dropped to $10 a barrel, and my shops were dead.”
Kammerman went back into the table skirt business on his own, working with his wife and mother-in-law to send out hundreds of postcards to big hotels outside Houston offering high-quality custom skirts. Little by little, the responses started coming. He then met Garcia, a skinny undocumented woman from Honduras looking for work. She would eventually become indispensable to the success of Kammerman’s business and family.
By the 1990s, the company was selling globally to the Hong Kong Convention Center, distributors in Saudi Arabia and the Ritz Carlton in Australia. But sewing houses were a dying business, a relic in the United States.
Still, during the 2000s, Kammerman resisted pressure to move his operation overseas, as so many other American manufacturers had done. The competition from Chinese textile factories grew stiff, but he invested more deeply in the “Made in the USA” labels he proudly affixed to his table linens with more automation and a bigger building.
“I heard it all the time, ‘You can do it cheaper over there,’ ” Kammerman said. “But I wanted to control the quality and make a good product. It’s a question of pride.”
Gourmet earned a reputation for attentive customer service and guaranteed the craftsmanship of its work. The texture, color, finish and stitching of his linens became Kammerman’s passion. He can describe the intricacies of using Velcro clips instead of snap buttons to attach skirts to tables with the fervor of a missionary. He roped his children into the work he brought home until they found themselves working alongside him as adults.
The 73-year-old walks the floor of his factory today with the confidence of a gambler who hits his number every time, defiant of the naysayers. The unfastened top buttons of his dress shirt reveal the gold chain around his neck bearing the dearest symbols of his life: a golden copy of his dog tags and a gold Star of David.
Facing yet another threat to his business, the sanguine entrepreneur looked around his factory on Thursday — eerie in its near silence and emptiness — and grinned as his son-in-law reported that the markets had jumped that morning.
“I think this is a good lesson for America to realize what the world’s about,” the septuagenarian said. “It’s a wake-up call for all of us.”
Production has barely begun, but Garcia, a perfectionist who gained legal status under amnesty in the 1980s and has been with the company ever since, is tweaking the design every time a new mask comes off the line. She’s thought about adding a pocket for physicians to add filters or double-plying. She wondered whether the fabric of cloth diapers might work better.
Garcia’s attention to detail is why the Kammermans call her the boss. She’s been to all the Kammerman weddings and bat and bar mitzvahs. Most of Gourmet’s employees have spent 20 years or more with the company, the family said.
The first lot of masks will be made from the fabric the company ordinarily uses for napkins at high-end restaurants and will be crafted at a single-needle sewing machine. Once the design is set, they will program Gourmet’s machinery to scale up automated production. No one has been laid off, and Kammerman is not taking a salary to keep everyone together. He is hoping the bet pays off and normalcy returns.
“This is the test run,” Garcia said as she pulled open the pleated front of the soft ivory mask she had just sewn and slipped the bands over ears. Two men cut long rolls of fabric into 9.5-inch rectangles for the masks.
A few women were pedaling away at every other sewing machine, wearing paper facial masks and staggering their lunch breaks to comply with social distancing.
The company has not shipped any boxes yet, but Howard Kammerman is already hearing from other interested health-care providers. Maybe they can try hospital gowns? Or operating-room blankets? An ambulance company sent him an inquiring text.
Gayle predicted the pandemic will change the way Americans live. Face masks could become the must-have accessory of the decade for not just hospitals but also day cares, offices and everyday errands. Our relationship with contagions and germs is changing, she said. Manufacturing, her father said, needs to come back to meet the demand.
“Who knows? Maybe there will be a Gourmet Medical Supply soon.” Kammerman chuckled. “Things need to be made here. If this is needed, we are available.”"

The man who fleeced innocent souls through what the conservative National Review called the “massive scam” of Trump University is applying the same hucksterism to a situation where thousands of lives are at stake.
The quarantine caper ought to be the straw that breaks the hustler’s back.
There was Trump telling reporters in the early afternoon: “There is a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine, short term, two weeks, on New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut,” he said, expressing worry that “a lot of New Yorkers are going down” to Florida.
Media-wise, all hell broke loose.
Of course he had never spoken to the governors of the affected states beforehand. Of course this was a way of shifting blame for his own incompetence to the stricken people of three Democratic states that would never vote for him. Of course he never considered whether he even had the power to do what he claimed he might do.
And of course it was all fake.
Having milked the “possibility” for a long news cycle, he informed the world on Twitter at 8:19 p.m. Saturday: “A quarantine will not be necessary.”
There are two lessons here. The first is that the media must treat Trump the way they treat anyone else who regularly offers lies along with idle but explosive conjecture. His daily journey before the White House cameras is no different from any of his other swindles, and his “briefings” should be treated with the contempt they deserve.
He uses them to threaten anyone who criticizes him, stages praise sessions from the sycophants who work for him, and makes sham announcements with all the solidity of tissue paper. (“I’d love to have it open by Easter,” he said of the economy. That would have been April 12; on Sunday night, he announced an extension of the social-distancing guidelines to April 30.) He has squandered the right to any of the deference usually accorded presidents in times of crisis.
The second lesson is more important for the long run. We are learning, in both good ways and bad, about the importance of competent, energetic and empathetic government. For the past week, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been offering a running seminar on this subject for all who will listen, both in a floor speech and in a phone interview from his home in Brooklyn.
In voting — unanimously in the Senate — for a $2.2 trillion economic rescue bill, Schumer told me, Republicans acknowledged what they regularly deny: that government is indispensable, especially “when there’s an emergency, when lives are at stake, and when you need quick action.” Also: when “the private sector cannot do the job.”
“It’s a little bit of an awakening for them,” Schumer observed of his GOP colleagues, “that yes, you need a government here.”
But the other side is that government needs to know what it’s doing. Here, the Trump administration has reminded us of how things can fall apart when it doesn’t — when “good, substantive people leave” public service.
“The agencies are hollowed out,” Schumer said. “Where you normally go to call somebody . . . there’s no one home in the White House. This happened over and over again, but it’s more urgent now.”
So, yes, worry about how quick and effective the Trump administration will be in getting the money Congress just provided to Americans in need and to failing small businesses. And it will be important to fight Trump’s already declared resistance to transparency when it comes to the billions that will be handed out to big corporations.
“We’re going to have to oversee the executive branch like a hawk to make sure they do things,” Schumer said. But he warned: “We can give him the resources and we can put a lot of public pressure on him, but ultimately if he’s resistant to the right arguments and the public pressure, there’s no way to actually force him.”
No, there isn’t, but the pressure must be brought nonetheless — by Congress, by governors of both parties struggling for resources, and by the media. Success depends on denying Trump the ability to displace our focus from the things that matter to his carnival of fanciful proclamations, reprisals against enemies, and sweeping promises that are as disconnected from reality as he is from the truth."

The drama began when California Governor Gavin Newsom called out the bank for not offering 90-day grace periods to mortgage borrowers affected by the coronavirus, despite such pledges by rivals including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. A journalist tweeted the lashing, and then Corden reposted it to his 10.7 million followers. The bank raced to correct what it called the governor’s mistake.
Just over an hour later, the firm promised Corden it would defer payments on home loans for as long as the crisis requires. He relented, putting the internet’s fury to rest:
Across the nation, bankers are on edge. Publicly, they’re emphasizing that unlike the last downturn in 2008 they aren’t the cause of this collapse and they intend to help America get through it. Privately, they worry they’re destined to get cast as villains.
Once the government enacts its $2 trillion rescue package, banks are going to be the last resort for millions of consumers and businesses needing additional support to weather months of hardship. The nation’s eight banking titans have enough excess capital to ramp up lending by $1.6 trillion, but even that probably isn’t enough to meet everyone’s needs.
That means bankers will often decide which borrowers get relief from existing loans or access to more credit -- make-or-break moments for people and businesses trying to avoid default and insolvency.
One of the industry’s most senior leaders put it this way: The country’s banks are strong and ready to support the economy -- but they can’t afford to lend irresponsibly to clients who can’t repay. That limits the ability of banks to lend to others.
“The best credits are made in the worst of times,” said Julie Solar, a senior analyst who tracks North American financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. As the virus’s toll on the economy worsens, lenders will eventually be forced to pick winners and losers, she said. “Those borrowers who are higher investment grade are going to fare better.”
‘Fine Line’
There are also ethical questions: Banks must walk a “fine line” to prevent desperate clients from overburdening themselves with debts they can’t repay, Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat told the Financial Times this week. That’s “the last thing that we all want to see.”
Bank of America’s quick move to head off a Twitter backlash shows how worried banks are about keeping public criticism at bay. The lender followed up with a statement saying Newsom was mistaken and that it plans to defer payments on a monthly basis until the end of the crisis.
Banks have many other lending decisions ahead. It’s not hard to imagine people and employers facing rejection will feel they could’ve made it through if their bankers just gave them a chance. Such accusations have deep roots in American history, notably the Great Depression.
Desperation is rapidly mounting.
Companies hit first by the sudden halt to global travel -- such as airlines, hotels, cruise-ship operators, casinos and oil producers -- have been drawing down billions of dollars from existing credit lines for weeks. Their pain soon spread to restaurants, retailers and legions of small businesses as a growing number mayors and governors told residents to stay home.
On Thursday, the U.S. reported an unprecedented surge in the number of people seeking jobless benefits, with 3.28 million filing claims in just one week.
Behind the scenes, senior bankers said they are rapidly reevaluating their loan portfolios to gauge how the virus and social distancing measures are likely to affect corporate customers, trying to figure out which are most or least resilient.
Banks have been honoring credit lines they offered corporate clients in the halcyon years before the pandemic. One looming question is whether lenders might invoke the so-called MAC, or “materially adverse change” clauses, to stop drawdowns. One concern is that some businesses with little to no chance of making it through will siphon off billions in loans that could go toward supporting others.
Citing those clauses risks sending shock waves across the industry, potentially prompting stronger companies to draw down their lines preemptively. Still, one high-level banker said he’s expecting to see a few denials this year.
Banks are trying to maintain goodwill in Washington, working in close coordination with regulators on measures to shore up the financial system. Earlier this month, a delegation of CEOs from firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of America visited the White House to offer reassurances that they can weather the turmoil and help others.
In the days since, national and regional lenders have rolled out a series of good deeds. They pledged more than $200 million to charities and relief efforts. Some offered branch workers extra pay. Several suspended long-planned layoffs to give workers certainty.
While the stimulus bill passed by the Senate this week includes clauses offering some borrowers forbearance, consumer advocates have been urging banks to go further on their own.
Lawmakers are ratcheting up pressure on lenders to help constituents in other ways. Last week, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey pushed banks and credit unions in their home state of Massachusetts to suspend a variety of fees -- such as charges for late payments, overdrafts and using ATMS -- that generate billions of dollars in annual revenue nationally.
To conserve funds for lending, the country’s largest banks vowed to stop buying back their own shares through at least the middle of the year. The move comes at a cost for investors, some of whom would have preferred firms snap up shares at depressed prices, blunting this year’s 40% plunge in the KBW Bank Index.
“The biggest difference between now and 2008 is that the banks are a source of strength rather than the source of the problem,” said Tom Naratil, co-head of UBS Group AG’s wealth management unit. “This is the time for banks, obviously prudently, to make sure that we are extending credit to our clients.”"

“This will deliver urgently needed relief,” Trump told reporters at the White House, as he was joined by GOP leaders but no Democrats. “We’re going to keep our small businesses strong and our big businesses strong.”
The hard-won plan willprovide a massive injection of loans, tax breaks and direct payments to large corporations, small businesses and individuals whose revenue and income have plummeted under “social distancing” restrictions meant to slow the virus’ spread.
The U.S. has become the worldwide epicenter of the epidemic, with more than 97,000 people infected, surpassing China.
Stocks finished Friday in the red following a three-day rally. Traders cut positions ahead of the weekend despite passage of the stimulus bill. The S&P 500 fell 3.4% while the Dow dropped 4.1%.
Trump urged Congress to quickly finalize the package, saying earlier that it would “deliver much-needed financial assistance to hardworking families and small businesses.”
The prospect of a long-term blow to the economy has prompted Trump to consider easing federal guidelines, despite warnings from governors, public health experts and some members of his own administration they should stay in place for longer.
Trump has repeatedly spoken of “re-opening” the country by Easter and on Thursday he told governors he would rank different areas of the country based on risk level in order to allow states to eventually relax quarantine and social distancing measures.
The package provides roughly $500 billion in loans and other assistance for major companies, including $62 billion for the airline sector, as well as cities and states struggling with virus-related financial burdens.
It includes $350 billion in aid for small businesses and offers $1,200 direct payments to middle- and low-income American adults, plus $500 for each child. Hospitals would receive $117 billion in assistance, as many become overwhelmed with virus patients. Unemployment insurance would also grow to $600 per week, on top of existing state benefits.
The size of the package far surpasses the $800 billion measure signed by former President Barack Obama following the 2008 financial crisis. Combined with Federal Reserve measures, it would provide around $6 trillion in stimulus to the economy, according to chief White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow.
But the plan might not be enough to stave off an economic recession or another spike in unemployment. Even before it passed, leaders in Congress said another round of stimulus would almost surely be needed.
“This is not going to be the last bill,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday on PBS.
The package came together over several days of marathon talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer. The Senate passed the bill on Wednesday with an overwhelming 96-0 vote.
The House passed it by voice vote on Friday.
“This is a proud moment for our country,” McConnell said at the White House, where he joined Trump.
Democrats had demanded transparency measures on the $500 billion corporate assistance fund and they ultimately won language requiring the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to publish who receives loans every seven days.
The bill was held up for days until the language was added, sparking a round of partisan squabbling in Washington. Leaders also included conditions to the aid, including the ability of the Treasury Department to take equity stakes in companies that require cash assistance.
The House planned to swiftly pass the stimulus package on Friday but the plan hit a speed bump when Representative Thomas Massie, a libertarian Republican from Kentucky, suggested he would delay a vote until lawmakers returned to Washington to cast their votes in person.
Trump and lawmakers in both parties chided Massie for forcing hundreds of members to leave their home states for a maneuver that would ultimately fail to stop passage of the bill.
“Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation,” New York Republican Peter King wrote on Twitter. “Because of one member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House. Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.”
Trump blasted also Massie, using Twitter to call him a “third rate Grandstander” and saying he should be thrown out of the Republican Party."

Balance Sheet
The bipartisan agreement, which still needs to be passed by the Senate and House and signed into law by President Donald Trump, will include $454 billion in funds for the Treasury to backstop emergency actions by the Fed to support the U.S. economy, Senator Patrick Toomey said on Wednesday.
The central bank will work with the U.S. Treasury to use that money as a backstop against credit risk as it supports markets for corporate and short-term state and local debt, while also loaning directly to large and medium-sized businesses.
Its lending facilities have typically required a loss-absorbing cushion of around 10% from the Treasury to protect it from loans that don’t get paid back, a feature that Toomey indicated he wanted preserved. On that basis, every dollar from the Treasury can stand behind $10 dollars lent by the Fed.
“It is a very, very big thing; it is unprecedented,” the Pennsylvania Republican told reporters Wednesday on a conference call, adding it was an opportunity to lever up “the unlimited balance sheet of the Fed.”
Toomey’s comments suggest Fed facilities could be expanded with the new funds, in effect doubling the Fed’s current $4.7 trillion balance sheet if necessary. On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the bill would provide up to $4 trillion in liquidity through broad-based lending programs operated by the Fed.
A Fed spokesperson declined to comment.
The central bank has launched a dramatic range of emergency measures to shelter the blow from the virus, which has brought important parts of the economy to a grinding halt as governors in several states ordered a stop to all but the most essential activity. It has slashed interest rates to almost zero and is pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into financial markets to keep credit flowing.
Those actions were ramped up on Monday, when the Fed also announced it was also working hard on a Main Street Business Lending Program to support medium-sized businesses.
Corporate Debt
It also launched two other facilities -- one to support the secondary market for corporate debt, and a second to lend or buy bonds directly from large corporations, an unprecedented bypass of the banking system that has redefined the Fed’s role in economic emergencies. With these moves, the Fed has surpassed actions it took during the 2008 financial crisis and has become the nation’s bridge lender of last resort.
Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG in New York, said the Fed’s credit facilities are in effect short-term bridge loans critical to keeping both small and large businesses afloat so they can hire back furloughed or laid-off workers when the pandemic subsides.
Chain Reaction
“There is a transmission channel from large corporations, to small- and medium-sized enterprises and to households” as each tries to extend temporary credit or keep paying staff, Hunter said, adding that the Fed programs will be vital.
“What I am hearing business leaders say is, ‘We don’t want to shut out our customers. If they have a temporary decline in ability to pay, we want to extend credit to bridge them to the other side of the crisis as much as possible,” she said.
The U.S. banking system has already been tapped for hundreds of millions of dollars via credit lines as companies try and shore up short-term cash positions.
To keep credit flowing in the financial markets, the Fed has also launched facilities to support the issuance of commercial paper and asset-backed securities, as well as programs to lend to bond dealers and backstop money market funds."
"March 30, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/what-a-liquidity-trap-is-and-why-were-looking-at-one/2020/03/30/bda9af30-728c-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,What a Liquidity Trap Is and Why We’re Looking at One,"The Federal Reserve is doing everything it can to keep the U.S. economy from crashing during the shutdown to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. But some people fear that the Fed has fallen into a “liquidity trap.” That’s a situation in which the central bank’s efforts to stimulate spending fail because people hoard cash instead.
1. What’s liquidity?
“Liquid” means easy to spend, like cash. Bonds aren’t as liquid, but they earn interest. So in ordinary times, people keep some money in cash for spending and some money in bonds for investing. But when the interest rate on bonds falls to zero, people might as well keep all their money in cash.
2. What is a liquidity trap?
The notion goes back to British economist John Maynard Keynes in his path-breaking 1936 book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, and to Keynes’s interpreter, John Hicks. The liquidity trap is the inability of a central bank to stimulate economic growth through interest rate cuts. The goal is to stimulate spending by making borrowing cheaper and saving less attractive. The trap opens up when the public’s demand for goods and services is so weak that even an interest rate of zero fails to juice activity. In theory, a bank could have a bigger impact by cutting rates below zero – paying people and businesses to borrow. In practice, negative rates have turned out to be more complicated.
3. Why is that?
Because savers won’t tolerate them. If the interest rate paid on savings goes negative, it means that your money will shrink if you leave it in a savings account. The goal of negative rates is to spur you to spend the money now, which would be good for economic growth. But it also might cause you to take your money out of the bank and put it under a mattress or in a safe. Banks can’t operate if they lose all their deposits. Some key rates in Europe and Japan are below zero, but only slightly. In the U.S., the law that created the Federal Reserve may not allow the Fed to lower rates below zero, according to some interpretations, and Fed officials have said they’re not interested in the idea.
4. How low are rates now?
Rock bottom. In the U.S. the target range for the federal funds rate, which is the interest that banks charge each other for overnight loans of reserves, was 2.25% to 2.5% in July 2019 when the Federal Reserve began reducing it. To fight the effects of the coronavirus shutdown, the Fed cut the target range by 1.5 percentage points in two emergency meetings in March alone, bringing it back to its floor of zero to 0.25%.
5. What’s dangerous about a liquidity trap?
If low interest rates can’t stimulate people to spend enough to keep the workforce at full employment, the risk is that a liquidity trap will set off a deflationary spiral in which prices fall, causing people to delay spending, which makes prices fall even more, and so on down.
6. So is the U.S. stuck in a liquidity trap?
Not necessarily. The Federal Reserve has other ways of stimulating the economy, and it’s using all of them. It’s buying long-term bonds in order to lower long-term interest rates, the program known as quantitative easing. It’s steering market expectations with forward guidance, which is essentially a promise to keep rates low for a long time, even if that causes a jump in inflation. The Fed went even further in March 2020, announcing plans to provide direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.
7. Will that plan work?
Not alone. Congress will need to add stimulus by spending more or cutting taxes. That’s called fiscal policy. Fortunately, while monetary policy becomes less effective in a liquidity trap, fiscal policy becomes more effective. Interest rates don’t go up when the government spends more, so the new spending doesn’t “crowd out” private investment. It’s a pure plus for growth. It won’t prevent a recession, but combined with the Fed’s aggressive actions, it should shorten the length of time the economy is stuck in a liquidity trap."

Now the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and some of their counterparts are pledging to make a seemingly infinite ocean of money available to economies reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. In the process, they’re expanding their traditional role as lenders of last resort to the financial system, promising support not only to lenders and investors but to businesses large and small and even to individuals. Markets breathed sighs of relief, though some worried about whether such extraordinary interventions could create an inflation shock further down the road.
1. Why the change?
Because of the depth of the economic threat posed by the pandemic, and the weakness in this instance of the traditional tool of central banking, interest rate cuts. The Fed tried that, bringing its main interest rate back to near zero, through two sets of emergency cuts in March. The People’s Bank of China reduced the interest rate it charges on loans to banks by the biggest amount since 2015. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan already have rates that are below zero. But traditional monetary tools did not seem like enough.
2. Why didn’t that work?
Slashing interest rates usually works by making spending by companies and households more attractive. But it isn’t the best kind of medicine to treat economies that are facing both a “supply” and a “demand” shock. That is, cheaper borrowing costs won’t do much for factories that are starved of materials, or help locked-down consumers return to shopping or eating out.
3. What are central banks doing besides rate cuts?
Everything they can. The Fed, for instance, reignited and expanded bond-buying programs from the 2008 financial crisis, while moving quickly to inject $1 trillion of liquidity to the system in recent weeks, with untold billions still to come. Central banks are also coordinating or acting in consultation with their governments, as legislatures jump in with trillions of dollars in so-called fiscal spending and stimulus plans, including a U.S. plan to send a check to every adult for $1,200, subject to income limits.
4. What’s the big idea?
Buying time, in two ways. Interventions in the financial markets were meant to keep credit markets from freezing up by having the central bank offer itself as a willing buyer of good assets. For the same reason, the Fed expanded its liquidity swaps for other central banks around the world three times to ease a global scramble for U.S. dollars that threatened to upend currency markets. But the broader lending programs were meant to buy time for not just for the markets but for the larger economy, to tide companies and individuals over until the lockdowns forced by the pandemic are eased and business activity resumes.
5. Why so much bond-buying?
Born in the 2008 crisis, the once unconventional idea of making huge bond purchases to nudge down long-term rates -- quantitative easing -- is now an established part of the central banks’ armory. Yet the strategy is being used for somewhat different purposes this time. For one thing, QE is seen as less effective when long-term rates are already low, as they are now. But bond buying is also a way of being a lender of last resort, which is why the Fed and other banks are expanding purchases beyond government and corporate bonds. For instance, the Fed looks poised to gain the unprecedented power to buy municipal bonds. And the Bank of Japan is buying exchange-tradedfunds, as part of an effort to stabilize financial markets. In mid-March the BOJ doubled its target for net purchases to 12 trillion yen ($112 billion). The ECB had resumed its bond purchases in 2019 and expanded it as the virus began to take a toll; other central banks have indicated they would be prepared to take similar steps in the face of weakness.
6. What other new lending are central banks doing?
In their expanded role as the ultimate bridge lender, central banks are rolling out a laundry list of programs.
• China’s central bank is extending 800 billion yuan ($115 billion) of cheaper loans to support smaller and private companies.
• The ECB was considering how it might support banks through its long-term lending program.
• The Fed is letting banks borrow from the discount window for as long as 90 days and is even extending lending to non-bank borrowers through two new emergency programs.
• The BOJ announced one-year loans at 0% to banks that pledge corporate debt as collateral.
7. How are they supporting financial markets?
The spiral of bad news about the pandemic and the economic upheaval that came with it led to widespread asset sales, as investors sought safer places for their money. Central banks around the world stepped in to prevent a vicious circle, in which difficulties obtaining credit led to more panicked selling.
• The Fed responded to signs of strain in markets for Treasury bonds and repurchase agreements by offering a cumulative $5 trillion in lending, in a signal that the bank was ready to do whatever it takes to keep short-term financing rates from spiking.
• The Fed also revived programs from the 2008 financial crisis that allowed it to buy mortgage and asset-backed securities alongside other securities from big banks and broker-dealers licensed to transact with the Fed. Another new facility allows the Fed to purchase high-quality assets from U.S. money market mutual funds.
• The ECB enhanced a loan program with terms that effectively amount to an interest-rate cut for banks that use it to pump money into the economy.
• The PBOC injected $14.3 billion of one-year funding into the financial system and trimmed the amount of cash some lenders have to hold in reserve, while leaving interest rates unchanged.
• Australia boosted cash injections and said it “stands ready” to purchase government bonds.
8. What else are they doing?
Easing up on some regulations, and asking others to ease up as well, in a practice known as forbearance. For instance, regulators in China have asked banks to be more lenient on bad loans. In the U.S., the Fed is reducing reserve requirement ratios to 0%, meaning banks can lend more aggressively without protest from regulators. China has waived requirements for smaller companies to pay into the social security system from February to June. The rate of value-added tax for smaller companies has also been reduced temporarily to 1% from 3% between March and May.
9. What are the risks?
To some observers, this massive infusion of money will inevitably lead to inflation later. Others worry about the erosion of central bank independence that may come from actions that in some cases could be seen as effectively nationalizing parts of the economy. Others see central banks as rightly focused on the unprecedented challenges the pandemic raises. Keeping lenders lending and businesses afloat for the next few months could be the difference between a steep recession and a depression, they say."

Everyone loves Tito.
And Armando, the pizza maker, they couldn’t let him go, he’s got the technique down to perfection.
But every day, Mike Juliano has to make some wrenching decisions if he’s going to pull his family restaurant in Northern Virginia through this. How do you go from 20 employees to five full time? Whom do you keep?
“It’s been 43 years,” Juliano said, after another exhausting day at Rocco’s Italian Restaurant in McLean. “I’ve been busing tables here since I was 8 years old. This can’t be the end. No way.”
He’s the third generation of Juliano men with the middle name Rocco to run the family-style Italian restaurant: Nonna’s recipes from the old country, established with their life savings in 1977, the whole American Dream story.
And the past few years have been rough for Rocco’s. The glitzy, glam shopping universe growing nearby is offering of-the-moment restaurants that have little to do with Rocco’s sturdy baked ziti and red-checkered tabletops.
“The margins have been running a little thin anyways. We’ve been fighting all these corporate places. It’s hard to survive,” said Juliano, who launched a GoFundMe fundraiser, as scores of businesses have, to try to pay his employees. “And for this to happen.”
It’s the story of small businesses across America, particularly restaurants, salons, barbers, dry cleaners, cobblers and bookstores.
Those places that have been around forever — the joint that hosted the soccer team victory party, grad night dinner with the grandparents — are in peril. The black-owned barber shop that has been an anchor in a community. The immigrant restaurant named for the year they made it to America.
And what about the I’ve-always-wanted-to places — the indie bookstore opened by someone who took a leap off the corporate treadmill, the coffee house opened by someone leaving the churn of politics, the mead brewery opened by a home brewer who finally thought the kids were old enough for him to pursue his dream.
It’s an American economic and cultural tragedy waiting to happen. And it simply can’t. And I believe it won’t. Here’s why.
“I honestly am humbled by how much people love us,” Juliano said. “I thought they hated us. You know, not hated. But all the competition, and business was going down. But now? The tips we’re getting when people pick up food and the memories they’re telling us about. It’s really humbling.”
While they wait for federal, state and local aid packages that could save them, small businesses are pivoting, scraping, retooling and working to survive this brutal spring.
And maybe, the soul-searching of how-can-I-help Americans who’ve been seduced by shiny places and sleek chains will see the power they have to save an important piece of our communities. The small-business owners are continuing to inspire us with that American spirit we say we love.
Let’s go back to Maryland Meadworks. I know the family through hockey, and watched Ken Carter and Rumi Matsuyama work to open their little place in Hyattsville offering honey brew and jazz nights. How would a business this young survive a complete shutdown, just as they were getting their legs under them?
Meet the MeadMaiden. After finishing her workday, Matsuyama gets on her bike and delivers growlers of mead to customers across Hyattsville. I love this.
Another one of my favorites is my little nerd paradise on Capitol Hill called Labyrinth Game Shop. When Kathleen Donahue first opened it 10 years ago, I was delighted to have a place to take my young kids for games and puzzles. But honestly, I thought she was out of her mind, starting a specialty business like this in the Amazon era.
And she pivoted quickly to do more than stack games on her shelves. She created a gaming universe, hiring game geeks who knew everything about the crazy array of games she had. She created game camps and sent her game geeks to run after-school programs in local schools (my younger son was a proud participant). She held game nights at her store, hosted birthday parties. Not long ago, when we were there to buy a gift for someone, she busted through the wall to expand her store into the space next door.
And now, this.
When the coronavirus began shutting the city down, Labyrinth provided curbside game pickup. A perfect business plan for quarantine! Because really, who’s going to survive if all you’ve got is Monopoly and Risk?
But then, another blow. Labyrinth had to shut down the curbside delivery once the District ordered all nonessential businesses to close.
“I feel like my life has completely changed in the span of 30 days,” she wrote on her Facebook page. When we talked, she was gathering the old tax documents she has to submit to get small-business government assistance.
“The all encompassing fear and stress that has become a daily norm is overwhelming,” she said. “I’m scared for my family, my friends, my customers, and mostly my employees. I’m tired and depressed. On Thursday, I had to basically close down my business that I’ve worked every day for the last 10 years to build. I am hopeful that we will make it through, but it doesn’t help the knot I have in my stomach or the tension in my back and shoulders.”
I told her how important her business has been to our family and I bought a gift card. She’s going to start virtual gaming sessions, she’s encouraging folks to sign up for summer camps, and she’s trying to start delivering games to customers. She’s pivoting, yet again.
This is how she will survive, how Rocco’s will survive, how all small businesses buffeted by wars and recessions and terrorist attacks and fads and fickle customers have survived.

It’s a source of cash relief to households, the unemployed and hospitals; it’s funding for private-sector loans from the Federal Reserve and Small Business Administration; it’s a lifeline for airlines and other strategic industries.
And, yes, it’s a political transaction, greased by favors for constituencies as different as the Kennedy Center and the sunscreen industry.
Fundamentally, though, it’s a colossal act of social solidarity, a massive, across-the-board commitment of the nation’s wealth, premised, as its acronym implies, on the idea that everyone needs help in a crisis for which no one is at fault.
This is an extraordinary, potentially precedent-setting, moment in the history of a country where social solidarity has not always been the norm. But what kind of precedent, specifically?
There are admirable reasons for the United States’ comparative lack of social solidarity — a traditional ethos of individual freedom and entrepreneurship — and not-so-admirable ones, such as white supremacy, racism and other forms of discrimination.
What’s undeniable, though, is that our social insurance and economic stabilization mechanisms have been generally less developed than those of Europe, where nations’ relative ethnic homogeneity, among other factors, fostered solidarity.
In this country, war, especially two world wars in the 20th century, served as a — highly imperfect — catalyst for such solidarity as we did establish.
Even the Great Society’s expansion of the social safety net in the 1960s can be seen as a response to international conflict, to disprove Cold War-era Soviet propaganda about the brutality of capitalism.
Our safety net today, a hodgepodge of programs for which people qualify based on membership in a particular category — veterans, the elderly, poor children and so on — reflects the episodic nature of its construction. A deep-seated American concept is that people “deserve” benefits based not on membership in society per se, but because they have in some sense “earned” or “qualified” for them.
Moral hazard, the idea that insuring people makes them more likely to engage in risky or unproductive behavior, has been repeatedly invoked — sometimes honestly, sometimes hypocritically — to limit the social safety net.
The Cares Act, then, is doubly new: It dramatically expands the domestic role of government without the justification of war, and it does so with relatively little concern for moral hazard.
A group of Republican senators objected to disincentives to work in the bill’s beefed-up unemployment benefits. Progressives such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) railed against aid for corporations.
In the end, though, the bill passed without a single recorded “no” vote, as Republicans and Democrats across the ideological spectrum realistically embraced the idea that some risks are so catastrophic, so hard to foresee and so threatening to the nation as a whole, that they must be addressed collectively.
For Democrats, the ideological concession that the private sector, including big business, should be helped, not punished, is non-trivial. It pales in comparison, however, with the retreat by Republicans, who were forced to acknowledge, openly, that there are certain circumstances in which free-market principles do not apply.
This tentative consensus is now a matter of record, and could be the beginning of a new and distinctly American kind of social solidarity, based not on the ethnic character of the state, as in Europe, or on various forms of categorical eligibility, as in the current U.S. safety net.
Rather, the criterion would be the common humanity of a diverse nation, whose citizens are all susceptible to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune — including, but not limited to, pandemic viruses.
When normality returns, we need to focus more resources on difficult-to-insure risks that all people face, through no fault of their own — old age, illness, unemployment, natural disaster — and recognize that government is best positioned to protect against them. It is outrageous that the United States arrived at its second economic crash within a dozen years still possessed of an outdated state-by-state system of unemployment insurance, and that health insurance still follows employment for most of the non-elderly population.
Meanwhile, we could focus fewer government resources on protecting private companies and individuals against risks they assume voluntarily, and can learn how to manage if they don’t already know. That could mean, for example, reducing agribusiness subsidies and streamlining the panoply of federal tax breaks and financial backing for the single-family home industry.
One reason the Cares Act requires the United States to borrow so much while devising new programs on the fly is that it has heretofore done such a poor job of defining government’s essential and nonessential functions, wasting billions on the latter while neglecting the former.
The bill will have been worth its price, however, if its spirit of realistic solidarity proves both lasting and clarifying."

Megachurches in Ohio and Florida also reported their halls teeming with congregants. In Virginia, Liberty University last week welcomed back from spring break some 1,900 of students to its Lynchburg campus. These foolhardy, irresponsible decisions endanger not just those who attended the church services or resumed their college studies but untold others who now run the risk of the novel coronavirus being passed on to them and their families.
Efforts to stop the spread of the highly contagious disease, which medical experts warn could kill 100,000 to 200,000 Americans, have prompted a reordering of public life. Schools, businesses and local governments have shut as growing numbers of officials — as well as much of the public — take to heart the advice of public health professionals about avoiding gatherings and practicing social isolation.
Unfortunately, some don’t believe the scientific evidence or don’t think it applies to them. “It’s not a concern,” the pastor at Life Tabernacle Church said of the chance of infection. “The virus, we believe, is politically motivated. We hold our religious rights dear, and we are going to assemble no matter what someone says.” Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr., who has blamed the media for hyping the threat of covid-19 to damage President Trump, framed his decision to reopen the evangelical college as a favor for students. “I think we have a responsibility to our students — who paid to be here, who want to be here, who love it here — to give them the ability to be with their friends, to continue their studies, enjoy the room and board they’ve already paid for and to not interrupt their college life,” he told the (Lynchburg) News & Advance.
More on point was a student who told the New York Times: “I’m not allowed to talk to you because I’m an employee here . . . we need help to go home.” Or that of a Liberty parent who wrote on Twitter “I’m as right wing as they get, bud. But as a parent of three of your students, I think this is crazy, irresponsible.” The Times on Monday reported that about a dozen students “were sick with symptoms that suggested covid-19.” Mr. Falwell disputed the numbers, but his rebuttal included disclosure about a student “from an out-of-state county with a high number of cases who was running a fever and had a cough. He was tested and advised to self-isolate pending the results. He elected to return to his permanent residence instead.”
Most people are doing their best to follow the rules — in most churches, colleges and everywhere else. They shouldn’t be put at risk by the reckless actions of a few."

We can save lives, or maximize gross domestic product.
But if you listen to economists, you’ll learn that this is a false choice. Prematurely reopening businesses, schools and public gatherings — as Trump has agitated to do — would be worse for long-run economic growth than requiring them to remain closed until the virus is contained.
Last week, Trump and his National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, complained that the “cure” to this pandemic — that is, our collective economic coma — might “be worse than the disease.” Right-wing news organizations echoed this complaint, sometimes appallingly implying that Grandpa should be sacrificed to juice GDP.
After widespread pushback from public health experts, Trump gave in, and on Sunday extended social distancing guidance through the end of April. Still, he appeared to want credit for making the supposedly bold choice to set aside U.S. economic interests (and by implication, his political interests) to save lives.
In fact, there’s near-unanimity among economists that the best way to limit economic damage would be to listen to the public health experts’ advice about how to limit infections — including by continued dramatic social distancing measures.
This should make sense.
If the virus is not contained, customers will be afraid to shop, travel and dine out, even without mandatory lockdowns. Or, as Harvard economics professor Lawrence H. Summers wrote in The Post recently: “It is an elementary confusion to believe that lost growth and lost jobs are primarily a consequence of social distancing measures rather than the pandemic itself.”
In other words, the demand-side shock would continue, even without forced business closures. So, too, would the supply-side shock. After all, Americans won’t be able to work if they’re sick. They definitely won’t be able to work if they’re dead.
Funny thing about our economy, that: Until the robots take over, we still need healthy workers to produce stuff.
Don’t take my word for it.
In a recent University of Chicago IGM Economic Experts Panel survey, 80 percent agreed that “Abandoning severe lockdowns at a time when the likelihood of a resurgence in infections remains high will lead to greater total economic damage than sustaining the lockdowns to eliminate the resurgence risk.” Not a single economist surveyed disagreed with the statement; remaining respondents instead said they were “uncertain.”
A bipartisan group of high-profile economists and former economic policymakers likewise signed onto a recent letter reading in part: “Saving lives and saving the economy are not in conflict right now; we will hasten the return to robust economic activity by taking steps to stem the spread of the virus and save lives.”
These conclusions are informed by both theoretical models and historical data.
Theoretical work by Martin Eichenbaum and Sergio Rebelo (of Northwestern University) and Mathias Trabandt (of Freie Universitat Berlin) finds that, in the short term, there does appear to be a trade-off between economic activity and health outcomes. That is, the containment measures required to limit the spread of the coronavirus would result in a sharp initial recession. But over the long run, an optimal containment strategy would reduce economic costs, largely because it preserves the lives of workers needed to keep the economy running.
That is, not shuttering businesses would be more expensive for society than strategically shuttering them.
Historical research on the 1918 flu, by Sergio Correia (Federal Reserve Board), Stephan Luck (Federal Reserve Bank of New York) and Emil Verner (MIT) backs this up.
Their new working paper finds that “cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively” through school closures, bans on public gathering, isolation and quarantine did better economically post-pandemic than cities with a more laissez-faire approach.
Economists, by the way, have also found ways to quantify the value of saved lives above and beyond whatever might be measured by wages or productivity.
A new paper from Michael Greenstone and Vishan Nigam, both of the University of Chicago, estimates that moderate social distancing would save 1.7 million (!) lives in the next six months, an astronomical number largely due to not overwhelming hospital systems. This translates to about $8 trillion in economic benefits — equivalent to more than a third of GDP, and more than the size of the entire annual federal budget — when monetized through a standard measure used by the U.S. government called the value of a statistical life.
Economists as a rule are hypersensitive to trade-offs, which are, arguably, the fundamental premise of their discipline. When virtually the entire profession shouts from the rooftops that there are no trade-offs here — and that two critical societal priorities are aligned — we should listen."

“We are taking it on at very low interest rates,” Bullard said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee on Monday via telephone from St. Louis, noting that rates will “probably stay very low for quite a while.”
“It is a big country. We can carry 10% more debt. It is not ideal but we can certainly do it. And if there was ever a time where you wanted to do something like this, now is that time.”
President Donald Trump on Friday signed a $2 trillion fiscal package to protect the economy as American households and businesses hunker down from the spreading virus. On Sunday he warned the nation that 100,000 or more may may die as the White House extended guidelines on “social distancing” until April 30.
The Fed has slashed interest rates to almost zero and pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into credit markets to ensure they continue to function and tide the economy over as it endures the pandemic.
Surging Unemployment
Bullard, who has estimated the jobless rate would rise to around 30% and GDP output would halve in the second quarter, said there is much uncertainty around that estimate.
Unemployment -- which matched a 50-year low of 3.5% in February -- could surge to at least 10% or go as high as 42%, he said. That’s based on the number of workers in industries vulnerable to virus-related shutdowns in which people work in close contact with each other, such as restaurants, hotels and many other service businesses.
Much depends on how many businesses retain workers by taking advantage of federal pandemic relief programs to ensure they keep their workers on the payroll for when the crisis is over, Bullard said.
By laying off employees, “they might lose the connection with their workers,” he said. By applying for forgivable Small Business Administration loans, “you might be able to retain all of your workers and then when the startup occurs later, you will be able to have the same workers and you do not have to hire all over again.
“If companies decide to do that, we will see lower unemployment and more uptake” on small-business loans."
"March 31, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-6040-investment-portfolio-should-expand-its-borders/2020/03/30/071e25ac-726e-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,The 60/40 Investment Portfolio Should Expand Its Borders,"The traditional 60/40 portfolio of U.S. stocks and bonds isn’t dead, but it has fallen on hard times. U.S. interest rates are hovering around zero and, even after a coronavirus-induced sell-off, the U.S. stock market isn’t cheap. For adherents of 60/40, it’s a good time to revisit some old assumptions.  
When in doubt, tradition has it, investors should put 60% of their portfolios in U.S. stocks and 40% in bonds. Why 60/40? There’s no satisfying answer. A common explanation is that stocks can be expected to outpace bonds over time, so tilting the portfolio in favor of stocks is an easy way to reach for extra return without excessive risk. And why the U.S.? Well, there’s no place like home.
That tradition has paid off. A 60/40 combination of the S&P 500 Index and long-term U.S. government bonds has returned 8.9% a year from 1926 to 2019, including dividends, or 6% a year after inflation. The results were even better during the last decade. The 60/40 portfolio returned 12.6% a year from 2010 to 2019, or 10.5% a year after inflation.
Past isn’t prologue, however, and that admonition has never been more fitting for 60/40 portfolios. A widely cited barometer of real expected returns from stocks is the cyclically adjusted earnings yield, which uses an average of inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years. That yield for the S&P 500 Index is 4.8%, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, the yield on inflation-protected Treasuries is a negative 0.2%. A 60/40 combination of the two produces an expected return of 2.8% a year after inflation. 
Investors don’t appear to have grasped that reality. In its most recent annual investor survey, French lender Natixis SA reported that U.S. investors expect their portfolios to generate returns of 10.9% a year after inflation. To put that delusion in perspective, the 60/40 U.S. portfolio managed to equal or surpass that mark just 9% of the time since 1926 over rolling 10-year periods, counted monthly. And those periods were all clustered around the 1990s, a decade with an enchanted combination of bond yields that fell from record highs and stock valuations that climbed to records. Suffice it so say, no one expects those tailwinds to return soon.
Those who want a preview of what the next decade might look like should consider the recent experience of investors in other developed countries. Home bias, or the propensity to invest in one’s home country, is common to all investors. A recent paper by FTSE Russell examined euro zone home bias in equity allocations from 2008 to September 2019. It found, for example, that French pension funds invested 88% of their equity portfolios in French companies, which is 29 times France’s weight in the FTSE All-World Index. In Spain, the equity allocation of pension funds to local companies was 67 times the country’s weight in the FTSE index.
Staying home paid off for a time. The MSCI French Index outpaced the MSCI All Country World Index, or ACWI, by 2.6 percentage points a year in euros from 1999 to 2007, including dividends, the earliest year for which numbers are available. And the MSCI Spain Index outpaced ACWI by 5.2 percentage points a year over the same period. 
But the cost of higher stock prices is lower earnings yields. By the end of 2007, the cyclically adjusted earnings yield was 4.2% in France and 3.7% in Spain. Since 2008, French stocks have returned 4% a year through February, lagging ACWI by 3.2 percentage points a year, and Spanish stocks have been flat, trailing ACWI by 7.3 percentage points a year.  
France and Spain are hardly alone. While the U.S. stock market has soared since the 2008 financial crisis, the rest of the world has floundered. The cyclically adjusted earnings yield of the MSCI World ex USA Index, a basket of companies in developed countries outside the U.S., has swelled to 6.5% from 4% at the end of 2007. Similarly, the yield for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has jumped to 7.2% from 3.8% over the same time. 
Value-minded investors can find even higher yields. The MSCI World ex USA Value Index offers an earnings yield of 9.5%, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Value Index packs a yield of 11%. If there’s ever a time for Americans to start leaving home, this is it.
It won’t be easy. Given 60/40’s stellar past performance, investors are more likely to look back than forward. Also, overseas stocks have been laggards for years and have only tumbled further over time — and nothing repels investors like falling stock prices. The timing isn’t great, either. Everyone wants the comforts of home during a crisis.
Unfortunately, there’s not much investors can do about the 40 because the U.S. still boasts some of the highest bond yields in the developed world. But when it comes to the 60, the value is overseas. So let’s tip our hat to the old 60/40 — and then give it an upgrade.

"March 31, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/03/31/understaffing-threatens-work-key-us-education-statistics-agency-experts-say/,The Washington Post,"Understaffing threatens work at key U.S. education statistics agency, experts say","There is growing concern in the education world that a severe staff shortage at the National Center for Education Statistics will force the agency to cut back on the collection and dissemination of vital data that the public, legislators and policymakers use to make decisions.
At a time when the coronavirus pandemic has brought into sharp focus the importance of good data (such as how many people are infected and how many schools are closed), the primary federal agency for collecting and analyzing education data will probably have to cut back or eliminate key statistical surveys, statisticians who used to work at the center and others say.
“I’m very concerned that this is something that has the potential to erode the quality of the education system,” said Larry Hedges, a world-renowned applied statistician who is chairman of Northwestern University’s Department of Statistics. He won the $3.9 million global Yidan Prize for Education Research in 2018.
“In the case of NCES, it is a trustworthy source of evidence about American education and no place else can provide that,” he said.
Included in the data instruments that could be compromised, experts say, are the School Survey on Crime and Safety, which is the primary source of school-level data on those subjects for the Education Department; the Fast Response Survey System, which could be used to help schools recover from the covid-19 crisis; and the National Assessment of Education Progress, called “America’s report card.""
Officials at the Education Department would not respond to queries about this issue, including NCES officials or Peggy Carr, associate commissioner of NCES’s Assessments Division, which is responsible for the NAEP, one of the agency’s projects that could be affected by the staffing problems.
NCES has long collected, analyzed and published objective, nonpartisan data from about 18,000 public school districts on many issues, including academic achievement, crime and school safety, school funding and spending, student and teacher demographics, and much more.
Its data is used by school boards, families and others to make individual and public decisions. For example, Daniel Elchert, a science policy fellow at the American Statistical Association, the largest community of statisticians in the world, wrote: “Imagine parents trying to make a decision about a new school district — but finding that the only available information is two years out of date. Or a local school board trying to select their curriculum and being informed that they’ll need to decide without any actual data.”
“The concerns about diminished resources for data, data reporting, and staff reductions are real and troublesome for NCES,” said Felice Levine, executive director of the American Educational Research Association.
The agency has sustained staff cuts for decades, increasingly contracting work out to private companies, which can do some of the work to keep the statistical analyses going but not all of it.
A group of former agency commissioners and others have sent a letter (see below) to Congress to provide enough funding and guidance so that the agency can rebuild its staff, and to reject a Trump administration proposal to reduce the stature of NCES in other ways.
Levine signed the letter, along with Ron Wasserstein, executive director of the American Statistical Association; Katherine Wallman, chief statistician of the United States from 1992-2017; Emerson Elliott, NCES commissioner from 1984-1995; Jack Buckley, NCES commissioner from 2009-2013; and Nancy Potok, chief statistician of the United States, from 2017-2019.
It asks for at least a 5 percent budget increase in NCES’s statistics account, noting that it has lost more than 20 percent in purchasing power since fiscal 2009. The extra money, the letter said, would be used in part to help NCES track emerging education trends and provide more timely and regional data, “efforts that are currently taxed due to both the loss of the agency’s purchasing power and its staffing crisis.”
Contractors cannot make fundamental decisions about what data should be collected to help inform the public and policymakers, they said. The work is spread out among various contractors, and there needs to be a strong core of full-time agency employees who can look at the data collections in their entirety, statisticians say.
Currently, NCES’s $260 million statistics and assessment budget is managed by nearly 90 full-time employees — even though there is not supposed to be fewer than 95, Elchert said.
Other statistical agencies within the federal government have had more success building staff, with smaller budgets but more full-time employees. For example, the U.S. Agriculture Department’s National Agricultural Statistics Service has a $170 million budget but more than 1,000 full-time employees, Elchert said. Per every $1 million in budget, the agricultural statistics service has 16 times more staff than NCES. (You can see a chart with more comparisons below.)
The letter also urges Congress to reject an effort by the Trump administration to transfer NCES’s assessment responsibilities to a new center and dropping a requirement that the commissioner of the agency by appointed by the president. Buckley said that the proposed “demotion in stature” of the agency “is particularly bad” because statistical agencies within the government are expected to ramp up efforts now to remain compliant with federal data laws.
According to Elchert and others, these are some of surveys at risk:
The Condition of Education, which is congressionally mandated and provides key indicators at all levels, from prekindergarten through postsecondary, as well as labor-force outcomes and international comparisons;
The NAEP, a national assessment known as the nation’s report card because it is the only exam that measures what U.S. students know and can do in various subjects across the nation, states and in some urban districts;
School Survey on Crime and Safety, which is the primary source of school-level data on crime and safety for the U.S. Education Department;
National Teacher and Principal Survey, which provides data on education workforce and teachers'/principals’ salaries as well as descriptive data on the context of elementary and secondary education, such as the characteristics of principals, teachers and students;
Middles Grades Longitudinal Study, which measures middle school academic achievement and student success. and is the first study to follow a nationally representative sample of students as they move through the middle grades;
National Household Education Survey Program, which looks at data around prekindergarten, home schooling, adult education and parent involvement, and is the flagship household survey of the NCES.
Here’s the letter sent to Congress:

The trouble is that they’re in far worse shape than in 2008, when a government-mandated lending boom helped revive growth. That’s why a cut in the deposit rate is long overdue.
The People’s Bank of China is in discussions to lower the interest rate banks pay on deposits for the first time since 2015 and a decision could be announced within days, the Financial Times reported last week, citing people familiar with the deliberations. A reduction would shore up banks’ profitability, buying lenders breathing room as authorities lean on them to support companies that are struggling to stay afloat after a shutdown that affected two-thirds of the economy.
It can’t come a moment too soon. The government is pushing banks to extend relief by rolling over debts, lowering loan rates and keeping credit lines open. It has allowed them to refrain from collecting interest from virus-affected companies until June 30 and has loosened the criteria for classifying loans as nonperforming. To encourage lending, regulators have also reduced the percentage of deposits that lenders must lodge with the central bank, known as the required reserve ratio.
All these measures will increase pressure on a state-controlled banking system that is already undercapitalized and having its net interest margins squeezed. What will really help is a reduction in banks’ funding costs. While the rate on demand deposits is a puny 0.35%, the amount paid on time deposits is far higher — as much as 1.5% on sums locked up for one year.
On Monday, the PBOC reduced the interest rate that it charges on loans to commercial banks by the most in five years. The seven-day reverse repurchase rate was cut to 2.2% from 2.4%. While that lowers funding costs, it also signals an impending reduction in lending rates. Analysts say a cut in the central bank’s medium-term lending facility rate, its main policy tool, isn’t far away. That in turn will influence the loan prime rate, set by 18 banks once a month.
Smaller banks — outside the big four of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. — will be the biggest beneficiaries of lower rates for time deposits. These account for a large portion of customer accounts at lenders such as Bank of Communications Co. and Ping An Bank Co., according to to CGS-CIMB Securities Ltd. analyst Michael Chang. Such banks have more small and medium-size enterprises among their loan clients and also lend out more of their deposits.
Even the big four could do with some relief. While they’re better capitalized and more profitable than the rest, they bear the burden of being the government’s principal policy tool, requiring them to hand out low-interest loans and help out struggling smaller banks
The bigger question is how much difference even lower deposit rates will make given the scale of the challenge the economy faces. A prolonged health emergency will cause the nonperforming loan ratio to triple to 6.3%, S&P Global Inc. estimates.
In 2008, China’s banks were still flush from recapitalizations and initial public offerings conducted earlier in the decade, and their shares were trading above book value. Now, most are at discounts: Bank of China’s Hong Kong-listed stock trades at a price-to-book ratio of less than half. At the same time, the financial system has ballooned in size and leverage has soared. The ratio of debt to gross domestic product jumped to 276% at the end of 2018 from 162% at the end of 2008, according to Bloomberg Economics.
China’s banks “make just enough in profits to keep pace with growth and keep capital ratios stable so they can’t afford to do a lot more than they’re doing now,” said Grace Wu, Fitch Ratings head of Greater China bank ratings.
Regulators could relax capital ratios at mid-size lenders such as China Minsheng Banking Corp. and China Guangfa Bank Co. Still, that would risk storing up bigger problems down the road. Consumer defaults are already piling up, with overdue credit-card debt swelling last month to 50% from a year earlier. Qudian Inc., a Beijing-based online lender, said its delinquency ratio jumped to 20% in February from 13% at the end of last year.
Cutting deposit rates also punishes consumers, the very people the government needs to help get the economy back up and running. Lower rates could also compound banks’ challenges by encouraging depositors to pull out money, though a crackdown on shadow banking has reduced the range of alternatives.
There are no easy answers. Whatever their limitations or unwanted side effects, the need to keep banks in some semblance of health suggests lower deposit rates are coming soon."

China has also been making it easier for foreigners to buy its stocks and bonds — something many fund managers are required to do now that major index compilers are including Chinese assets in their gauges, to the dismay of some U.S. politicians. Financial regulators in Beijing say the liberalization drive will continue. The take-up is gathering pace but the going has been tough, even before the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
1. What’s the change?
China is allowing full foreign ownership of life insurers, futures and mutual fund companies this year -- in stages. Foreign ownership caps for securities firms come off April 1 as part of the trade agreement signed with the U.S. in January. China also pledged to take no longer than 90 days to decide on applications from electronic-payment service providers, including for wholly foreign-owned operations. Regulators cleared the way for full takeovers of local banks by foreigners in 2019, a year after it eased ownership caps. Foreign companies can now also be lead underwriters for all types of bonds, and can control wealth management firms, pension fund managers and inter-dealer brokers. The Shanghai-London Stock Connect officially kicked off in June 2019, allowing companies listed on one bourse to trade shares on the other. (Almost a year later, however, only a single company had taken advantage of it.) An earlier program linked Hong Kong with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.
2. Who’s diving in?
Quite a few companies:
3. What’s the lure?
China’s $45 trillion financial services industry. Even a sliver can be lucrative. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that -- barring a major economic slowdown or change of course -- foreign banks and securities companies could be raking in profits of more than $9 billion a year in China by 2030. Wealth management firms are looking at a market poised to reach $30 trillion in assets by 2023, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman. Guo Shuqing, China’s chief banking regulator, sees significant room for foreign investors: They held just 1.6% of banking assets and 5.8% of the insurance market as of May 2019, he said. The percentages have fluctuated over the years. In 2007, for example, the foreign share of Chinese banking assets was 2.3%.
4. What barriers remain?
The threat of financial decoupling looms with the Trump administration looking at restrictions on U.S. investments in Chinese companies and financial markets, a possible new front in the trade war. (China declared it would continue to open markets and encourage foreign investment.) There are also plenty of hidden barriers, including the challenge of cracking a market dominated by government-controlled rivals that have longstanding relationships with clients. The lengthy and often opaque application process also can be a deterrence. Visa, for example, has been waiting since 2015. On top of all that, China is expected to see the slowest economic growth in more than 40 years in 2020 as the world struggles with the pandemic.
5. What about stocks and bonds?
They’re being slowly added to widely followed global benchmarks, including stock indexes by MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell and, for bonds, the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and JPMorgan’s GBI-EM indexes. That’s expected to draw tens of billions of dollars in purchases initially from funds that track those gauges.
6. How’s that going?
Bumpy. In late 2019 MSCI said it wouldn’t add any more yuan-denominated shares until China fixed long-standing concerns over market access. And not every opening is met with enthusiasm: Foreign investors had bought only a third of the total allotment at the time regulators scrapped the quota system for Chinese stocks and bonds in September. Market turbulence in recent years, including major stock sell-offs, has dampened interest. Some investors also worry about being unable to repatriate their money due to China’s capital controls. (The government has long kept a tight grip on money flowing in and out so as to preserve the value of its currency, the yuan.)
7. What’s in it for China?
The benefits may be twofold: U.S. President Donald Trump accuses China of being a one-sided beneficiary of global commerce, so opening up makes the trade seem more balanced. And Chinese leaders have long described the moves as a useful way to improve the competitiveness of the domestic industry -- without challenging its dominance -- as well as to allocate capital more efficiently and attract foreign investment. Central bank governor Yi Gang has described the moves as “prudent, cautious, gradualist.”"
"March 31, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-its-a-new-unlimited-world-for-central-banks/2020/03/30/bd5c8944-728c-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,"Why It’s a New, ‘Unlimited’ World for Central Banks","It’s a concept that would have been hard to imagine being adopted in the history of central banking, at least before last week: unlimited bond-buying. Now the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and some of their counterparts are pledging to make a seemingly infinite ocean of money available to economies reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. In the process, they’re expanding their traditional role as lenders of last resort to the financial system, promising support not only to lenders and investors but to businesses large and small and even to individuals. Markets breathed sighs of relief, though some worried about whether such extraordinary interventions could create an inflation shock further down the road.
1. Why the change?
Because of the depth of the economic threat posed by the pandemic, and the weakness in this instance of the traditional tool of central banking, interest rate cuts. The Fed tried that, bringing its main interest rate back to near zero, through two sets of emergency cuts in March. The People’s Bank of China reduced the interest rate it charges on loans to banks by the biggest amount since 2015. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan already have rates that are below zero. But traditional monetary tools did not seem like enough.
2. Why didn’t that work?
Slashing interest rates usually works by making spending by companies and households more attractive. But it isn’t the best kind of medicine to treat economies that are facing both a “supply” and a “demand” shock. That is, cheaper borrowing costs won’t do much for factories that are starved of materials, or help locked-down consumers return to shopping or eating out.
3. What are central banks doing besides rate cuts?
Everything they can. The Fed, for instance, reignited and expanded bond-buying programs from the 2008 financial crisis, while moving quickly to inject $1 trillion of liquidity to the system in recent weeks, with untold billions still to come. Central banks are also coordinating or acting in consultation with their governments, as legislatures jump in with trillions of dollars in so-called fiscal spending and stimulus plans, including a U.S. plan to send a check to every adult for $1,200, subject to income limits.
4. What’s the big idea?
Buying time, in two ways. Interventions in the financial markets were meant to keep credit markets from freezing up by having the central bank offer itself as a willing buyer of good assets. For the same reason, the Fed expanded its liquidity swaps for other central banks around the world three times to ease a global scramble for U.S. dollars that threatened to upend currency markets. But the broader lending programs were meant to buy time for not just for the markets but for the larger economy, to tide companies and individuals over until the lockdowns forced by the pandemic are eased and business activity resumes.
5. Why so much bond-buying?
Born in the 2008 crisis, the once unconventional idea of making huge bond purchases to nudge down long-term rates -- quantitative easing -- is now an established part of the central banks’ armory. Yet the strategy is being used for somewhat different purposes this time. For one thing, QE is seen as less effective when long-term rates are already low, as they are now. But bond buying is also a way of being a lender of last resort, which is why the Fed and other banks are expanding purchases beyond government and corporate bonds. For instance, the Fed looks poised to gain the unprecedented power to buy municipal bonds. And the Bank of Japan is buying exchange-tradedfunds, as part of an effort to stabilize financial markets. In mid-March the BOJ doubled its target for net purchases to 12 trillion yen ($112 billion). The ECB had resumed its bond purchases in 2019 and expanded it as the virus began to take a toll; other central banks have indicated they would be prepared to take similar steps in the face of weakness.
6. What other new lending are central banks doing?
In their expanded role as the ultimate bridge lender, central banks are rolling out a laundry list of programs.
• China’s central bank is extending 800 billion yuan ($115 billion) of cheaper loans to support smaller and private companies.
• The ECB was considering how it might support banks through its long-term lending program.
• The Fed is letting banks borrow from the discount window for as long as 90 days and is even extending lending to non-bank borrowers through two new emergency programs.
• The BOJ announced one-year loans at 0% to banks that pledge corporate debt as collateral.
7. How are they supporting financial markets?
The spiral of bad news about the pandemic and the economic upheaval that came with it led to widespread asset sales, as investors sought safer places for their money. Central banks around the world stepped in to prevent a vicious circle, in which difficulties obtaining credit led to more panicked selling.
• The Fed responded to signs of strain in markets for Treasury bonds and repurchase agreements by offering a cumulative $5 trillion in lending, in a signal that the bank was ready to do whatever it takes to keep short-term financing rates from spiking.
• The Fed also revived programs from the 2008 financial crisis that allowed it to buy mortgage and asset-backed securities alongside other securities from big banks and broker-dealers licensed to transact with the Fed. Another new facility allows the Fed to purchase high-quality assets from U.S. money market mutual funds.
• The ECB enhanced a loan program with terms that effectively amount to an interest-rate cut for banks that use it to pump money into the economy.
• The PBOC injected $14.3 billion of one-year funding into the financial system and trimmed the amount of cash some lenders have to hold in reserve, while leaving interest rates unchanged.
• Australia boosted cash injections and said it “stands ready” to purchase government bonds.
8. What else are they doing?
Easing up on some regulations, and asking others to ease up as well, in a practice known as forbearance. For instance, regulators in China have asked banks to be more lenient on bad loans. In the U.S., the Fed is reducing reserve requirement ratios to 0%, meaning banks can lend more aggressively without protest from regulators. China has waived requirements for smaller companies to pay into the social security system from February to June. The rate of value-added tax for smaller companies has also been reduced temporarily to 1% from 3% between March and May.
9. What are the risks?
To some observers, this massive infusion of money will inevitably lead to inflation later. Others worry about the erosion of central bank independence that may come from actions that in some cases could be seen as effectively nationalizing parts of the economy. Others see central banks as rightly focused on the unprecedented challenges the pandemic raises. Keeping lenders lending and businesses afloat for the next few months could be the difference between a steep recession and a depression, they say."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) acknowledged Monday night that he has an “admittedly narrow path” to overtake Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential race, but he insisted he could still become the party’s nominee.
Sanders, who appeared on the “Late Night with Seth Meyers” show via Skype, has fallen behind Biden by 277 delegates in the suspended Democratic contest and would need to win more than 60 percent of those still up for grabs to catch the former vice president.
“It is admittedly a narrow path, but I would tell you, Seth, that there are a lot of people who are supporting me,” Sanders said. “We have a strong grass-roots movement who believe that we have got to stay in, in order to continue the fight to make the world know that we need Medicare-for-all, that we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, that we need paid family and medical leave . . . that we must address climate change and education.”
“Campaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,” he added. “So that’s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.”
With both Biden and Sanders largely sidelined by the coronavirus outbreak, Sanders said it is “a very, very strange time for me.”
“The campaign has been radically changed,” he said. “We can’t do rallies. We can’t get out and do door-to-door stuff, which is what we like to do.”
Sanders has faced calls from some party leaders to end his campaign and help the Democratic Party position itself for the November general election. But he has given no indication that he is preparing to do that.
He recently said he wants to debate Biden in April. His team announced it is expanding digital organizing efforts ahead of the New York primary, which on Saturday was moved from April 28 to June 23. And Sanders has signaled a strong desire to use his campaign megaphone to advocate for liberal policies.
During his 2016 bid, he remained in the race well past the point where he had a realistic chance of catching Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee, in the delegate count.
Sanders sought to use his standing in the race — and the prospect of an endorsement — to persuade Clinton to embrace some of his policy proposals on college tuition and health insurance.
In the 2020 race, Biden currently has 1,094 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, while Sanders has 817, according the The Washington Post’s latest tally."

Salisbury University, another Maryland state school, said it would be refunding 56 percent of some of the money collected for this semester.
Our granddaughter was accepted at six other universities with almost full scholarships at each. Her major is criminology and justice, and she thought U-Md. was best for her. Her mother graduated from Salisbury; her grandfather was raised in Salisbury. Despite having straight A’s in high school, she was offered no grants or scholarships from the University of Maryland. It is a hardship for her to go there. She is from a single-parent home.
Now the school is closed because of the novel coronavirus. President Trump signed the $2 trillion relief package Friday. And the U-Md. president said the school has too many expenses to refund students’ tuition money.
This isn’t a time to be making money off the backs of students. Surely this situation will be corrected immediately. It’s a good case for Congress, the White House and the paper to ask tough questions of the president of the University of Maryland."

Is It Enough?,"Five years ago, when Singapore last aimed for a budget shortfall anywhere near as large as the one announced Tuesday, it was mainly because the city-state wanted to press on with the airport’s fifth terminal — one that will only be ready in the 2030s. The goal of the stimulus this time around is not to improve a distant future, but to ward off a present danger.
The overall deficit will be  S$10.9 billion ($7.8 billion), Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said in his budget speech, a sharp jump from S$1.7 billion last year. At 2.1% of gross domestic product, it’s a bold number for a fiscally prudent government that even during the 2009 global financial crisis was barely S$800 million in the red. (It had planned for an S$8.7 billion shortfall, but the economy improved.)
By opening the public wallet wide, policymakers are signaling that they’re taking the economic consequences of the coronavirus at least as seriously as those emanating from a global financial contagion. 
For businesses, Singapore is setting aside S$4 billion, a much bigger reprisal of the S$230 million relief measures announced during the 2003 epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The planned measures include property-tax rebates, rental discounts and cheaper credit for tourism, aviation, retail, hospitality, food and taxi services -- industries that are already bleeding. To others, Heng offered a corporate-tax concession as well as government-supported wages and salary increases for lower-paid employees. The generous package, supplemented by a S$800 million boost to the aging country’s steadily growing health budget as well as S$1.6 billion of “care and support” cash directly for households, will also set the tone for rival Asian financial center Hong Kong’s annual budget due later this month.
Given its stronger tourism and supply-chain links to China, the center of the outbreak, Hong Kong will be expected to do more. An economic vulnerability scorecard drawn up by Nomura Research shows the territory to be the most exposed to the coronavirus outside of the mainland. Thailand and Singapore lie in close competition for the unenviable No. 2 position. And yet, Hong Kong doesn’t have Singapore’s fiscal firepower, which has been augmented over the years by bolstering the budget with part of the expected long-term returns of the sovereign wealth fund, GIC Pte, and the state investment firm, Temasek Holdings Pte.
Whether Singapore manages to hit its deficit target remains an open question. The 2015 gap narrowed to S$4 billion after initially being estimated at S$6.7 billion. Strip out the total S$4.5 billion investment in the airport and productivity that year, and the budget basically balanced.This time, the deficit is bloated by S$6 billion earmarked for a fund that will help Singaporeans absorb a higher cost of living when the 7% goods and services tax rises to 9%. It’s supposed to occur sometime between 2021 and 2025, though Heng ruled out a GST increase next year, learning a lesson perhaps from Japan’s mistimed consumption-tax increase last quarter, a self-induced mistake, as my colleague Daniel Moss describes it. 
Still, sparing people future pain may be as crucial as offering a palliative. This was expected to be the last budget before the ruling People’s Action Party next faces elections. Polls are due by April 2021 but are very likely to be held later this year once the health scare is contained. Singapore governments are constitutionally mandated to aim for a balanced budget in their five-year term. The current administration was fortuitously sitting on S$17 billion-plus in surpluses accumulated since 2016. The stockpile will come in handy to please voters and fight the virus."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-look-of-pandemic-is-in-everyones-eyes/2020/03/31/7e5aaad2-7390-11ea-a9bd-9f8b593300d0_story.html,The Washington Post,The look of pandemic is in everyone’s eyes,"Many years ago when I was a young mother, my toddler son vanished from sight when I turned my back for a few seconds to water some flowers. Frantic, I ran to the street and looked in both directions, shrieking his name.
Nothing, nowhere. How could this be?
A few seconds passed when a police car suddenly materialized.
“Did you lose your child?” the officer asked.
“Yes,” I nearly screamed. “Did you find him?”
“No,” he said, “but you have that look.”
Horror is what he saw. Thanks to a nearby jogger, JC was found a block away, gleefully chasing a cat that had wandered by during that blink of an eye when mine was turned elsewhere. Happy ending. Lesson learned.
I’ve never forgotten the officer’s haunting words and the agonies they suggested. Apparently, he had seen the expression enough times to recognize it. I’ve thought of them again recently as I’ve begun to notice “that look” we can now ascribe to the coronavirus pandemic.
As I take my morning walks, I can see the faces. The hellos are polite, but the brows are deeply furrowed. They tell the story of a nation in shock, the fear and grief over the loss of the world they knew and may never know again.
The pandemic has created a new etiquette to go with That Look. It’s a mixture of politesse and pragmatism. Two strangers will smile and duck their heads almost bashfully as they attempt to dodge each other, as if to say: I’m so sorry. I’m sure you’re a very nice person, but you might also be a human droplet of viral death, so, if you’ll pardon the expression, get the hell away from me. Sorry!
Then comes worse news. MIT professor Lydia Bourouiba has published an academic article suggesting that virus-infused droplets can travel as far as 27 feet. Her critics say that if such were the case, we’d all be sick by now, which is about as consoling as hearing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) say, “Testing, testing, testing.”
The silver lining? That’s easy: Families are staying home, cooking and eating meals together. Parents are home-schooling and probably not loving it but surely appreciating their kids’ teachers a bit more. We no longer debate quality vs. quantity time with so much of both going around. People also have more time to think, reflect, read, create and complete long-postponed home projects of importance — such as binge-watching “Ozark.”
But, the easy part is now over. The two-week shelter-in-place staycation — which many people needed anyway to catch up on sleep or pay their taxes — has run its course. The harder, longer, home-alone slog is just beginning and could last two months. Which raises the question: How long can previously free-ranging Americans remain sane under, essentially, house arrest?
Meanwhile, we’ve become subject to an incessant barrage of terrible news, as well as the daily press briefings conducted by President Trump, whose sudden flair for verbiage rivals that of the late Fidel Castro, who would speak for hours and hours while his subjects probably feigned rapt attention. One can’t help noticing, too, that many of Trump’s team members seem careful to preface their remarks with accolades for the president’s incredible leadership.
Those remarks are the opposite of reassuring, but you also get the idea the president relishes the salutes. Recall when Trump, having witnessed North Koreans “sit up at attention” to their supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, remarked that he’d like for his people to do the same to him? Well, hello, Pandemic. Trump has also recently said that Democratic governors “have to treat us well” if they want face masks and ventilators. One dares not cross the supreme leader, one reckons.
Trump’s transformation, from first calling the virus a hoax to trying to use it as leverage, only adds to the despair many are feeling. How can a country survive this test when its chief executive so lacks the virtues of leadership?
What’s clear from this reckoning and others to come is that, contra the we’re-all-in-this-together mantra, we’re all on our own. This means we need to wipe That Look off our faces and focus on staying well — inside our respective dwellings, comforted by the prospect that the curve will flatten and the virus will subside in time for the body politic to heal itself on Election Day. It really has become a matter of life and death."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-trump-and-california-may-face-off-over-fuel-rules/2020/03/31/bee003d0-739b-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,Why Trump and California Faced Off Over Auto Rules,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has completed a three-year quest to dismantle his predecessor’s most concrete environmental achievement: historic fuel-efficiency regulations for cars and light trucks. In 2011, under President Barack Obama, the auto industry agreed to meet stricter targets for fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions from 2017 to 2025. The Trump administration has now replaced those standards with far weaker requirements through 2026, months after it stripped California of its authority to set tailpipe CO2 limits of its own. Yet while the regulatory attack has been completed, the legal battles will continue for some time, with California leading the fight.
1. What standards are at issue?
The targets agreed to in 2011 call for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) of cars and trucks to rise from 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016 to a projected 51.4 by 2025 (down from an original projection of 54.5 mpg). Tailpipe CO2 emissions are to fall 31% to 173 grams per mile, a level similar to targets set in the European Union, China and Japan. Automakers are assigned corporate averages to meet, under a complex system that accounts for production volumes and the sizes of cars and trucks. If automakers fall short of corporate mpg targets, they face fines. If they miss CO2 standards, they could be barred from selling vehicles entirely.
2. Didn’t the new standards already take effect in 2016?
Technically they did. But a key concession by Obama was to agree to backload many of the increases. That means the manufacturers had to make only gradual improvements for the first decade but face steeply increasing requirements from 2021 to 2025. Automakers have endorsed the need for cleaner cars but say meeting ever-higher standards is proving a tricky task. GM’s redesigned Malibu sedan weighed 300 pounds less and had an engine 40% smaller but got just two more miles per gallon. At the same time, cheaper gas has tilted sales away from fuel-efficient cars. That’s increasing the burden of compliance on big pickups, which accounts for a significant portion of Ford Motor Co.’s profit in North America. In 2014, the company spent more than $1 billion to retool factories to build aluminum bodies for its F-150 pickup and introduced turbo-charged V-6 engines.
3. What do automakers want?
They say they’re spending more money than the government predicted to comply with the rules. They also want more credits granted for eco-friendly technology like aerodynamic design that can help them meet their targets. In negotiations that led to the rules, Obama agreed to an industry request for a midterm evaluation in 2017, in which regulators would examine whether the costs and benefits of the clean car rules were meeting expectations. In his last days in office, the Obama administration said it had completed the midterm evaluation and no changes were need -- to the chagrin of automakers.
4. How is California involved?
Under an agreement that dates to the creation of the EPA almost 50 years ago, the federal government has repeatedly affirmed that California, which struggles with smog, has a right to craft its own clean-air rules. The state is so big that carmakers try first to comply in California and then use the same designs everywhere else. During the Obama administration, the state agreed to let automakers that hit the new, tougher federal targets automatically comply with the state’s tailpipe carbon dioxide rules. In addition, more than a dozen other states, including New York and Massachusetts, have exercised their option under federal law to adopt clean-air rules that mirror California’s.
5. How much does this matter?
For California, a lot. The auto rules are key to achieving the state’s climate goals. In 2016, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law to cut California’s greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. To do that, some 40% of the state’s auto sales would have to be zero-emission vehicles -- ZEVs -- or gas-electric plug-ins by 2030, up from 3% now, according to staff projections from the state’s Air Resources Board.
6. What was Trump’s plan?
Former Environmental Protection Administration chief Scott Pruitt declared in April 2018 that the fuel-efficiency regulations for cars and light trucks were too stringent and must be revised. The following August, the EPA and Transportation Department’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration then proposed scrapping steady increases in mileage rules and instead recommended capping them at a roughly 37-mile-per-gallon fleet average after the 2020 model year. That proposal argued that easing mileage standards would reduce vehicle prices and make it easier for consumers to replace older, less-efficient cars with newer, safer vehicles, avoiding thousands of traffic fatalities in the process. It also proposed stripping California’s authority to regulate automobile greenhouse gas emissions, an unprecedented move challenging the state’s longstanding environmental power. It followed through on that piece of the plan in September 2019.
7. What did Trump do?
In March 2020, amid the global coronavirus pandemic, Trump’s agencies finalized replacement standards requiring 1.5% annual mileage improvements through 2026. Those figures were less aggressive than the original proposal but a major relaxation compared to the roughly 5% annual gains required under the Obama-era rules.
8. What was the reaction?
Conservative activists cheered the Trump administration’s effort while supporters of the previous rules were -- and still are -- outraged. Environmental advocates have argued the plan will result in cars that spew more carbon pollution. Consumer advocates say any up-front savings on new car prices will be eclipsed by higher fuel costs. Even some automakers have been cool to the approach and some have pushed back more forcefully. Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Honda and Volvo’s U.S. cars unit bucked the Trump administration and agreed to meet voluntary emissions targets set by California that are more stringent than the relaxed federal rules. California along with several other states and environmental organizations have sued the Trump administration to block its attack on the state’s authority."

Why doesn’t Trump?,"PRESIDENT TRUMP utters plenty of exaggerations, half-truths and flat-out lies, but sometimes what’s most stunning is when he tells the truth. Case in point: his mind-blowing admission that he wants fewer, not more, Americans to vote. As Congress last week considered reforms to encourage voting during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Trump was opposed. He explained this week that he doesn’t want to make it easier for Americans to vote because he believes that would hurt the Republican Party.
Mr. Trump is hardly the first Republican to embrace voter suppression for political reasons, but usually they’re at least a little embarrassed to acknowledge their motivation. That’s why they make up stories about voter fraud. And, of course, Mr. Trump is not just any Republican; it’s particularly depressing that the president of the United States would give voice to views that are so patently contrary to the spirit of democracy.
In an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Monday, Mr. Trump summarily dismissed a Democratic-led push for reforms — such as vote-by-mail, same-day registration and early voting — that were part of the negotiations over the recently enacted covid-19 pandemic relief package. “The things they had in there were crazy. They had things, levels of voting that if you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again,” he said.
Mr. Trump didn’t elaborate on his comment, but it was clear, as The Post’s Aaron Blake pointed out, that he linked high voter turnout to Republicans losing elections. In recent years, Republicans have vigorously erected barriers to voting, such as rigid voter identification and registration requirements, to discourage minorities, immigrants, young people and other groups seen as leaning Democratic from going to the polls. But seeking to take advantage of a deadly epidemic to depress turnout is a new low. It suggests that Mr. Trump thinks his best chance for a second term rests not with his handling of the pandemic crisis, but in Americans staying away from the polls because they fear for their health.

The $400 million included by Congress in the massive relief package to help states prepare for the November elections is, according to election officials from both parties and other election experts, not nearly enough to make the changes needed to give resiliency to the election system. Indeed, even if the country were not confronted with the uncertainties and challenges of a deadly pandemic, the proposed reforms have merit that argues for their enactment. Voters in states that have implemented mail-in voting, for example, express satisfaction with the ease and convenience and their ability to make more considered choices. Officials say it has helped voter turnout without encouraging fraud or threats to security.
There is still time before November for Congress and states to act. Mr. Trump’s embrace of voter suppression underscores the need for them to do so."

Chief among the older victims will be the retailers, who were struggling long before the novel coronavirus appeared in China and began its world tour. Macy’s, J.C. Penney, Kohl’s and the Gap, among others, all recently announced that they will be furloughing the majority of their workers without pay.
“We remain optimistic about JCPenney’s ability to weather this pandemic,” chief executive Jill Soltau said in a news release. If that’s actually true, she’s about the only one. Burdened by debt and struggling with declining foot traffic, many of the nation’s venerable retailers were already vulnerable to a killing blow. And the burgeoning recession is hitting much harder than even the Great Recession did. Revenue is not merely soft; in many cases, it has fallen toward zero.
A recent analysis by Miguel Faria-e-Castro, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis, projected that one-third of Americans could end up unemployed. Outside of groceries and a few basic essentials, even online sales — which made up only 11 percent of overall sales before covid-19 hit — have suffered since the quarantines began. This includes categories we might have expected to do well among a nation of shut-ins, such as DIY, home furnishings and sporting equipment, according to analytics firm Contentsquare.
Unless the world reopens for business almost immediately — and it’s difficult to see how that can happen safely — Americans may find that many of the stores they used to frequent remain shuttered, permanently, when the virus finally subsides. And that the list of dead storefronts could stretch well beyond retail to include many of their favorite bars and restaurants, their local movie theater, their gym, their co-working office.
Good government policy can mitigate some of the damage, for example, by giving businesses cheap loans to help pay their bills. But many businesses are too indebted to survive a long period with no revenue, while others will discover that a post-pandemic America no longer demands their services so much. The government shouldn’t save those businesses, and moreover, it won’t. Even if overall output recovers, that will leave a lot of fallow real estate and displaced workers.
Which is why, over the past few weeks, so many people have been arguing that strict social distancing imposes not merely a heavy economic burden but an intolerable one. I think those people are wrong, and not just because the unfolding crisis in New York is providing a painful lesson in the non-economic costs of doing too little, too late.
The United States is an immensely wealthy nation, one of the richest in history. We can afford to sacrifice a substantial chunk of our gross domestic product to save a substantial number of lives. What better do we have to spend our money on?
If what we are doing is unprecedented, it is only because earlier societies simply weren’t wealthy enough to manage it — as tragically, many developing countries still aren’t. The last time we saw such a plague was 1918, when average household income was about a third of what it is today, in inflation-adjusted dollars. We could shut down the entire economy for four months, produce not one good or service, and still be, collectively, twice as rich as our ancestors who lived through the 1918 flu pandemic.
Besides, we aren’t actually shutting down completely. We’re going to be providing quite a lot of health care, making a lot of masks and ventilators, crash-prioritizing a lot of scientific research. We’re also tossing out regulations that were crippling innovation in areas such as telemedicine. Some of that effort is simply the expense of virus fighting. But some of that effort will result in long-term gains, just as fighting World War II did.
But that’s paltry comfort to those who have sunk decades of their lives into building businesses that are threatened, or gaining skills and industry contacts that could suddenly become useless. So, while you’re cheering the health-care heroes running to the front lines, save some mental applause for the millions of people who are sitting inside right now and quietly, desperately, watching their expectations evaporate.
When this is over, they, too, will deserve our deepest gratitude — and all the help we can give them to get back on their feet."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-trump-and-california-faced-off-over-auto-rules/2020/03/31/bee003d0-739b-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,Why Trump and California Faced Off Over Auto Rules,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has completed a three-year quest to dismantle his predecessor’s most concrete environmental achievement: historic fuel-efficiency regulations for cars and light trucks. In 2011, under President Barack Obama, the auto industry agreed to meet stricter targets for fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions from 2017 to 2025. The Trump administration has now replaced those standards with far weaker requirements through 2026, months after it stripped California of its authority to set tailpipe CO2 limits of its own. Yet while the regulatory attack has been completed, the legal battles will continue for some time, with California leading the fight.
1. What standards are at issue?
The targets agreed to in 2011 call for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) of cars and trucks to rise from 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016 to a projected 51.4 by 2025 (down from an original projection of 54.5 mpg). Tailpipe CO2 emissions are to fall 31% to 173 grams per mile, a level similar to targets set in the European Union, China and Japan. Automakers are assigned corporate averages to meet, under a complex system that accounts for production volumes and the sizes of cars and trucks. If automakers fall short of corporate mpg targets, they face fines. If they miss CO2 standards, they could be barred from selling vehicles entirely.
2. Didn’t the new standards already take effect in 2016?
Technically they did. But a key concession by Obama was to agree to backload many of the increases. That means the manufacturers had to make only gradual improvements for the first decade but face steeply increasing requirements from 2021 to 2025. Automakers have endorsed the need for cleaner cars but say meeting ever-higher standards is proving a tricky task. GM’s redesigned Malibu sedan weighed 300 pounds less and had an engine 40% smaller but got just two more miles per gallon. At the same time, cheaper gas has tilted sales away from fuel-efficient cars. That’s increasing the burden of compliance on big pickups, which accounts for a significant portion of Ford Motor Co.’s profit in North America. In 2014, the company spent more than $1 billion to retool factories to build aluminum bodies for its F-150 pickup and introduced turbo-charged V-6 engines.
3. What do automakers want?
They say they’re spending more money than the government predicted to comply with the rules. They also want more credits granted for eco-friendly technology like aerodynamic design that can help them meet their targets. In negotiations that led to the rules, Obama agreed to an industry request for a midterm evaluation in 2017, in which regulators would examine whether the costs and benefits of the clean car rules were meeting expectations. In his last days in office, the Obama administration said it had completed the midterm evaluation and no changes were need -- to the chagrin of automakers.
4. How is California involved?
Under an agreement that dates to the creation of the EPA almost 50 years ago, the federal government has repeatedly affirmed that California, which struggles with smog, has a right to craft its own clean-air rules. The state is so big that carmakers try first to comply in California and then use the same designs everywhere else. During the Obama administration, the state agreed to let automakers that hit the new, tougher federal targets automatically comply with the state’s tailpipe carbon dioxide rules. In addition, more than a dozen other states, including New York and Massachusetts, have exercised their option under federal law to adopt clean-air rules that mirror California’s.
5. How much does this matter?
For California, a lot. The auto rules are key to achieving the state’s climate goals. In 2016, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law to cut California’s greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. To do that, some 40% of the state’s auto sales would have to be zero-emission vehicles -- ZEVs -- or gas-electric plug-ins by 2030, up from 3% now, according to staff projections from the state’s Air Resources Board.
6. What was Trump’s plan?
Former Environmental Protection Administration chief Scott Pruitt declared in April 2018 that the fuel-efficiency regulations for cars and light trucks were too stringent and must be revised. The following August, the EPA and Transportation Department’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration then proposed scrapping steady increases in mileage rules and instead recommended capping them at a roughly 37-mile-per-gallon fleet average after the 2020 model year. That proposal argued that easing mileage standards would reduce vehicle prices and make it easier for consumers to replace older, less-efficient cars with newer, safer vehicles, avoiding thousands of traffic fatalities in the process. It also proposed stripping California’s authority to regulate automobile greenhouse gas emissions, an unprecedented move challenging the state’s longstanding environmental power. It followed through on that piece of the plan in September 2019.
7. What did Trump do?
In March 2020, amid the global coronavirus pandemic, Trump’s agencies finalized replacement standards requiring 1.5% annual mileage improvements through 2026. Those figures were less aggressive than the original proposal but a major relaxation compared to the roughly 5% annual gains required under the Obama-era rules.
8. What was the reaction?
Conservative activists cheered the Trump administration’s effort while supporters of the previous rules were -- and still are -- outraged. Environmental advocates have argued the plan will result in cars that spew more carbon pollution. Consumer advocates say any up-front savings on new car prices will be eclipsed by higher fuel costs. Even some automakers have been cool to the approach and some have pushed back more forcefully. Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Honda and Volvo’s U.S. cars unit bucked the Trump administration and agreed to meet voluntary emissions targets set by California that are more stringent than the relaxed federal rules. California along with several other states and environmental organizations have sued the Trump administration to block its attack on the state’s authority."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/china-is-using-more-coal-again-this-time-it-may-be-a-good-thing/2020/03/31/50f5d946-730d-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,China Is Using More Coal Again. This Time It May Be a Good Thing,"China is burning more coal in yet another sign that the first country hit by a coronavirus outbreak is returning to a level of normalcy.
Daily coal burn at select coastal plants has doubled from early February, at the height of the country’s lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19. The plants are responding to resurgent electricity demand as factories restart in the world’s second-largest economy.
China’s use of coal is usually cause for consternation. The country mines and burns about half the world’s supply of the dirtiest fossil fuel, and it’s the primary reason China leads the world in carbon emissions. In fact, China’s shutdown to slow the spread of the virus probably kept about 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, at least temporarily.
Still, with Europe and the U.S. now in the grips of a similar lockdown and the global economy in tatters, signs that China is stirring back to life a little over two months since the outbreak are a beacon to the rest of the world.
“If the coal burn data can sustain above current levels and continues to rise, then it shows work resumption has normalized,” said Wang Miao, an analyst at Huatai Futures.
Coal use by the coastal power plants of five major Chinese utilities reached 488,800 tons last week, more than double from a low on Feb. 10, according to China Coal Transport & Distribution Association. The number was 471,000 tons on Tuesday.
The association typically publishes coal burn data from six big power groups. However, China Guodian Corp. hasn’t provided an update since late January. The remaining five are China Huaneng Group, China Datang Corp., Zhejiang Zheneng Electric Power Co., Guangdong Energy Group and Shanghai Electric Power Co.
More than 90% of markets, shops and malls in China and 70% of small- and medium-sized businesses have reopened as of mid-March, according to consultancy IHS Markit. China Railway has resumed work on about 93% of its major construction projects.
The consultancy said China’s power demand has already started to show year-on-year growth in March following an unprecedented slump in the first two months, according to a report Monday."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/which-bills-will-you-stop-paying-first/2020/03/31/f815a75a-739f-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,Which Bills Will You Stop Paying First?,"What’s more important: a roof over your head or a car in your driveway? With unemployment rising as the coronavirus shuts down parts of the U.S. economy, the decision made by borrowers as their payments come due will determine how securities backed by auto loans and leases perform.
Families will start to struggle as Covid-19 deepens its grip and job losses rise. Of the $14 trillion of consumer debt, mortgages account for $9 trillion and cars $1.3 trillion; however, more Americans have auto loans. When social distancing becomes the norm, cars seem more likely to fall down the priority list behind payments for homes, Netflix bills, phones and credit cards. With lockdowns spreading, many people aren’t going anywhere right now. 
That means the default risk is rising. Rating agencies are reassessing portfolios of loans and leases linked to asset-backed securities, or ABS, using loss levels from the 2008 financial crisis to calculate risk.
When these car-related debts start going bad, the impact on the bonds they back is severe. The spread of auto ABS over Treasuries widened sharply in recent weeks, more so than on card-backed debt. The current dislocations in credit markets show that while auto-loan defaults may not be the center of a financial crisis like mortgage-backed securities, they could well set off wider panic as consumer confidence crumbles, household balance sheets deteriorate and big issuers – car companies – struggle.
This market has grown rapidly since the last financial crisis. Already this year, almost $30 billion of auto asset-backed bonds have been issued in the U.S., following $118 billion in 2019. As of the third quarter last year, $250 billion was outstanding. At year-end, annualized loss rates on subprime auto ABS were around 9%, close to financial-crisis levels, while average interest rates have been even higher at 19%, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Two factors will determine how these bonds perform: unemployment and the value of used cars, because cash flows come directly from borrowers. In the aftermath of a natural disaster, used-car prices rise because property has been damaged or destroyed. In this crisis, they’re likely to fall due to strain on consumer wallets. That reduces the worth of the collateral and lowers the residual value of leases that back some of these securities. Cars are, after all, a depreciating asset.
What does this mean for the securitized bonds? Lenders and originators package pools of loans and leases in a special-purpose vehicle that then issues debt to investors. The interest and principal payments are structured into classes. Broadly, the more senior tiers have first claim on all cash flows and assets, while the junior take the first hit on losses but have higher yields. The lowest tranche, also known as the equity or first-loss pieces, is typically held by the issuer: auto companies’ financing arms and other lenders.  When loans default and the asset pool can’t make up for the payments due to investors, the holders of the lower tranches absorb the loss.
It will be yet another blow for the finance companies of already-struggling carmakers that issue ABS to finance leases and sales. They’ll take the first hit through the equity. Funding costs will surge and in turn squeeze sales, reminiscent of 2008.(3)As sales showed signs of reaching a plateau last year, auto giants, dealers and finance companies were pushing excessive financing with looser underwriting standards and conditions, such as longer terms and incentives. The weighted average credit score for non-prime loan pool borrowers was 590 last year, lower than 597 in 2008.
Household balance sheets were strong overall going into this crisis, but varied greatly across income levels. The bottom 20% of American households are far more leveraged — more than 25% — than the higher income brackets on a debt-to-assets basis. Around a third of auto ABS are typically made up of subprime loans, where the ability to pay drops off sharply and suddenly.
That doesn’t bode well. Companies like Ally Financial Inc. have already offered relief packages for consumers and dealers. Payments can be deferred for six months without late fees. New customers will be allowed to defer for three months. The Federal Reserve has brought back a financial crisis-era lending facility that’s meant to support the asset-backed securities market, where auto loans and leases are among the eligible collateral.
The troubles will go further: There are other auto sector-related ABS, like those backed by rental cars and dealer-floor financing plans that are even more directly dependent on automakers’ health.
Sure, structures have changed since 2008 to help lower the risk for investors on these bonds. But the underlying issues remain the same: consumers’ buying and borrowing behavior.
Investors are busy thinking about mortgage-backed securities, given their large size and potentially deeper and more immediate impact on the financial system. But it’s important to consider recent consumer trends: Delinquencies as a portion of outstanding loans have been on the way down for mortgages. They’re rising for autos, especially among subprime borrowers, as are past-due loans. 
America has always been a nation of drivers and the appeal of cars has a way of pushing consumers to stretch their budgets in a way houses don’t. But the stay-in-place strategies to fight this pandemic may change that calculus in a way investors aren’t prepared for: Driving behavior could change.
Unable to secure affordable financing, the financing arms severely curtailed lending and leasing activity. This caused vehicle sales volumes to plummet and hastened the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of Chrysler on April 30, 2009, and General Motors Inc. on June 1, 2009, according to S&P Global Ratings."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/04/01/biden-bernie-sanders-livestream-video-virtual-campaign/,The Washington Post,"Bernie and Biden have been courting voters virtually, and it’s not going well","Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are still campaigning for president — sporadically, virtually and badly.
Oh yes. They have been impressively awful.
But they must press on with their low-budget online backslapping and live-streamed speechifying if they want to connect with voters over the coming weeks and, perhaps, months. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee and Sanders, the long-shot candidate who will not stand down, must rely on long-distance campaigning to squeak out their message in a news cycle consumed with updates on the covid-19 outbreak and a terrifying economy.
They must get good at being authentic and engaging from their sofa, which is not as easy as all those Instagram influencers and YouTube stars make it seem. Live-streaming from your house is not the same thing as settling into a prime block on cable news where the professionals make sure your microphone is working, the lighting is flattering and you don’t look like you just wandered in from a crypt. And while the TV time constraints may be frustrating, they also have the benefit of forcing guests to stay out of the weeds and get to their point.
Live-streaming from home is more intimate, informal and revealing. It’s also more perilous.
Sanders and Biden are not the same kind of terrible. Each has his own unique hurdles to overcome. In the beginning, Biden struggled with the technology itself, his natural desire to emote and connect stymied by audio foul-ups and general confusion about who can hear him and who can’t. But he also seemed to want to get better by learning from his missteps. He has.
Some might recall his first attempt at a virtual town hall in mid-March. It was, as countless critics noted, a mess. Indeed, a subgenre of YouTube programming dedicated itself to parsing the many ways in which his Facebook-Live-meets-Zoom gathering went awry. The audio stalled. Questioners gave up and dropped out. Biden went all mush-mouthed as his eyes darted from the camera to the social-distancing human directing the glitch-fest.
Biden was suited up for the event and standing behind a makeshift lectern with a campaign placard attached to it — in what appeared to be his living room or den. For a candidate who prides himself on making intimate connections with voters, the presentation was one long conflicting message. Was this a formal presidential-ish address or a regular Joe sit-down?

Last week, however, Biden received a gift. CNN hosted him in a virtual town hall. Technically, it went off without a hitch. He was still at home, still wearing a suit, but the set had improved. There was no lectern. He had good posture. He was reasonably well-lit.
Allowed to speak for an extended period, without a debate buzzer going off after 30 seconds, Biden was focused and amiable. Anyone frustrated by politicians’ refusal to give a simple yes or no answer would have been heartened. When host Anderson Cooper asked Biden whether he’d support some of the recommendations made by Bill Gates in fighting this and future pandemics, Biden simply said, “Yes.”
He didn’t quite realize that the folks asking questions had submitted them earlier and weren’t hanging around on the line — as if they’d called into their local radio station. Long time listener. First time caller. I’ll take my answer off-air. But he made eye contact. He got personal talking about his grandchildren. Biden’s getting better. He’s learning how to make this newfangled form of campaigning work.
Perhaps Sanders knows just how unpleasant his live coronavirus roundtables are. He probably does. He just doesn’t care because Sanders has never been concerned with making hard medicine go down easier. He is here to bring you the facts. He’s broadcasting from home in Vermont. But he’s still yelling.
His roundtables are wholly on brand. His campaign regularly streamed his public appearances on Facebook and elsewhere. He prided himself on hijacking the media for his own purposes. But in this devastating moment, his brand has never been more glaringly lacking in warmth. He hosted a Friday evening roundtable in which he was slouched over a desk in a blood-red room with horror movie lighting from a glowing table lamp with its shade askew. He shuffled papers on his desk. He got into the footnotes of the $2 trillion federal stimulus bill. He looked down and around but rarely held eye contact with the viewer. He wore his at-home uniform: an open-collared shirt and blazer. He looked like neither a statesman nor a consoler.
Sanders introduced musicians and medical professionals like an irascible professor moderating a cable access show (which, indeed, Sanders once did). He was broadcasting facts but not actionable information, reassurance or enlightening news.
Sanders sat in front of a dark wooden chest of drawers lined with photographs. Were they personal pictures? Who could tell? Does the average voter know what anyone in his family looks like aside from his wife, Jane? Instead of adding an air of familiarity, the photos came across as mere decorative objects.
He tangled with a few audio glitches. One of his guests, Zenei Cortez, president of National Nurses United, which supports Medicare-for-all, was so dramatically backlit that she looked as though she was dialing in from a witness protection program. Sanders peppered his comments with “furthermore,” which is a word that shouldn’t be used in formal writing let alone casual conversation.
Another roundtable on Monday was more like a conference call when multiple panelists appeared solely via audio.
This new form of campaigning is hard. But it’s even more challenging and frustrating for voters. They can’t buttonhole a politician at an event and demand answers to their specific concerns; they can’t protest at a rally. They can’t look these men — ah, yes, only men — in the eye and see how they bear up.
But if the candidates fully embrace live-streamed conversations, they can potentially reveal the best of themselves. In a room without moderators or time keepers, without commercial interruptions, what can they communicate at a time when there’s an urgent need for leaders who speak in a way that is informed, decisive, honest and empathetic?
The candidates are at home. Every virtual event is an invitation to stop in and stay for a bit. Make folks glad they came."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/us-military-puts-korean-workers-on-unpaid-leave-as-talks-over-costs-continue/2020/04/01/30186308-73c9-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,U.S. military puts Korean workers on unpaid leave as talks over costs continue,"TOKYO — The commander of U.S. troops in South Korea said he was heartbroken on Wednesday after taking the unprecedented step of putting about 4,000 local workers on unpaid leave — in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic — as the allies struggle to reach agreement on sharing defense costs.
The impasse stems from President Trump’s demand that Seoul raise more than fivefold its contribution to the cost of stationing about 28,500 U.S. troops in the country, a demand that South Korea says is politically impossible to meet.
Negotiators have since narrowed the gap between the two sides, and South Korea believes a deal may be close. But with money running out, the U.S. military command in South Korea placed nearly half the South Korean workers at its military bases on unpaid leave on Wednesday, for the first time in the history of the 70-year alliance.
“This is an unfortunate day for us. It’s unthinkable. It’s heartbreaking,” Gen. Robert B. Abrams, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, told the furloughed workers. The partial furlough “is not what we envisioned or hoped would happen,” he said, according to a transcript of his remarks.
A union representing the South Korean workers said that about 4,000 of the U.S. bases’ 8,500 local employees were furloughed.
On Tuesday, South Korean negotiator Jeong Eun-bo said the decision to furlough the workers “does not properly reflect the situation of the negotiations” and called it regrettable.
Jeong said that negotiations for a new deal were in their “final phase” and that he expected an agreement to be concluded soon.
“There seems to have been some progress, but the negotiations are still underway,” an official with South Korea’s presidential Blue House told reporters late Wednesday.
Abrams said the furlough was necessary because “programmed funds” had run out in the absence of a cost-sharing agreement.
Under the previous deal, South Korea paid about $870 million toward the cost of the U.S. troop presence, but Trump has said he wants a contribution of about $5 billion.
Abrams urged the governments in Seoul and Washington to reach a deal soon.
“These are our employees, our co-workers, our teammates, and we consider them family,” he said. “It is an understatement to say these are challenging times, as no one feels the impact more than our furloughed employees.”
Jonathan Pollack, a senior nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution, pointed out the irony of the White House requesting assistance from South Korea to combat the novel coronavirus even as the Pentagon continues to push for more money from the country.
“It’s both a colossal mess and potentially a very dangerous one,” he said.
South Korea’s left-leaning Hankyoreh newspaper called the threat to the livelihoods of South Korean workers “a shame and a disgrace.”"

Banks in Japan tapped the Fed for more than $180 billion last month alone to become one of the biggest users of the central bank program aimed at boosting global liquidity. With the purchases, the banks are acting as intermediaries by releasing cash into the economy as businesses build up dollar reserves, said Kanetsugu Mike, chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association.
Even amid the market turmoil caused by the pandemic, Japanese banks aren’t experiencing dollar funding difficulties as they did during the height of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, Mike, 63, said in an interview. The Bank of Japan has encouraged banks to borrow as much as they wanted through the Fed’s expanded swap lines to ease a dollar shortage, people with knowledge of the matter said.
“As a whole, we are not in a situation that could cause concern for the financial system,” said Mike, who is also president of MUFG Bank, after stepping down Tuesday as chief executive officer of MUFG parent Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest bank.
Dollar funding has long been an issue for Japanese banks as they aggressively expand overseas. While the lenders have plenty of yen-denominated deposits from customers, they rely on market funding including bond issuance to procure dollars and other foreign currencies, which often jump in price during market stress.

“Companies are bracing themselves for unexpected events in a move that has added to demand for dollars, and banks are likely working to get hold of enough funds,” said Hideyasu Ban, an analyst at Jefferies in Tokyo, commenting on the Fed purchases.
Another reason for Japan’s unprecedented take-up of the Fed program is the low cost of the funds. The facility has allowed banks to borrow dollars for three months at 0.35%, compared with 2% if they do so against the yen in foreign-exchange markets.
In all, Japan’s banks have taken down $185 billion, more than the entire euro area.
That’s beginning to ease stress in market-sourced dollar funding. The premium for floating dollars over yen -- as seen in the three-month yen-dollar cross-currency basis -- hit its narrowest in a month on Tuesday.
Mike said banks’ dollar funding has become more robust since the global financial crisis that saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. “In terms of dollar liquidity for Japanese banks, the situation is not the same as the time of Lehman,” he said.
The Japanese Bankers Association represents more than 100 banks in the country, and its chairmanship rotates annually among Japan’s top three lenders.
Recessionary Hit
Japan’s economy has probably slipped into recession, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. calling for a contraction of as much as 3.1% this year. Amid the slowdown, MUFG has seen strong demand for loans, especially via online applications, Mike said.
The number of online loan requests by small and medium-sized businesses tripled in March compared with November, before the pandemic struck, he said. Growth in unsecured loans made to individuals online and by phone also tripled last month from a year earlier, he added.
Mike said it’s too early to forecast the impact of the pandemic on loan portfolios.
“It’s not that companies have lost their fundamental competitiveness or are making bad investments,” he said. “I expect businesses will be back on track once corporate activity resumes.”"

The central bank is expected to announce a new emergency facility to support municipal debt, part of the $2 trillion stimulus approved last week. It had the backing of progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans alike, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Mike Crapo. They’re urging the Fed and Treasury to move quickly.
The coronavirus pandemic has crimped sources of tax revenue for states and localities at a time when resources, including paramedics and hospitals, are being committed to combat the threat to public health.
In the next round of legislation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some congressional Democrats want to push further. They favor taking decisions about where to use the money out of the political realm and giving them solely to the independent Fed.
The notion has been circulating for months among progressives in Congress. If the law is changed, it would give the Fed another congressionally mandated goal -- beyond stable prices and maximum employment -- by designating the Federal Open Market Committee to be the buyer of last resort of the debt of troubled states and municipalities.
“If you want money to go somewhere quickly, everybody’s idea right now is to get the Fed involved,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington. “That doesn’t take into account that the Fed has to build these facilities and structures to do something they’ve never done before.”
Permanent Change
Legislation introduced by Democratic Senator Robert Menendez would create a permanent change to the Federal Reserve Act to allow the central bank to purchase municipal debt “under unusual and exigent circumstances” through direct purchases via open market operations.
Currently, the Fed and Treasury are operating under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act. It allows the Fed, with Treasury permission, to open a broad-based facility to support troubled areas of the financial markets in an emergency.
Municipal bonds have rallied in anticipation of the intervention. Last week was the best for state and local debt since 1982, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. A handful of debt issuers have been able to price deals in the last few days after billions in transactions were scuttled earlier this month, a signal that the market is starting to regain its footing.
Eric Kim, head of state-government ratings at Fitch Ratings Inc., said the $150 billion set aside in the stimulus bill for state and local governments is limited to reimbursement and may not be spent.
Pandemic Hotspots
“Outside of pandemic hotspots like New York, new spending is not the problem for most states, but rather lost revenue brought on by severely reduced economic activity,” he said March 27.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently expanded the central bank’s lending authority to include support for corporations and medium-sized businesses. Democrats have had a long-standing interest, however, in the Fed using its power to operate in open markets to do something directly for troubled localities.
Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, had a sharp exchange with Powell in February over his authority to support municipal debt.
Fed’s Job
“Do you not believe that the governments of Detroit and Puerto Rico also play a vital role that should be preserved, even if a financial crisis makes it hard for them to borrow money?” Tlaib asked Powell.
“That’s not a job for the Fed,” Powell said. “Lending to state and local governments and supporting them when they’re in bankruptcy is not -- that’s not part of our mandate.”
Tlaib finished by saying: “We are going to strongly disagree.”
Pelosi has also taken an interest in Powell’s ability to directly support states and localities.
“I hope that in this next bill that we will be able to address the concerns of our state and local governments,” Pelosi told MSNBC on Tuesday. “We need to do more by way of our appropriations, by way of our tax code and by way of policy and also by way of the Fed.”"
"April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/01/bidens-latest-message-is-preview-what-is-come/,The Washington Post,Joe Biden’s latest message is a preview of what is to come,"Former vice president Joe Biden has been forced to do what no presidential candidate has ever done: Shift from a live campaign to a virtual one in the middle of an election. Most of the components of a traditional campaign — from public rallies to primary-night election parties to policy speeches before policy groups to appearances at conventions of key supporters (e.g., unions) to door knocking to setting up campaign offices in key states — have for the foreseeable future vanished. Even the primary schedule has been blown up. And, perhaps worst of all, for a presidential campaign, asking for money seems dicey as people are seeing the economy sink, their businesses shuttered and their jobs vanish.
Campaigning in a virtual mode forces a team to translate the modern elements of a campaign into new forms. The Biden team is going to have to learn as it goes, substituting virtual news conferences, virtual fundraisers, virtual roundtables and virtual volunteer events for physical, in-person affairs.
The good news for the Biden team is that millions upon millions of people are at home — and for once may be eager to pick up the phone even for a number on caller-ID that they do not recognize. They have time to watch Biden’s events on the computer and time to watch his appearances on Sunday shows.
Biden’s latest digital ad gives us a peek at what he will try to convey during an unprecedented time in a unique campaign environment:
Biden seems ready to focus on four aspects of the covid-19 crisis.
First, Biden will not spare President Trump from the charge that he failed as commander in chief, sending troops (health-care workers) into the fray without sufficient protection and equipment. The more Trump protests that governors do not need ventilators or that there are plenty of tests, the more fodder he provides to Biden that Trump is a derelict, incompetent commander in chief.
Second, Biden now can put meat on the bones of his message that the election is a fight for the “soul of the nation.” Originally, this meant a battle to recapture America as a decent, fair and welcoming country. Now, in the covid-19 pandemic, the battle is between two ways of addressing adversity. In Biden’s telling, Republicans focus on bailing out corporate interests (e.g., the giant slush fund) and savaging regulations (even clear-air requirements in the middle of a respiratory illness) while Democrats want to focus on more help for nurses and responders, more unemployment pay and more help for small business. (The Senate majority leader is already dragging his feet on a fourth stimulus package). How the two sides react to the pandemic becomes emblematic of their values and priorities.
Third, the Democrats’ best argument in 2018 was health care. Now that we are in a health-care epidemic not seen for 100 years, Democrats have an obvious upper hand. Unbelievably, Republicans will not drop their lawsuit seeking to invalidate all of Obamacare. In addition, on Tuesday, Politico reported, “The Trump administration has decided against reopening Obamacare enrollment to uninsured Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, defying calls from health insurers and Democrats to create a special sign-up window amid the health crisis.” This is horrifyingly cruel and politically shortsighted. Republicans however seem determined to be on the side of taking away or denying health-care coverage to millions of Americans. This is a gift to the Biden team.
Finally, Biden plainly wants this to be about a contrast in leadership styles. In place of Trump’s bombast, irrationality and vindictiveness, Biden presents a calm and empathetic figure. Who do Americans want to listen to for the next four years, and who do they trust to guide them through the recovery from America’s worst domestic disaster in a century? On that, Biden is betting the contest won’t be close."

Matthews and his wife were already busy raising their young son when they decided to take in a baby niece whose own parents weren't able to care for her.
“He just brought her on in, no fuss,” Alice Matthews recalled Wednesday, a day after her husband died of covid-19 at a suburban Richmond hospital. “He just was that kind of a man. He saw a need.”
Sterling Matthews, 60, who lived south of Richmond in Chester, Va., died Tuesday at Bon Secours St. Francis Medical Center.
He first went to the hospital on March 23 seeking to be tested for the novel coronavirus, but he was told he had pneumonia and was sent home, Alice Matthews said. His health continued to deteriorate, and on Friday, he went back to St. Francis by ambulance. He was admitted and tested positive for the virus.
Alice Matthews and other family members were not allowed to visit him in the hospital. She talked to him twice before he died.
“I haven’t seen him since Friday,” she said. “They would just call me and give me updates. They really are not letting anyone in, no matter what.”
Now she is grieving in physical isolation, given her likely exposure to the virus.
“I wanted to go down there and see her, but if I did that, then my 15 days [of isolation] start,” said their son, Jammal Matthews, 38, who lives in Prince William County. “My mom’s tough, she’s very tough. But, obviously, this hurts. . . . I’m checking on her, making sure she’s eating. I call her every three hours. I know she hates being in the house.”
Sterling Matthews, who would have turned 61 on April 13, grew up in Richmond, the son of a Philip Morris factory worker and a hairdresser, both of whom survive him. He met his future wife at Armstrong High School, then located in the city’s Church Hill neighborhood.
“I liked everything about him,” Alice Matthews said. “He was just kind and not one of these guys that you think you can date, and you can try and go figure out, is he playing you? If you was his girl, you was his girl. He didn’t stray away from that. He treated me like a queen.”
They would have celebrated their 40th anniversary in June.
A veteran of both the U.S. Air Force and Army, Sterling Matthews was working in support services at Fort Belvoir, an Army installation in Fairfax County, when he became ill. He was relatively healthy, after beating prostate cancer a few years ago, his son said. His wife fiercely monitored his blood sugar to control his diabetes.
“She was a tiger lady on that,” Jammal Matthews said. “He never had a complication from his diabetic status.”
Sterling Matthews and his wife, an administrative assistant for the Virginia Department of Education, had been looking forward to retiring in two years. Their plan, Alice said, was to “be with our grandbabies.”
Jammal and his wife have a daughter, Devyn, 3. Michell Lyons, the cousin his parents raised as their daughter, has two children, Aaliyah, 12, and Caleb, 7.
Matthews was a deacon at Moore Street Missionary Baptist Church, assistant superintendent of its Sunday school program and a Sunday school teacher. He also mentored at-risk boys through the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, which included taking the boys to etiquette classes to prepare them for the fraternity’s annual scholarship ball.
“They would teach them where to put the napkins, which fork to use, which glass to use, stuff like that,” his wife said. “He thought it was important for . . . the young boys to become men.”
Jammal Matthews said his father always gave “100 percent” to anyone who needed his help.
“He took an interest in people, and he always used to say, ‘You just can’t throw people away,’ ” the son said. “He always thought there was something redeeming about the human spirit and that encouragement in a positive way would bring out the best in people.”"
"April 2, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/01/what-trump-can-learn-real-wartime-presidents/,The Washington Post,What Trump can learn from real wartime presidents,"Against the challenge of the novel coronavirus, President Trump has said that he thinks of himself as a “wartime president.”
This is hardly the first time a president has used this metaphor, inexact as it may be. Richard Nixon asked Congress in 1971 to declare “war on cancer.” Lyndon Johnson in 1964 declared that his administration “here and now declares unconditional war on poverty in America."" Poignantly, neither of those efforts came close to succeeding, but the strong language signaled a president aiming to mobilize the full resources of American society to conquer the problem.
One of the hallmarks of our system is that leadership in crisis must not only come from a president but also all reaches of society — in recent weeks, we have seen sparks of initiative from Congress, governors, the heroes of the emergency room and the research lab. We should all remember that from wartime presidential leadership we can learn as much from the mistakes as the accomplishments.
The history of U.S. wartime presidents offers seven lessons not only for Trump but also for leaders of all kinds:
Level with the public. James K. Polk in 1846 fabricated a reason to wage war against Mexico and lied to Congress and Americans about his intention to use that conflict to acquire almost 1 million square miles of new territory. When the 1918 flu broke out among U.S. soldiers, Woodrow Wilson disgracefully concealed the danger, kept sending troops to Europe and never gave a single speech about the pandemic that claimed 675,000 American lives and tens of millions abroad. At the start of major U.S. involvement in Vietnam in 1965, Johnson concealed from the public his dread that the war might grind on for a decade, take many lives and never be won.
Work to unite the country against the common enemy. War should not be a time for partisanship, yet James Madison waged the War of 1812 on the flimsy basis of a narrow congressional majority. Harry Truman never bothered to ask Congress for a war declaration against Korea. By contrast, after Pearl Harbor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had just won a third term from an electorate bitterly split over whether to fight Hitler or stay out, managed to make the World War II fight for freedom into the cause of almost every American.
Show empathy for the warriors, the scared and the suffering. Madison and Abraham Lincoln braved gunfire to visit scenes of battle. After the Spanish-American War, William McKinley went to Long Island to visit the tents of quarantined soldiers who had caught yellow fever while fighting in Cuba. Told that the mounting casualties of the Civil War required a new cemetery, Lincoln demanded that it be located near his summer cottage. He wished to make sure that he saw the burials and grieving families, so that the horrible, hourly decisions he was making about life and death would never become too abstract.
Build confidence in your plan for victory. Today FDR is remembered as perhaps the most successful war president of all time. But in early 1942, many Americans thought of him as the commander in chief who had made serious mistakes that culminated in the Japanese surprise attack. Thus, he spoke often in public and went on radio to explain the Allied blueprint to win the war. Before he spoke, the White House would ask Americans to buy world maps and globes so that they could follow along.
After the Soviets sneaked missiles into Cuba, John F. Kennedy knew he was facing not only a world crisis but also big domestic political trouble. He had assured Americans that there would be no such missiles in Cuba and made errors that had encouraged Nikita Khrushchev to put them there. But his TV speech revealing the presence of the missiles and his blockade plan to get them out was so shrewd and effective that to this day he is remembered not for his mistakes but for his mastery.
Warn of impending bad news as soon as you know about it. In 1942, two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR told Americans, “The news is going to get worse and worse before it gets better and better, and the American people deserve to have it straight from the shoulder.” Kennedy cautioned his TV audience that the Cuban missile crisis could last for months.
Trust wise, experienced experts. Lincoln fired Gen. George McClellan and finally promoted Ulysses Grant, to whom he gave considerable decision-making authority. Roosevelt prided himself on what he had learned about war as Wilson’s assistant secretary of the Navy, but he let Gen. Dwight Eisenhower run the D-Day invasion.
Stay focused and avoid mission creep. Madison let the 1812 war grow from a campaign to stop British harassment of U.S. ships into an effort to seize Canada. Polk’s Mexican War, ostensibly in response to a border skirmish, stretched almost 800 miles to Mexico City. LBJ inflated his effort to defend South Vietnam into a crossroads of the Cold War that threatened direct conflict with Russia and China.
A military confrontation is not the same thing as fighting a pandemic. No crisis in history ever provides an exact precedent for a challenge that a president is dealing with in real time.
But as Truman said, those in positions of authority must always be students of history. “Every leader,"" as he put it, ""must be a reader.”"
"April 2, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/britain-is-going-on-a-massive-debt-spree/2020/04/01/5c9777ca-7400-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html,The Washington Post,Britain Is Going on a Massive Debt Spree,"The U.K. Debt Management Office (DMO) has put out a signal of intent: More government bond supply is about to come thick and fast. The amount of gilts to be sold in April will be raised from 20 billion pounds ($22 billion) to 45 billion pounds.
Boris Johnson’s government needs swift access to more funding to support the economy during the coronavirus shutdown. The good news is the bond market can handle it with ease, even in a market environment like this one. It helps enormously that the U.K. Treasury and the Bank of England are working in lockstep to deal with the financial side of the Covid-19 crisis. 
It makes sense to front-load the surge in Gilt issuance, as the BOE is already ramping up its Quantitative Easing bond-buying program by 200 billion pounds in an accelerated schedule. The net effect on investor demand should therefore be fairly muted, as the central bank will be in the market, hoovering up debt.
Thankfully the DMO, which operates as the Treasury’s agent in the debt market, has vast experience in this area from the financial crisis a decade ago. Even after more than doubling the size of April’s gilts sale, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was little changed at 31 basis points, not far from its record low yield of seven basis points seen on March 9.
Britain’s coordinated response to the economic mayhem has been genuinely impressive, and groundbreaking. The DMO and the central bank are working together to smooth out what — according to analysts from Royal Bank of Canada — could be a doubling of overall debt sales across the whole of the upcoming financial year (April to April) to about 300 billion pounds. There will be 17 gilt auctions in April alone. This is a full-blown emergency response. 
It’s especially important to tread carefully with this almost unprecedented surge in supply with the most sensitive and illiquid longer maturity gilts. The DMO is limiting issuance of the longest-dated stuff to 12 billion pounds in April, which will be outweighed by planned BOE purchases of 21 billion pounds. The central bank has raised its total purchases of assets to nearly 5 billion pounds on three days per week and will probably buy more than 60 billions pound in April alone, easily exceeding new supply.
The two entities are having to be careful not to get in each other’s (or investors’) way by making sure the BOE doesn’t snap up too many of the most in-demand bonds, and equally not to overload any sector.
The BOE only buys from investment bank primary dealers in the secondary market rather than directly from the Treasury but the rules might be relaxed with so many auctions taking place, to avoid straining the primary dealers’ balance sheets. This could necessitate direct monetary financing , as former BOE deputy governor Charlie Bean said this week, meaning the BOE actually buys straight from the Treasury. With so many traders working from home, the risk of an operational glitch causing a failed auction is disproportionately high. The authorities need an insurance policy.
Both debt issuance and QE buybacks will probably tail off later in the year and both can be altered together if the economic situation improves — or worsens. This is a make it up as you go along moment, but as long as the communication to the market remains as clear as it has been, any amendments shouldn’t cause problems. It helps that the average maturity of U.K. debt is significantly longer than all other major bond markets at 15 years, meaning there’s less urgency in refinancing debt. But having such joined-up institutions in the country’s hour of need is very fortunate.

But that doesn’t guarantee Spring sunshine and flowers as winter ends. Eminent investors such as Oaktree Capital Group LLC co-founder Howard Marks and DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach are warning that the worst may not be over. April really could be the cruelest month for equities as a brief bear market rally peters out and the lows are tested again. Until there’s evidence that the worst of the virus contamination is under control, the economy and financial markets are at its mercy.
Fixed-income assets have a tendency to show where equities are headed during crises and yet again U.S. Treasury bond yields are pushing lower, a clear warning of a renewed flight to quality.
While central banks have swiftly enacted the playbook learnt from the financial crisis more than a decade ago, and even parsimonious governments such as Germany’s are reaching for the fiscal checkbook, the emergency aid is only reaching higher-quality assets.
Sub-investment grade companies and non-agency mortgage debt are trapped in a downward spiral. Marks pointed to mounting job losses and business defaults and said the range of negative outcomes is wider now. Gundlach said the current economy resembles a depression and that he expects many defaults, although he advocates a hardline approach with “no government bailouts whatsoever.” That might not meet with popular approval.
The critical faultline in the coronavirus-induced selloff has been the sudden strength in the dollar, as banks and investors globally liquidate assets and scramble for cash — above all, dollar cash. Until the Federal Reserve can satisfy onshore and offshore demand for the greenback, the economic effects of that will spread like wildfire. Everybody is desperate for liquidity, from the commercial property market to blue-chip Exxon Mobil Corp., which had to come to the bond market recently as it couldn’t get the size of funding it wanted in commercial paper. 
With this lack of access to liquidity rising all over corporate America — especially in junk-rated companies —  assets everywhere are being used as ATMs to raise urgent funds.
Some of the Fed’s liquidity measures won’t become fully operational until April 6, such as the crucial commercial paper funding facility, where the central bank will buy directly from eligible U.S. issuers. Until that backstop measure to ease borrowing in the corporate market kicks in, there will be little respite.
We have also just passed the end of the Japanese financial year, and there has been super-strong demand from the country’s banks for dollar liquidity. It’s been running at a rate of nearly 10 times that of European banks, which is bound to have an impact.
Until the volatility in the dollar money markets subsides there will no be peace for other asset classes and the intense pressure for liquidation will persist. The Fed is alive to the problem and has extended its dollar swaps lines to all foreign central banks (if they have an account with the New York Fed), allowing them to park U.S. Treasury bonds in return for cash.
The dollar is the world’s reserve currency and the Fed is now acting as the central bank to all. Only by pumping out liquidity globally can it possibly prevent an even more almighty rush into dollars. Until it has put a lid on the money-market stress, the rest of the financial markets remain in peril."

With unprecedented amounts of economic stimulus planned to combat an unparalleled situation, it’s essential that the authorities spare at least some attention to what a post-pandemic exit strategy might look like. 
Once the virus is subdued and the lockdowns end, governments should convert a chunk of the aid they’ve distributed into equity stakes in the recipients, with the ensuing portfolio of holdings assembled into sovereign wealth funds.
Norway currently has the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, overseeing about $945 billion and funded by the nation’s oil revenue. Singapore has had a wealth fund for more than four decades. Egypt, Senegal and Turkey have all set up wealth funds in recent years to manage their state-owned companies, with South Africa saying earlier this year that it plans a similar move.
Countries in Europe have toyed with the idea in the past. In August, a draft proposal for a “European Future Fund” suggested an initial 100 billion-euro ($110 billion) pot could be set aside to invest in strategic industries in the European Union. But as my colleague Ferdinando Giugliano argued at the time, the EU is not a sovereign state, and such a fund would just divert existing budget resources rather than tapping a pool of wealth.
In the U.K., the May 2017 Conservative Party manifesto proposed what it called Future Britain funds, which would “hold in trust the investments of the British people, backing British infrastructure and the British economy.” The pitch said the money would come from “shale gas extraction, dormant assets and the receipts of sale of some public assets.” Almost three years later, there’s still no sign of those plans being enacted. (That’s probably just as well given their paltry financial underpinning; as myself and my colleague Marcus Ashworth wrote at the time, those sources would have provided a minuscule capital base, even before fracking was banned in Britain.)
But the current crisis provides an opportunity for individual countries to make good on those vague promises by setting up wealth funds that are big enough to count as full-blown assets to society, given the scale of financial assistance that’s likely to be required to get through these dark days.
They could start by assigning existing state investments to wealth funds. The U.K. government, for example, still owns about 60% of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, more than a decade after bailing out the ailing lender to the tune of more than 45 billion pounds ($56 billion) as part of a wider rescue of the domestic banking industry. The German government has a stake of almost 16% in Commerzbank AG, while Belgium and France have control of Dexia SA, split 53% to 47%.
The global financial crisis made many banks wards of their states. Formalizing those stakes in wealth funds would be a way to start building state-owned asset portfolios. During normal times, governments could be sleeping equity partners. But in times of crisis — like now — governments would have a more direct pathway to influence lenders to help borrowers weather any economic storm. 
For the U.K., creating a wealth fund would solve the issue of preserving vital domestic infrastructure without handing free money to foreign conglomerates. The owners of Heathrow Airport, for example, include Qatar Holding, the government of Singapore’s GIC Pte Ltd., and the China Investment Corp. By making aid conditional on receipt of equity, Britain would be getting a stake at current distressed values in return for bailout funds.
Today’s situation demands aid packages for a swathe of industries feeling the pain, including automakers and travel companies. If having such a broad range of stakes feels too interventionist, wealth-fund holdings could be restricted to infrastructure that’s vital to the economic functioning of a country. Though that could prove to be a tough distinction; given initial lockdown experiences, an argument could be made that suppliers of internet broadband and food delivery should qualify.
For those who still insist the state should stay out of private enterprises, note that governments are already effectively telling companies how to run their affairs in return for aid. Earlier this week, Germany asked companies seeking help to suspend their dividends, with France also asking the same from firms that defer tax liabilities. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier also wants senior executives to “contribute in emergencies, especially with respect to bonus payments,” according to an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung at the weekend.
One of the new realities of the post-virus economy will be increased state involvement in business. Companies are likely to come under pressure to shorten their supply chains and bring more manufacturing back home, wherever home may be. The lines of production will become shorter, as regional ties replace at least some of the worldwide outsourcing that has been a keystone of the globalized economy. That will be easier to enforce if governments’ holdings give them seats on corporate boards.
Shareholdings would give governments additional clout to influence better corporate behavior as more nations embrace their responsibilities to the future of the planet. Until now, asset managers have long been leading the drive to force firms to give greater emphasis to environmental, social and governance issues.
A decade ago, a key complaint about the rescue of the global financial system was that public money was used to compensate for private risk taking gone awry. While this crisis is undoubtedly different, there’s still a danger that as governments pledge billions of dollars, euros and pounds to businesses, public support will wane as the scale of the financial challenge becomes apparent. Building equity stakes that belong to the nation will help offset voter mistrust about the wisdom of such largess, allowing everyone to participate in the economic recovery that the disbursements are designed to facilitate.
As the saying goes, never let a serious crisis go to waste."
"April 2, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/,The Washington Post,Everyone wore masks during the 1918 flu pandemic. They were useless.,"People called them “flu fences” and “chin sails.” Gala attendees fastened theirs with gaudy earrings. Smokers cut flaps in them, and movie houses gave them away with tickets.
During the influenza pandemic of 1918, officials often advised Americans to wear face masks in public. Doctors believed that masks could help prevent “spray infections,” according to historian John M. Barry in his book, “The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History.” Enforced by local health officials, the facial coverings grew routine. Often, Red Cross chapters fashioned and distributed the masks that were “seen everywhere and would become a symbol of the epidemic,” Barry wrote. Americans used the masks as a method of retaining some normalcy during a pandemic that killed at least 675,000 Americans and 50 million people worldwide. It was the only aspect of the catastrophe discussed with any humor.
If directed to wear a mask, homemade worked. “Take a piece of gauze the size of a sheet of typewriter paper,” said instructions in the Atlanta Constitution. “Fold it twice, so that it will fit an envelope. Then attach strings to the four corners and tie these strings at the back of the neck. The mask covers the nose and mouth, so that the wearer breathes through four thicknesses of gauze. A clean handkerchief is just as good as the gauze.”
Now, amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is debating whether it should recommend that people wear masks when they go outside. In 1918, with a different virus, it didn’t help.
Iowa’s State Board of Health reminded those sewing masks to add some “colored worsted [a type of yarn] or tape” on the part of the mask that would be the outside. The upper margin was to be drawn tightly over the bridge of the nose, right under the eyes. Masks were to be washed after each use, not touched once they were tied on, and boiled for five minutes before wearing again.
The masks disrupted lives in unexpected ways. A San Francisco fisherman said “bandits” in flu masks robbed him. A woman taking a train from Chicago to Pasadena, Calif., reportedly experienced a break from sanity when she disembarked and “beheld the masked city,” according to a story in the Los Angeles Times. And columnist Fay King bemoaned the new mustaches. Men who formerly “couldn’t bear to have [a] hairy lip classed with a tooth brush” were growing facial hair, now hidden behind the masks.
On Nov. 1, 1918, Eugene C. Caley became the first man in Oakland, Calif., to be arrested for not wearing a mask. He was released on bail, although similar scofflaws in San Francisco had been sentenced to up to 10 days in jail. (Departments donated revenue from fines to the Red Cross.)
“This is only the beginning,” said the chief of police, according to the Oakland Tribune. “We are going to enforce this mask ordinance if we have to pack the city jail with people. This epidemic is too serious to be taken as a joke, and men arrested … will find that it’s no laughing matter when they face the police judges.”
Some complained that the masks were “unsanitary,” and bureaucratic confusion could stymie whether they were worn. In Alexandria, La., a sanitation leader for the Army ordered flu masks be worn. But waiters removed theirs because their local public health official said that the masks prevented “free breathing,” according to the Town Talk.
Tobacco-chewing workers were “kept busy putting the masks on and off” to spit, reported the Fort Wayne Sentinel, while smokers became creative. One cigar vendor made doors in masks so that her wares could be enjoyed, reported the Oakland Tribune. One man fashioned a cigarette holder from a long rubber tube, and another simply shoved his mask up over his forehead.
“I am 75 years old and have been living in this state 67 years,” a man named E. Piercy told a police court, according to Los Angeles’ Evening Express. “I must have my smoke, and I’m not going to give up my tobacco for a cheesecloth muzzle!”
Touting their ability to distract an anxiety-ridden public, movie houses remained open, as long as viewers wore masks. At the Riley in Greenfield, Ind., if you had your own mask, admission was 6 and 11 cents. If you needed the theater to provide one, admission went up to 10 or 15 cents.
The Riley, its advertisement said, had been disinfected. So had the Coliseum dance hall in Rock Island, Ill. “Aseptic spray, etc.,” said its advertisement, which reminded dancers to bring their masks. “Don’t forget the big Duck and Goose call this Saturday.”
Through the attempts to make wearing masks seem normal, positioned at stores alongside everyday things such as tobacco, mustache grooming and dancing, the grim truth persisted.
“The masks worn by millions were useless as designed and could not prevent influenza,” Barry wrote. “Only preventing exposure to the virus could.”"

Cut Out the Middle Man,"The scramble to replace vanishing revenue is forcing businesses to take extreme measures. In the U.K, a firm recently broke the revered convention that a company shouldn’t dilute its shareholders by hurriedly selling a massive stake in itself in the open market. It saved on bankers, lawyers, time and paperwork. One week on, this maverick approach has gained official acceptance.
Normally a big corporate share sale is about cutting debt or paying for a big takeover. There’s plenty of time to do this properly via a so-called rights offer: the lengthy process whereby investors get priority allocation on any new stock being sold (hence the “rights”). 
Today’s need for equity is different. Many companies suddenly have zero cash coming in due to measures aimed at combating the coronavirus. Their lenders may not help unless shareholders dig deep too. There’s no time to lose.
The solution that’s emerged is to flout British custom and follow U.S. practice instead: Just sell a big slab of shares, ideally to existing shareholders, but ultimately to whomever will take them. After all, anti-dilution protection is not enshrined in U.K. law but in guidance stating that share sales of more than 10% of the company should essentially be via rights offers. That guidance was sensibly revised on Wednesday, with the threshold lifted to 20% over the next six months. Bosses will need to explain why they’re forgoing a rights offer and still try hard to raise the equity from existing owners.
Airport caterer SSP Group Plc blazed the trail last week and sold a 20% stake in the market for 216 million pounds ($268 million). HSBC Holdings Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc simultaneously agreed to lend it 113 million pounds. Each slab of cash appeared to rely on the other being committed.
Sticking with the old guidance was not a realistic option. Investment banks could have agreed to underwrite a “standby” rights offer at a price so low it would have wiped out existing shareholders, for a tidy fee. With that backstop secured, an orderly fundraising might have been possible, for another fee. But SSP’s share price would have subsequently tumbled, and the proceeds would have taken weeks to land. Lenders could have then charged the earth for bridging the financing gap.
Why ever bother with a rights offer if you can just do what SSP did? Should nimble share placings become the norm? One argument against this is that small shareholders still get diluted. However in this case, they actually did OK: SSP shares rallied. The institutional shareholders who bought the deal paid a premium to SSP’s prior-day share price; there was no VIP bargain. Moreover, speedy share placings could also be made subject to clawback by smaller holders, with some tweaks to the current documentation requirements.
The real problem is many firms will need to raise even more than 20% of their share capital this year. Share offerings that big require a chunky prospectus anyway under European regulations. And at that size, the case for ignoring anti-dilution rights is weaker.
Shareholders know multiple demands for cash are looming. Companies should form an orderly queue, ask for no more and no less than they need, and choose their methods accordingly."

The central bank is expected to announce a new emergency facility to support municipal debt, part of the $2 trillion stimulus approved last week. It had the backing of progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans alike, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Mike Crapo. They’re urging the Fed and Treasury to move quickly.
The coronavirus pandemic has crimped sources of tax revenue for states and localities at a time when resources, including paramedics and hospitals, are being committed to combat the threat to public health.
In the next round of legislation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some congressional Democrats want to push further. They favor taking decisions about where to use the money out of the political realm and giving them solely to the independent Fed.
The notion has been circulating for months among progressives in Congress. If the law is changed, it would give the Fed another congressionally mandated goal -- beyond stable prices and maximum employment -- by designating the Federal Open Market Committee to be the buyer of last resort of the debt of troubled states and municipalities.
“If you want money to go somewhere quickly, everybody’s idea right now is to get the Fed involved,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington. “That doesn’t take into account that the Fed has to build these facilities and structures to do something they’ve never done before.”
Permanent Change
Legislation introduced by Democratic Senator Robert Menendez would create a permanent change to the Federal Reserve Act to allow the central bank to purchase municipal debt “under unusual and exigent circumstances” through direct purchases via open market operations.
Currently, the Fed and Treasury are operating under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act. It allows the Fed, with Treasury permission, to open a broad-based facility to support troubled areas of the financial markets in an emergency.
Municipal bonds have rallied in anticipation of the intervention. Last week was the best for state and local debt since 1982, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. A handful of debt issuers have been able to price deals in the last few days after billions in transactions were scuttled earlier this month, a signal that the market is starting to regain its footing.
The virus threatens the finances of U.S. states, cities and counties, which rely on taxes on income, sales and stock-market gains. With the much of the country on lockdown, that revenue has slowed to a trickle. New York, home of the most U.S. cases of Covid-19, is projected to lose between $10 billion and $15 billion of revenue in the fiscal year that starts April 1. Ohio state agencies are looking to cut spending by 20%, and Cincinnati is furloughing 1,700 city workers.
Eric Kim, head of state-government ratings at Fitch Ratings Inc., said the $150 billion set aside in the stimulus bill for state and local governments is limited to reimbursement and may not be spent.
Pandemic Hotspots
“Outside of pandemic hotspots like New York, new spending is not the problem for most states, but rather lost revenue brought on by severely reduced economic activity,” he said March 27.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently expanded the central bank’s lending authority to include support for corporations and medium-sized businesses. Democrats have had a long-standing interest, however, in the Fed using its power to operate in open markets to do something directly for troubled localities.
Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, had a sharp exchange with Powell in February over his authority to support municipal debt.
Fed’s Job
“Do you not believe that the governments of Detroit and Puerto Rico also play a vital role that should be preserved, even if a financial crisis makes it hard for them to borrow money?” Tlaib asked Powell.
“That’s not a job for the Fed,” Powell said. “Lending to state and local governments and supporting them when they’re in bankruptcy is not -- that’s not part of our mandate.”
Tlaib finished by saying: “We are going to strongly disagree.”
Pelosi has also taken an interest in Powell’s ability to directly support states and localities.
“I hope that in this next bill that we will be able to address the concerns of our state and local governments,” Pelosi told MSNBC on Tuesday. “We need to do more by way of our appropriations, by way of our tax code and by way of policy and also by way of the Fed.”"
"April 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/america-needs-empathetic-leadership-now-more-than-ever/2020/04/02/1f6935f2-750c-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html,The Washington Post,We’ve officially witnessed the total failure of empathy in presidential leadership,"Someday presidential historians will fully explore the defects of heart and character that led Donald Trump, in the midst of an unprecedented national crisis threatening hundreds of thousands of deaths, to brag that the television ratings for his afternoon briefings rivaled the “Bachelor” finale or “Monday Night Football.” This is not mere pettiness. It is clinical solipsism. Exploiting this type of tragedy in the cause of personal vanity reveals Trump’s spirit to be a vast, trackless wasteland. Trump seems incapable of imagining and reflecting the fears, suffering and grief of his fellow citizens. We have witnessed the total failure of empathy in presidential leadership.
So far, frankly, it hasn’t mattered very much. The main focus has been, appropriately, on the president’s lack of competence. We clearly have a medical and scientific A-team being supported by a White House D-team. Trump’s initial failure of urgency wasted weeks that could have been used in lifesaving preparations. His long holiday of denial hurt the country badly.
But the United States is now on the verge of events that will demonstrate the need for empathetic leadership. So far, many of the sacrifices imposed by the coronavirus crisis have been theoretical (except in the most dramatically affected areas). But even under the best-case scenarios, we are entering weeks of mounting fatalities. Before it all ends, many Americans will know someone who dies or faces severe illness. At the same time we will start counting and feeling the costs of an economy in suspended animation.
Why does empathetic leadership matter in this kind of moment? At the most basic level, it tries to redeem hardship for some greater good. When President Abraham Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, in the midst of so many fresh graves, he was making clear that those deaths were not random or purposeless. He dedicated unimaginable sacrifice to a transcendent purpose — the survival of self-government. By feeling and expressing grief, Lincoln could give it enduring meaning.
Two days after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, President George W. Bush spoke to then-New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New York Gov. George Pataki by phone in the Oval Office. Bush expressed his sympathy for those who were mourning (“I wish I could comfort every single family whose lives have been affected”) and urged people to treat Arab Americans with respect. He continued with barely controlled emotion: “I don’t think about myself right now. I think about the families, the children. I am a loving guy, and I am also someone, however, who has got a job to do, and I intend to do it. And this is a terrible moment. But this country will not relent until we have saved ourselves and others from the terrible tragedy that came upon America.” Channeling the nation’s emotions allowed Bush to direct them in a proper direction — away from domestic bigotry and toward a foreign enemy.
Empathic leadership also serves the purpose of reassuring vulnerable people that someone is on their side. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fireside chats convinced people in the bread lines of the Great Depression that an aristocratic president had their back. Following the March on Selma in March 1965, President Lyndon Johnson spoke to a joint session of Congress. He compared Selma to the sacrifices of the American Revolution and the Civil War. And he concluded: “Their cause must be our cause, too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.” In that moment, Johnson assured the civil right protesters that the American “we” encompassed their cause and that the president himself would be their advocate.
This is the type of unity that Trump endangers when he accuses his opponents of wanting to tank the economy, or ties presidential attention to the gratitude of governors, or throws out xenophobic gibes, or dedicates his briefing to the praise of flunkies, or accuses health professionals of stealing protective gear. There is a hole at the heart of Trump’s rhetoric where empathy belongs. How must the marginal in our society — prisoners, migrants, the homeless and destitute — view a president who seems most excited by stock market gains and welfare for big corporations?
It is not particularly helpful to urge the president to grow a soul. But empathy in times of crisis is not some altruistic add-on. It is the manner by which a nation’s suffering is given purpose, and a method of assuring the vulnerable they won’t be forgotten. If the president can’t feel it, he needs to fake it."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/02/crowdfunding-is-an-imperfect-weapon-against-pandemic/,The Washington Post,Crowdfunding is an imperfect weapon against the pandemic,"As the infection rate of covid-19 has exploded across the United States, the growth of charitable crowdfunding campaigns has seemed similarly exponential. More than 35,000 covid-19 related fundraisers have appeared on GoFundMe, the New York Times reported last week, raising $60 million. There are campaigns to support unemployed workers, to purchase personal protective equipment for health-care workers, and, of course, to cover personal medical expenses. Some are sponsored by influencers and celebrities; others by people struggling to just get by. The terrain of covid-19 crowdfunding is evolving rapidly, with Yelp, for example, trying to capitalize on the platform to offer unsolicited help to small businesses.
For those of us who have studied medical crowdfunding — and indeed for anyone well enough, physically and financially, to consider contributing to covid-19 campaigns — the cacophony of charitable appeals presents hard questions about how help should be sought and offered online. The depth of this impending economic and health crisis compels all of us to respond — but are donations to well-meaning campaigns just Band-Aids on bullet holes?
Because decades of government austerity measures have eroded this country’s already limited safety nets, many Americans are forced to seek help wherever they can find it. Even before the current crisis, medical crowdfunding campaigns were more prevalent in states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Similarly, we’ve seen precarious workers affected by covid-19 turning to crowdfunding as other systems have failed to protect their income, health coverage or benefits. As one uninsured crowdfunder seeking money for insulin told me last year, “That’s all you can count on ... taking a shot in the dark.”
What should not escape notice, as we scroll through pleas on social media, is how much of the covid-19 crisis was preventable. The health-care system safeguards that might have limited widespread infections were systematically undermined by deliberate political choices. Similarly, our reluctance to lower drug and health insurance prices and to expand health coverage makes insulin dependence an acute economic crisis for many Americans. It’s worth remembering that the bullet holes that crowdfunding seeks to patch arise from deliberate societal choices.
Crowdfunding is rarely a fair or ethical solution to complex problems. About 90 percent of medical campaigns fail to reach their goals — and those that succeed may not represent the most urgent or important needs. Each campaign competes in a marketplace of need for donor dollars and attention. This means that crowdfunding can amplify and reinforce contributors’ social and racial biases: For example, research shows that medical campaigns on behalf of black patients receive, on average, $22 less per donation than those for white patients.
As we confront many kinds of giving over the coming months — celebrity appeals, corporate largesse, government bailouts — we should remember civil rights activist Audre Lorde’s adage, “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” Philanthropy supports the existing power structure; it doesn’t contest it. To the extent that crowdfunding asks Americans to dedicate their resources to deploying Band-Aids, it distracts us from mobilizing to change the circumstances that create and worsen these crises.
Like a pressure-release valve, GoFundMe campaigns siphon off our grief, our rage, our capacity for mobilization, and direct them toward individualized, online giving. “Click here: Save a life,” we are told. Yet there are no donate buttons for a better disease surveillance system, or for better political leadership back in January, when the first U.S. covid-19 case was identified. Crowdfunding could not prevent the “testing fiasco” that writer Ed Yong described as the “single flaw that undermined every other countermeasure” in the nation.
There are alternatives; the United States is not only a country of individual philanthropists. In Seattle and New York and other cities, people are mobilizing to help one another — organizing food donation sites, supporting housebound residents and sharing crucial information. This country has a long history of such mutual aid, particularly among communities of color. We can learn from how the Black Panther Party organized community health clinics and food aid, and how people banded together after Hurricane Katrina. Mutual aid encourages us to both respond to urgent needs and to confront the structural forces that fuel our vulnerability. The ethic of mutual aid, as New York activist Mariame Kaba taught organizers last week, is solidarity, rather than philanthropy; it is justice, rather than pity.
Some efforts to respond to covid-19 may continue to rely on sites such as GoFundMe, but we must recognize that crowdfunding is an imperfect tool rather than a solution. If we are lucky, we will emerge from this crisis with a broader understanding of our capacities for mutual aid beyond hitting like, share and donate buttons. We will remember the importance of public health systems, social safety nets and health coverage for all. We will refocus our attention on the bullet holes, and not just the Band-Aids, in the fabric of our American systems."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/02/get-rid-political-party-conventions/,The Washington Post,"Get rid of political conventions. Not just this year, but forever.","The Democratic National Committee, we learned Thursday, has wisely decided against holding its convention as scheduled in July in Milwaukee. Bowing to the coronavirus threat, it has pushed the date back to Aug. 17, which is a week before the Republicans get together in Charlotte to nominate President Trump to a second term.
But here’s another Idea: Get rid of the conventions. Entirely. Not just this year but forever. They are gaudy, week-long infomercials, funded by lobbyists, offering but a few moments that can hold a decent-sized television audience. Taxpayers of the cities that host them are usually left holding a big bill.
Once upon a time, there was a reason to hold these quadrennial rituals. There was no primary process as we would recognize it today. Major-party conventions — the first of which was an 1831 gathering of the short-lived, anti-Jacksonian National Republicans in Baltimore — started as a reform measure to wrest power from the caucuses of congressmen and state legislators who decided who the party nominees would be.
Once states started holding primaries and caucuses in the 20th century, the importance of the conventions began to evaporate. Not until Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1932, did a presidential contender even show up in person to accept his party’s nomination. Since 1968, conventions have simply affirmed the nomination of the candidate who won the most delegates in the state contests.
Still, in just about every campaign season, we will hear predictions that this — finally! — will be the year in which we see a “brokered” convention. That bubble burst once again in 2020, when former vice president Joe Biden cleaned up against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Super Tuesday. The last convention that even went beyond a first ballot was the 1952 Democratic gathering that selected Illinois Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson II.
Conventions don’t do all that much to help bring about party unity, either.
When there has been a spirited contest for the nomination, conventions often become last-ditch opportunities for the losers to air their platforms and offer a sour reminder to their disappointed supporters of what could have been. Jimmy Carter had to chase Sen. Ted Kennedy around the Democratic convention stage to even get a handshake in 1980. Jesse Jackson’s soaring oratory in 1988 only reminded people of how bland Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was. Republican runner-up Pat Buchanan went full culture warrior at the 1992 GOP convention, doing what he could to erase the last traces of the kinder and gentler Republicanism of George H.W. Bush. And Sen. Ted Cruz, the second-place Republican finisher in 2016, pointedly withheld his endorsement of Donald Trump, telling the delegates, “Vote your conscience.”
This year, once the tedious roll call of the states comes to an end in Milwaukee, it is hard to imagine that Sanders supporters will be lining up to congratulate the Biden delegates.
And then there are the party platforms: Who even knows what is in these manifestos of their supposed positions on the issues? As Jill Lepore wrote in the New Yorker in 2016: “Platform-committee meetings are chest-thumping contests between warring clans within the parties; in exchange for conceding, defeated candidates tend to have a lot of influence over the platform.”
But actual nominees are not bound by them. Did Trump even read the 2016 platform?
So why not just ditch the conventions? Let each party buy a block of time on the networks in which its nominee can give his acceptance speech, accompanied by one of those heart-rending video retrospectives. The standard-bearers, their running mates and their collected families can join hands and raise them for the cameras. Maybe drop a few balloons and some confetti on them, just for old times' sake.
And then let the circus move on."

“Y’all, we are not Louisiana, we are not New York state, we are not California,” she said, suggesting that the fate of hard-hit parts of the country would not be shared by Alabama.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Parson said he was not inclined to “make a blanket policy,” adding, “It’s going to come down to individual responsibilities.”
And in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a statewide stay-at-home order this week under growing pressure as his state’s death toll mounted, a Tampa-area megachurch pastor who was arrested for holding services in violation of a local order announced Thursday he was considering reopening the church in time for Easter and is “praying and seeking the Lord for wisdom.”
“I will say, however, that the church cannot be closed indefinitely,” the Rev. Rodney Howard-Browne wrote on his website. “We believe that there are less restrictive means available to balance all the various interests.”
A growing number of states and cities are restricting Americans’ movements in response to a fast-spreading pandemic likely to claim hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide. But government and private-sector leaders across a large swath of the country remain defiant that the devastation unfolding in New York and other seemingly faraway cities should not curtail life in their own communities.
New York’s scramble to brace for peak crisis a siren for the rest of U.S.
In some cases, skeptics have been slow to acknowledge the science behind the spread of the novel coronavirus. In others, such as Florida, politicians took heed of demands from the business community, which lobbied DeSantis as recently as during a Monday webinar to balance medical imperatives with economic needs. Elsewhere, adamance about local autonomy was pronounced. Some, meanwhile, maintained that it was religious authority that mattered.
“While we do not know for certain what the future holds, or how long this disruption will last, we can all rest in knowing that God is in control,” the conservative Christian founder and chief executive of the craft store chain Hobby Lobby, which opened stores in a handful of places against state orders, wrote in a letter to his employees.
Experts are now warning that a group of governors in the South and the Great Plains — largely Republican-led states — risk acting too late.
Alabama, for example, has more than 1,100 cases, with just five counties untouched by the virus. New infections have risen as sharply as in California.
In some cases, the resistance has led to rising political tensions, with often Democratic mayors imposing orders of their own that they acknowledge have limited effect when surrounding jurisdictions do not act.
“As a city, we need to operate as if we could be anyone else,” said Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham, Ala. “I think we’re in the middle of a storm.”
Lyda Krewson, the mayor of St. Louis, said her city’s stay-at-home order was undermined by the absence of a blanket policy, warning, “We have a fluid society, frankly.”
“I feel like the entire country ought to be under a stay-at-home order,” Krewson said in an interview.
The pleas have not been from politicians alone. Joining Krew­son and others in appealing to the Missouri governor was the state’s medical association, which sent a letter to Parson saying a statewide order was the “only way to curb the exponential spread of covid-19 in Missouri.” In Texas, the state’s hospital and nurses associations sent a joint letter to the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, telling him, “The time has come for Texas to issue a statewide stay-at-home order.” Abbott announced a new statewide directive Tuesday but refused to call it a stay-at-home order.
Current and former emergency management officials said the delay would cost lives.
“Part of the problem is just reluctance to wrap your head around the fact that the numbers could get that bad that fast,” said W. Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator.
He singled out the South, saying, “It’s almost a different approach, waiting to know it’s bad. I’m afraid that by the time they have reports of cases, it’s already too late.”
A federal official involved in emergency management in a group of states across the Southeast echoed that assessment.
“We needed to be where we are now three weeks ago,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the response effort. “It’s like Hurricane Katrina is hitting all 50 states at the same time.”
Effective planning has been thwarted by the multiple models available to state officials, who choose to rely on certain numbers and not others, the official said, based on a “political decision that is out of the hands of the responders.”
The series of new orders announced this week leave about a dozen states without sweeping restrictions limiting travel to essential needs.
Interviews with mayors, business leaders and health officials in states where stay-at-home orders were recently imposed illustrated how decisive Tuesday’s White House briefing was to their thinking, as Trump struck a newly solemn tone and his advisers unveiled grim projections even with best-case mitigation efforts.
DeSantis acknowledged as much in remarks Wednesday, saying of his statewide order, “I did speak with the president about it.”
The industries exempted from his order, including landscaping and boating in addition to food service and others, resembled the catalogue of essential services requested by the Florida Chamber of Commerce, which sent a letter to DeSantis outlining its view of an appropriate government response on March 22. While slowing the outbreak was the “foremost priority,” wrote the Chamber’s president and chief executive, Mark Wilson, “we must be mindful that the policies intended to protect human health and curb the pandemic do not also cause an even worse effect on the economy and jobs.”
One Tampa Bay restaurant group is doing what it must to save the family business. It may not be enough.
Florida’s neighbor to the north also changed course Wednesday.
“At this point, I think it’s the right thing to do,” said Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, who had resisted a statewide order and whose top aide had taken to Facebook over the weekend to accuse local officials of “overreach” for directing residents to stay at home.
Kemp said he learned Tuesday that the virus was “transmitting before people see signs.”
For weeks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others have been warning about the disease’s spread in the absence of symptoms.
That cases could remain undetected was “quite apparent from what was going on in China,” said Andrew Reisman, president of the Georgia Medical Association and a member of the governor’s task force advising him on the pandemic. Still, Reisman said information about the virus was rapidly evolving and that “responsibility lies above all with individual people.”
Some of the people affected have been those involved in emergency response.
Gracia Szczech, the regional FEMA administrator based in Atlanta, alerted staff in an email Monday of an employee’s positive test — the third in the Atlanta office, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.
A FEMA spokesperson said: “As staff have reported diagnoses, FEMA regional offices have implemented CDC approved and recommended cleaning of the workspace. They also continue to advise all staff on mitigation and safety measures to protect themselves and others from the virus.”
Cody Hall, a spokesman for Kemp, said updated CDC guidance, in addition to new modeling and projections about hospital capacity, shifted the governor’s thinking.
Tom Wolf, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, also issued a statewide order Wednesday, calling it the “most prudent option” as the number of cases in his state surpassed 5,000.
After initially barring local jurisdictions from ordering residents to stay at home, Arizona’s governor, Republican Doug Ducey, this week reversed himself and issued a statewide order.
But Will Humble, a former director of the state’s health department, said it was unenforceable.
“It says it’s a stay-at-home order, but try to find something that’s not exempted that wasn’t already closed,” he said.
Aides to the governor and state’s health director didn’t respond to requests for comment. Governor’s offices in Missouri and Oklahoma also didn’t respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Public Health, Arrol Sheehan, said the state “continues to review situations in other states, follow our plans, update our plans, coordinate with health-care and community partners and advise our citizens regarding the measures we can take to reduce the spread of this virus.”
Within states that have issued sweeping directives, there has also been defiance from businesses, as well as religious leaders and vacationers.
The decision by Hobby Lobby to reopen stores in multiple states that had ordered nonessential businesses closed prompted state law enforcement officials to send cease-and-desist letters to the company, which is based in Oklahoma City. Hobby Lobby is known for its successful challenge to a component of the Affordable Care Act requiring family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for contraception.
Two employees of the chain, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are still employed by a store, provided images of signs in Hobby Lobby store windows in Ohio and Massachusetts contending the business was “operating as essential” because it was offering “PPE mask supplies” and “various components for at-home small businesses.”
Hobby Lobby’s corporate office did not respond to a request for comment.
There were other, more recreational reasons for rule-breaking, including spring-break excursions.
Dan Gelber, the mayor of Miami Beach, said macabre scenes out of New York helped his constituents understand the need for strict measures, including the stay-at-home order issued for his city more than a week ago.
“It would have made sense to start substantial social distancing in early March,” the mayor said. “But there was no messaging for that. And no one saw the threat it became literally days later.”"

Volcker, who died in 2019, nailed it — and for the EU in 2020 just as in 2012.
Volcker was referring to a controversy about “euro bonds,” as they were called then, which has now resurfaced under the label (what else?) “coronabonds.” The circumstances are different — a sovereign debt crisis then, a pandemic now — but the idea is the same.
The euro area would raise new debt for which all 19 members of the currency union would be jointly and severally liable. Countries such as Italy and Spain, which are suffering the most from the coronavirus, would get cheaper access to the money they need to recover. States like Germany, which currently borrow at negative rates, would pay only trivially higher interest costs. What better way to finally show European solidarity?
If only it were that easy. As it stands, only nine members of the euro area support coronabonds. That leaves 10 unconvinced. Germany is among them, of course. The bluntest rejection has come from the Dutch.
That has infuriated many southerners. A group of Italian politicians this week took out a full-page ad in a German newspaper, accusing the Dutch of “a lack of ethics and solidarity,” and unsubtly reminding the Germans of the solidarity Europe showed them after the war, when Germany’s debts were forgiven or restructured at a conference in 1953.
So tempers are boiling once again. As indeed they were in 1790, when intellectual titans including Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson had a similar debate, the one Volcker had in mind. Hamilton, America’s first treasury secretary, wanted to assume the debts of the 13 states that had recently joined together to fight off the Brits. Jefferson and his followers were against the idea, fearing that the federal government would become a behemoth threatening the liberties of the states.
Both were right. The U.S. did assume the states’ debts, thus seeding today’s huge Treasury-bond market. And the federal government did balloon, as it took on ever more functions over time, especially after the New Deal of the 1930s. But the result was the United States of America as we know it.
So what European dilemma was Volcker putting his finger on with his analogy? Since it started in the 1950s, the European project also aimed, at least in theory, to become a United States of Europe, as implied in the phrase “ever closer union.” Currency union was a big step in that direction. To work, it now requires full banking, capital-markets and fiscal unions. European bonds to rival U.S. Treasuries would seem like the way to go.
The devil’s in the differences. Hamilton cleanly took the debts from the states and transferred them to a different entity, the federal government. That same entity was simultaneously handed the power to raise tax revenues to repay its new debt. In this role it was given legitimacy by having the people’s and states’ representatives in Congress deciding those taxes.
Moreover, the U.S. from that point on stuck to a much more ruthless form of Europe’s “no-bailout” rule. The federal government has never rescued a state, letting several go bankrupt in the 1840s. The states understood they were fiscally on their own, and all but Vermont eventually gave themselves balanced-budget rules not unlike Germany’s. In turn, the federal government took on functions such as fiscal policy to manage aggregate demand.
By contrast, the thinking behind euro bonds had totally different origins. As originally envisioned, they would still be issued by the member states but guaranteed by all countries in the euro area. In effect, this would be like California selling debt and all 50 U.S. states vouching for it. How enthusiastic would the Texans be about that? And how delighted would the Californians be when the Texans show up in Sacramento to tell them how to cut the Golden State’s budget? Now swap in Italians for Californians and Germans for Texans, and you get the idea.
The proposals for euro bonds kept changing subsequently (this overview counts at least eight versions). But no matter the design, they kept that crucial divergence from Hamilton’s clean cut. The most prominent idea is to divide the debt of member states into two tranches, blue bonds worth up to 60% of each nation’s GDP and red bonds for everything in excess. The blue bonds would be “mutualized,” perhaps jointly issued and certainly guaranteed by all, and thus be rated AAA. The red bonds would be junior and lack the common liability, and rated lower.
But the tax revenues to repay the bonds would still be harvested by the individual member states, and national legislatures would still decide how to tax and spend. Unsurprisingly, the Dutch, Germans, Austrians and Finns, among others, fear that the southern parliaments may just tax too little and spend too much, knowing that in a pinch the northern tax euros will repay their creditors. Academics call this “moral hazard.” To mitigate it, the north would insist on more rigid fiscal rules, but Rome and Madrid wouldn’t be happy about those. It’s Texans and Californians again.
Here, then, are two of the many ways in which the euro area, and perhaps the whole EU, could blow up in the coming generation. In the first scenario, the north obstinately balks at all forms of “mutual” debt issuance. Southerners, resenting this lack of solidarity, turn to nationalist and Brussels-bashing populists like Italy’s Matteo Salvini, who take their countries out of the euro and maybe out of the EU, possibly accepting cash from China instead, or whichever new friend they can find.
In the second scenario, the north agrees to mutualized debt, starting with coronabonds and then expanding from there. But the south is humiliated by the austerity rules imposed from Brussels once the conoravirus depression is over. And northerners settle on the narrative of the dreaded “transfer union,” in which their hard-earned tax euros flow into the bottomless pit of the Mezziogiorno. Now it’s the north that turns to nationalist and Brussels-bashing populists and leaves the EU.
So what’s needed is indeed Hamilton bonds. Europe must take that historic step and issue bonds, levy direct taxes, and vote on all of this at the top — meaning federal — level. In effect, the euro area needs a government, with a treasurer and a legislature, which could be a subgroup of the European Parliament. It could start small, but over time would have to take roles from the states (like unemployment insurance, say).
All this would require changes in Europe’s treaties and, more importantly, minds. Just as it did in Hamilton’s time. But maybe that’s the ultimate difference: The Americans in 1790 really did want a United States, whereas the Europeans of 2020 don’t. If Volcker were around, he would repeat: There’s no European Hamilton in sight. Unfortunately, this means that the EU only has bad options."

About 10 million Americans lost their jobs over the past two weeks, based on initial jobless claims reported Thursday -- far exceeding forecasts. The numbers mean unemployment may already be approaching 10%, nearly matching its peak following the financial crisis of 2008-09, as fallout from the contagion ravages the labor market.
“I was anticipating that in the first half of the year we were going to have some really bad numbers, and seeing that number today just confirms how bad it is,” Mester said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg News.
“You don’t like to see those numbers because it means people really are impacted by this,” she said. “It will take some time to get it back down, and we’ll see a big hit to output growth in the second quarter because we’ve shut the economy down.”
The U.S. central bank is racing to prepare additional emergency programs, on top of the six it has already announced. One, the Main Street Lending Program, will aim to deliver loans to small-and-mid-sized businesses.
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said Wednesday that facility wouldn’t be ready for “another couple weeks.”
Mester said she couldn’t provide any more information on the timing or details of the program.
‘Aid Now’
“People and businesses need aid now,” she said. “I can tell you we understand the sense of urgency and the Fed is working as quickly as possible.”
Mester was even more careful when asked when the Fed might introduce a facility to purchase debt issued by cities and states. The recently passed congressional aid package instructs the U.S. Treasury Department to implement a program aiding states and municipalities. Many expect the Treasury will do so by backstopping a Fed lending facility.
“This is another one of those things we’re working on to see what it makes sense to do,” she said.
“We can do some things, perhaps, at the Fed to make sure the markets are working, but I think the direct transfers to state and local governments will come probably from the Treasury,” she added.
The Cleveland Fed chief, who votes this year on the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, said the Fed’s most important job remains keeping markets functioning.
FOMC Dissent
Concern over market disruption, particularly in the Treasury market, prompted Mester to dissent on March 15 when the FOMC voted to slash its benchmark interest rate by 1 percentage point close to zero.
“The illiquidity was really affecting any kind of hope for transmission of a monetary policy cut” at that point, Mester said. “Also there was social distancing going on, which meant any kind of rate cut wasn’t going to spur activity.”
She said there’s been progress in restoring market liquidity, “but I still think that’s where our focus really has to be continuing.”
Mester, who was director of research at the Philadelphia Fed during the financial crisis of 2008-09, said she hasn’t found herself shocked by anything that’s unfolded over the past month.
“I find it very depressing that we are in this situation, but I guess I’ve been buoyed by the fact that this is really an all-hands-on-deck situation,” she said. “There really is a sense of everyone working together to get through this shock that no one anticipated.”"

The Chinese government has implemented the most ambitious quarantine in modern times, as health care workers knock on doors in search of infected people and travelers in airports across the world are scanned for signs of fever. The effort is complicated by the virus’s incubation period of up to two weeks -- a time when the infected person may have no symptoms but still be contagious -- as well as the challenge of identifying those with such mild cases they don’t realize they are ill. Here’s a breakdown of the work to rein in what’s been dubbed 2019-nCoV, for 2019 novel coronavirus:
Monitoring
Within China: Officials said they would track down people who left Wuhan, a city of 11 million, before the quarantine was imposed, as many migrant workers headed back to the countryside to celebrate the Lunar New Year with their families. Officials said they would be registered, visited frequently by medical personnel and taken for treatment if symptoms developed. Xinhua reported that health officials in Beijing asked those returning to Wuhan from anywhere to stay at home for two weeks, record their temperature and seek treatment if they develop a cough or fever. But a shortage of testing kits and overworked hospital staff are straining the health care system, hampering efforts to accurately track how many people have the pathogen. And there’s evidence that people may be contagious even when asymptomatic.
Elsewhere: Airports globally and border crossings with China have implemented monitoring systems including thermal scanners and questionnaires in an effort to catch cases early. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it would funnel all air traffic from China through certain airports, where passengers would be screened for fevers or other symptoms. The drawback to this approach, however, is that it may miss people coming into the U.S. from places other than China who might have been infected by asymptomatic patients during the journey. The passengers are given cards with details about what to watch for. Social media and traditional news outlets have also spread the word. The first two patients identified in the U.S. sought medical attention on their own accord because they were concerned that they might be infected, showing that awareness levels are high.
Contact tracing
When a new case is identified, the patient is put in isolation, often in a hospital, to prevent him or her from spreading the germs. A medical worker takes a thorough history, trying to identify every person who has been within 6 feet (2 meters) of the patient since symptoms emerged. According to the WHO, Chinese authorities place close contacts (family members and others living in the patient’s home, co-workers, possible care-givers and others) under medical observation, which may include isolation at home with regular temperature checks. If there are no symptoms after 14 days, the contacts are released, the WHO said. Other potential contacts could be neighbors, fellow passengers on public transportation, people who attended the same social events, shopped or visited doctors at the same time. Breaking the chain of transmission is what officials believe will ultimately curtail the outbreak and prevent a pandemic, which is an epidemic of global proportions.
Isolation
Isolation is a tricky issue because it’s unclear how well it works or if it’s been put in place quickly enough. The most critical time for isolation is when an infected person sheds the virus, essentially putting it out into the world. Scientists believe the virus is spread primarily through droplets that could be emitted by an infected person’s cough and transferred to their hands or surfaces and objects. There’s a theoretical risk that it could spread through fine aerosol particles and feces. Chinese authorities have said it’s possible people who are still incubating the virus and show no symptoms may spread it. One such case emerged in Germany linked to a company training event that was attended by an employee visiting from China who had no symptoms of disease during her stay. There have been cases reported where the virus has spread along a four-person chain, indicating that it’s more transmissible than earlier thought. Some of the most vulnerable people are the health care workers caring for seriously ill patients; 15 cases occurred among workers at a single hospital in Wuhan.
Travel restrictions
Hong Kong, the international financial center that functions with some autonomy from China, announced travel restrictions from the mainland. Singapore, the Philippines and New Zealand banned visitors from China, while South Korea, Iraq, Italy and Indonesia announced travel restrictions. Airlines reduced scheduled flights to and from China in preparation for lengthy shutdowns of service, with Delta, United and American Airlines following the lead of British Airways, Air France and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. United and American said they would not resume until late March, and Delta not until April. The U.S. State Department warned U.S. citizens against travel to China and said it was helping Americans in Wuhan get out of China. The U.S. declared a public health emergency and said that starting Feb. 2 it would bar entry to most foreign nationals who have been in China within two weeks of their arrival to the U.S.
Quarantines
Inside China: the government has imposed a quarantine on Wuhan and more than a dozen other cities in the region, a travel ban covering in excess of 50 million people. The move came ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday period, when an estimated 3 billion trips are made, about 15 million in Wuhan alone. The mayor estimated about 5 million residents left before the Jan. 23 lockdown, according to media reports. Wenzhou, a port city of 9 million people, became the first city outside central Hubei province to impose quarantine measures, telling families that only one person will be allowed out of the house every two days to shop for necessities. Wenzhou is in Zhejiang province, which had the highest number of confirmed cases outside Hubei.
Elsewhere: The CDC said that it was putting 195 Americans who had been repatriated from the outbreak’s center under federal quarantine at an Air Force base in California, the first such effort since the 1960s. All Americans who had been in Hubei province during the two weeks before their arrival would also be subject to quarantine. Citizens returning from elsewhere in China will be subject to screening, and are being asked to stay at home for two weeks while being monitored. Some health officials warned that in modern times, quarantines have yielded limited results. Toronto’s use of quarantine wasn’t effective in slowing the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004 there, Richard Schabas, a former public-health physician who was Ontario’s chief medical officer from 1987 to 1997, concluded in a study in 2004. An impoverished neighborhood in Liberia quarantined during an Ebola outbreak in 2014 responded with violent riots.
Testing
China sequenced the virus’s genome within days of detecting the outbreak and on Jan. 10 posted the information to public databases widely used by researchers. That contrasts with the months of delay seen with its response to the 2002 outbreak of SARS. Speedy access to the new virus’s genetic fingerprint allowed health officials in Japan and Thailand to quickly confirm cases that had been exported from China, followed by the U.S., France and other countries. Still, the process isn’t easy. Medical staff must take swabs from the nose and throat of potentially infected patients, along with blood samples, and send them to laboratories that are equipped to do genetic sequencing. While the work can take four to six hours, shipping the swabs to the laboratory can take much longer. Chinese health officials approved two new kits on Jan. 28, in addition to the existing four types, according to Xinhua News Agency. One of the new kits can give results in about 30 minutes, according to Technology Daily. In the U.S., the only facility currently conducting the work is at the CDC in Atlanta. Researchers are working to develop a faster process that can be done closer to the patient’s bedside.
Vaccines and Drug Therapies
Antiviral drugs that have shown signs of helping control other types of coronaviruses, such as remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir, are being examined to see if they offer any help for those infected with 2019-nCoV. Pharmaceutical companies including Moderna Inc. and Novavax Inc. say they have begun work on a potential vaccine. Health officials say a version might be available for the first stages of human testing in as little as three months. But developing an effective vaccine generally takes years."

Health-care workers are engaged in what is more and more often being described as a “war” against the covid-19 pandemic, and the casualties are mounting. In China, an estimated 3,000 health-care workers have been infected by the virus responsible for covid-19; at least 22 have died. In Italy’s Lombardy region, 1 in 5 health-care professionals has become infected, and many fear the United States could soon be headed in that same direction. More than 50 of Italy’s doctors are already confirmed dead. Domestically, we lost our first physicians and nurses to covid-19 two weeks ago. With dozens more surely to follow, when is enough, enough?
Being a resident physician in internal medicine, I work as part of a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses and other health professionals. For us, caring for patients with covid-19 on the hospital floors and in the intensive care units has become our new norm. And as our direct contact with infected patients has exponentially increased over the past few weeks, the water cooler chatter has heated up. We wonder aloud what we’re going to do when we run out of personal protective equipment (PPE), where we’re going to quarantine ourselves when we get sick, and how best to keep our loved ones safe.
As Thomas Kirsch, an emergency physician in Washington, put it in a recent Atlantic article: “How much risk do health-care workers have to take? Or, more bluntly: How many of us will die before we start to walk away from our jobs?”
Hazard pay is loosely defined by the Labor Department as “additional pay for performing hazardous duty or work involving physical hardship.” With or without proper PPE, health-care workers are putting their physical health on the line every day during this pandemic when they leave their shelters and families to treat those with covid-19.
If you have any doubt, the proof is in a viral tweet that reveals the emblematic bruises — lines of capillaries shattered under the pressure of an N95 mask — now marking the faces of Italy’s strained health-care workers. And they are the lucky ones, for at least they’re still alive.
Pandemics do not spare those who care for the sick. In 2003, nearly half (44 percent) of SARS infections in Toronto were health-care workers. Our jobs, by their very nature, put us at great risk for exposure to novel infectious diseases. We are in proximity to known infected people and spend a disproportionately large amount of time with these infected people compared with the general public, both known risk factors for contracting covid-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Face mask shortage prompts CDC to loosen guidelines
The federal government, meanwhile, has exacerbated these inherent hazards of our work by failing to secure and distribute PPE to essential health-care personnel. For instance, while the Strategic National Stockpile of N95 respirators was already known to be woefully inadequate at a total of 17 million masks, many of these masks were recently found to be past their expiration date.
Perhaps revelations such as these are what prompted the CDC to ultimately encourage health-care institutions to use expired masks anyway, despite acknowledging that they “might not perform to the requirements for which they were certified.”
Still, many of America’s health-care professionals are at the front lines of this pandemic with far less effective PPE than an expired respirator. Some are wearing the once-ubiquitous surgical mask, which doesn’t filter out airborne particles like N95 respirators do.
But many health-care institutions are already running short on these, too. Where some practitioners were previously requiring a dozen or more disposable face masks per shift, we are now being relegated to one per week. Others of us, left with no better option, may be soon forced to resort to the CDC’s latest contingency “plan” — using homemade masks, bandannas and scarfs as PPE.
By armoring our front lines with mere swaths of cloth, shown in the medical literature to be nearly 97 percent ineffective, we are armoring our only hope with little more than a false sense of security. If we cannot properly equip them, should we not at least properly pay them?
Retail and supermarket employees — essential staff just like health-care workers — are already beginning to lobby for hazard pay. J.M. Smucker (yes, Smucker’s like the jelly) announced March 23 that it would be granting hazard pay for its 5,700 employees “serving on the ground.”
Doctors started calling for hazard pay for front-line clinicians in mid-March. One district of the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees has filed a complaint against a New Mexico hospital for refusing to enter negotiations for hazard pay for its employees. And in the same amount of time, a Change.org petition for hazard pay for nurses, doctors, and other health-care professionals has racked up nearly 400,000 signatures.
Politicians, too, are catching on to the idea of hazard pay for those on the front lines. On March 30, President Trump said in a “Fox & Friends” interview that his administration was “looking at” providing health-care workers with hazard pay through a future relief package. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed, saying in a subsequent Fox Business Network interview that it was “definitely something we’ll put in the next bill.”
On the Democratic side of the aisle, Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Joaquin Castro (Tex.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) have taken to Twitter to voice their support for including hazard pay for health-care workers in the next coronavirus stimulus package.
Political rhetoric notwithstanding, let me be clear: This is not just about money. Far more than money, I want people to wash their hands and to stay home, and when they come into the hospital, I want access to appropriate PPE to treat them with.
But for the phlebotomists who have to expose themselves to draw the blood tests I order, for the respiratory therapists who have to change the ventilator settings I request, for the nurses who have to dispense the medications I prescribe, and for my fellow residents who will have to cover my shifts when I inevitably get sick, I want hazard pay — for them and for their families.
This is about showing support for our health-care workers during a pandemic in the same way we support our troops during a war. The American people are good people, which we’ve already seen in our hobbyists sewing homemade masks, philanthropists donating to research efforts, and corporations switching gears (quite literally) to produce ventilators and PPE.
Commensurately, let us not delay in honoring our nation’s health-care workers — my colleagues and friends — as they risk their lives battling for our collective health on the front lines of the covid-19 pandemic."

I am a physician, a dermatology resident, in New York City, who has volunteered to help in a hospital emergency department, intensive care unit and elsewhere during the covid-19 emergency. Strictly speaking, a physician’s duties are to diagnose and treat a patient’s illness or injury. The president’s comment brought to mind all the times I have stepped outside of my physician role — as any physician would do — to care for my patients.
I am not a phlebotomist, but when my patient needs a lab test, and the phlebotomist has gone home and it’s outside a nurse’s duties, I draw my patient’s blood.
I am not a secretary, but I work until 10 most nights to document every patient encounter in the electronic medical record.
I am not a nurse, but when I learn that my patient’s dressings have not been changed on time, I stay to do it myself.
I am not patient support services, but I wait on hold for hours with insurance companies to obtain prior authorization for my patient’s medications.
I am not a scheduler, but I respond to requests for expedited appointments, even when it means being awoken at 3 a.m. by the emergency department asking to accommodate a patient with an eczema flare-up.
I am not an ICU physician, but when hospitals are overwhelmed with sick patients during a pandemic, I pull out my stethoscope and stand by when asked to help out in the intensive care unit.
If physicians refused to complete work that is outside of their strict job description, the health-care system would collapse. Physicians know this to be true, and so does the government. The covid-19 pandemic has provided some of the most extreme examples of health-care professionals stretching their roles and risking their lives to care for their patients. Normally, a mask is discarded after every patient encounter; now, we are given one mask to use for an entire week.
For two years, as an undergraduate student, I served as a volunteer emergency medical technician for a local EMT squad. During our training, the importance of scene safety and body-substance isolation were drilled into us: We were not to enter a situation without first ensuring our own health and safety. If you get hurt, not only are you unable to help others, but who is going to help you? At best, you become a burden to your team.
In some ways, it feels as if we are now being asked to walk into a burning building. I trust myself to be careful and stay safe, but I am in a position I would have found unimaginable a month ago.
Now, when our lives depend on it, the president is not pulling out all the stops to bring us proper personal protective equipment and ventilators for our patients.

With most of President Trump’s hotels and clubs closed amid stay-at-home orders around the world, the Trump Organization has responded by slashing costs, much like other companies in the hospitality and tourism industries. The Trump Organization has laid off or furloughed employees at hotels in New York, the District of Columbia, Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas, Vancouver and Honolulu, according to public filings and people familiar with the properties, including union officials.
Seventeen of Trump’s clubs and hotels have closed. The remainder of Trump properties are operating at a fraction of their normal capacity: hotels running with restaurants closed, golf clubs operating with clubhouses shut down, and golfers warned not to share carts or touch the flagsticks.
All told, the closed properties generated an average of $650,000 in revenue for Trump per day, according to Trump’s past financial disclosures.
That economic strain has pushed Trump Organization officials to inquire about possible relief, at least temporarily, from the company’s financial obligations at one of its properties.
In Palm Beach County, Fla., the Trump Organization has not paid rent of $54,534.25 that was due April 1 on land it leases from the county government for the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, a county representative said Friday.
The Trump Organization said it has until April 10 to make the monthly payment without penalty.
“Because payment has not become due, and in light of Governor’s DeSantis’ executive order shutting down businesses throughout the State of Florida as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, the County advised us to refrain from making payment until they have finalized their policy for the handling of their numerous leases,” Alan Garten, a Trump Organization executive, said in a statement. “As soon as the County finalizes its guidance, we will, of course, fully and timely comply with its directives as well as continue to comply with the requirements of the lease.”
Palm Beach County officials did not respond to a question about Garten’s comment that the company was advised not to make the payment.
The West Palm Beach golf club sits on county land, and the Trump Organization pays $995,000 per year for two leases that pertain to one 18-hole and one nine-hole course, according to county officials. No monthly payment had been received on the 18-hole lease, which is administered by the county airports department, said Nicole Ferris, a county spokeswoman. She did not respond to questions about the second rent payment, of $33,804.88, that also was due April 1.
On March 25 — the same day that Trump’s Palm Beach golf club closed — Ed Raymundo, director of finance for the Trump Organization’s Florida properties, wrote an email to a Palm Beach County government official asking how the county intended to handle “the required rent installment” and suggested times were difficult for the club, according to a copy of emails obtained as part of a public-records request.
Raymundo wrote that DeSantis’s executive order closing nonessential bars and restaurants had “resulted in the cancellation of events and forced the Club to close many of it’s amenities leaving limited services available to our members.”
“In addition, with many New York-based members, the Governor’s most recent order requiring individuals traveling from the tri-state area to self-quarantine further hampers our operation,” Raymundo wrote. “Your direction in this is greatly appreciated.”
On March 31, Ray Walter, deputy director for real estate and concessions with the Palm Beach County airports department, wrote to Raymundo saying that “we are unable to forgive rental” but that a deferment may be possible “on a short-term basis in the midst of the current state of closure” and that “it is critical for us to keep the dialogue open.”
“I anticipate we will have more direction in the coming days or weeks,” Walter wrote to Raymundo.
He added that his department “does not have delegated authority to waive conditions, therefore resolution would need to be approved by the Board of County Commissioners, and resolution such as a short-term deferment would need to be consistent with all similarly-situated tenants.”
One county commissioner, Hal Valeche, wrote in an email that “the Commission has not discussed this or, to my knowledge, been apprised of it, so no decisions have been made.”
The next board meeting is scheduled for Tuesday.
As of Friday, 17 of Trump’s 24 clubs and hotels around the world were closed. The latest to close was Trump’s hotel in Vancouver, Canada — which announced its closure Thursday.
Trump’s business partner in that hotel, Joo Kim Tiah, said in an email, “With what is happening in the world right now, no hotel company or hotel is immune or spared.”
Tiah said that 213 workers had been laid off and 18 kept on, with 11 of those working reduced hours.
In Chicago, the Trump hotel told investors on Friday that it had made the “heartbreaking decision to” lay off two-thirds of its staff, required the remaining staff to work on two to three days a week, and suspended 401(k) contributions for all. Even the lights had been turned down to save money. “In an effort to conserve energy, most common areas . . . are illuminated and heated at a minimum level,” the hotel told its investors in a letter obtained by The Washington Post.
With the properties closed, the company faces significant costs.
Over the next month, Trump properties will owe more than $1.8 million in property-tax bills from local jurisdictions, according to a Post analysis of tax records.
The company also has to pay an April bill to New York City, related to ice rinks, a carousel and a golf course that the company runs under city contracts. A representative of the city parks department said Friday that “they do not have a past due payment at this time” but declined to say more.
The company has been trying to sell its D.C. hotel lease since late last year, an effort that has been sidelined by the pandemic."

JPMorgan Chase & Co. started taking applications Friday afternoon after warning clients Thursday night it was still awaiting guidance and might not be ready the following day. Bank of America Corp. initially took applications only from its existing small-business borrowers but later said it would broaden its lending after the practice sparked criticism.
Friday was the first day that American small businesses hit by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could start applying for loans under a $349 billion program included in a $2 trillion stimulus package passed last month aimed at shoring up an economy.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said more than 800 lenders, mostly community banks, participated on Friday and that he expects all big banks will be accepting applications starting next week. He promised that if the fund runs out of money, he’ll ask Congress for more.
“I know there’s a lot of hard-working small businesses that couldn’t get their applications processed this week,” Mnuchin said on Fox Business. “They shouldn’t worry about it.”
There have been at least 17,503 loans valued at more than $5.4 billion, U.S. Small Business Administration Administrator Jovita Carranza tweeted on Friday night.
The roll-out has been plagued by uncertainty, partly because of its magnitude and the urgency to get money to financially distressed small business owners before they’re forced to shut down permanently. After the government announced that the program would launch Friday with potentially millions of applications that could be processed quickly -- even the same day -- lenders said they lacked enough guidance.
First applicants reported widely different experiences. Some got error messages when trying to apply online, another has been trying since 4 a.m. in the morning, in vain, while two Bank of America small-business clients said they got through quickly and smoothly.
‘Unacceptable’ Delays
The National Federation of Independent Business, the largest group representing small businesses in the country, said it was hearing from too many firms that were being shut out of the program and called on lenders and the government to change that immediately.
“These small businesses did their due diligence and were ready this morning, but are hearing ‘no,”’ NFIB President Brad Close said in a statement. “The current delays are unacceptable, and hurt those that need the help most – very small businesses that find themselves in the worst of financial circumstances.”
Wells Fargo was not accepting applications as of Friday afternoon, according to its website. The bank is working “as quickly as possible to be ready to assist small business customers,” spokesperson Kate Pulley said via email.
Huntington Bancshares Inc. Chief Executive Steve Steinour said in an interview early Friday afternoon that the lender would be taking applications “momentarily” and expects they’ll “be going seven days a week from now until June 30.”
The Columbus, Ohio-based firm has assigned more than twice its normal SBA staffing levels to work on the program, and Steinour said he’s expecting thousands of applications. Money should start going out to small businesses early next week, he said.
Lenders “have to make sure we’re fully complying with the guidelines,” Steinour said. “By the end of next week, we’ll be hitting a really productive stride,” he said.
The nation’s credit unions early Friday were still seeking guidance on how they can participate. The National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions had yet to hear of any of its members having extended one of the SBA loans through 12:30 p.m., said Carrie Hunt, executive vice president of government affairs.
Some smaller banks also said they’re weren’t ready until they got more guidance about processing the loans from Treasury and the SBA, the agency in charge of the program. Fountainhead Commercial Capital, a national, non-bank lender that specializes in SBA loans, won’t be participating on Friday because the guidance so far is still “insufficient to most in the lending community,” said Chris Hurn, founder and chief executive.
“We truly hope that SBA will provide the necessary guidance we need very shortly, so we can begin processing loan applications, perhaps in a matter of hours thereafter,” Hurn said in a statement.
The initiative, called the Paycheck Protection Program, is meant to help small businesses keep workers on payrolls by offering loans of as much as $10 million with the portion used for payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent and utility payments for two months forgivable if firms retain and rehire employees. The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits surged on Thursday and reached about 10 million over the last two weeks.
Wahid Nassar, who runs a restaurant in the Highlands, New Jersey, said he tried going online Friday morning to apply for the loan through his lender, Bank of America, but repeatedly got error messages. “There’s so much confusion and hard to get a straight answer from anyone right now,” he said.But Joseph Colangelo, the chief executive officer of Boxcar Inc., a Chatham, New Jersey-based startup whose app offers parking and bus service, had better luck. He said he found the application online, and since he was already logged into the Bank of America website, it took him only 10 minutes to complete. The site said the bank would be in touch with him if it needed further information, he said.“It was so slick,” Colangelo said. “I was very impressed.”At International Quality Consultants Inc. in Butler, Pennsylvania, Chief Executive Officer Gail Paserba was anxiously waiting to submit an application for a loan after seeing about half the company’s business stall. As of midday Friday, its financial institution, PNC Financial Services Group Inc., needed to send an email to continue the process, she said.Paserba said the company, which does inspections and audits for heavy industry, has been reducing hours for some its 67 employees the past two weeks but decided to pay them the full amount in anticipation of receiving federal assistance. While she’s worried about the loan being delayed, she said she’s gotten good guidance from financial institutions and business groups.“As crazy as it has been, the information has been consistent,” Paserba said. “I have a headache; it’s not a migraine.”
Earlier in the week, there were doubts about how many lenders would participate because they originally believed they would be able to charge interest of as much as 4% and were dismayed when the government set the rate at 0.5% -- a rate below many banks’ own costs of funds, said Julie Huston, chief executive of Immito LLC, an SBA lender backed by a nonprofit community development group. By Thursday, Mnuchin announced the government had bumped up the allowable interest rate to 1%.
While banks can tap into the Federal Reserve’s “discount window” at 0.25%, many lenders don’t access the Fed money because of conditions on its use. Often, the next lowest-cost source of funds is the Federal Home Loan Bank at about 0.75%, said Huston, also chairwoman of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders.
Some of the largest financial institutions have the financial might to issue loans to keep their customers afloat, potentially even taking a loss to do so, but “what happens to everyone else?” Huston said Thursday ahead of the change in interest rates.
Advocates for small businesses have also said the $349 billion won’t be nearly enough to meet demand, and that many firms -- especially mom-and-pop shops that don’t have an established relationship with a lender -- could get beaten out for funding. Some lenders have said they’ll only take applications from existing clients.
Live Oak Banking Co., ranked by SBA as its most active lender, has been gathering payroll information from its 4,000 existing customers and processed its first loan at 4 a.m. on Friday, President Huntley Garriott said in an interview. The bank plans focus on its existing customers first “and we will address the rest of the world second,” Chief Executive Chip Mahan said in the interview.
By one estimate, small businesses may need more than $1 trillion to replace lost revenue over the next three months, and some lenders believe as much as triple the funds in the loan program will be needed to meet demand.
Besides Mnuchin saying he’ll ask Congress for more funding if necessary, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been discussing that concern with both Republican and Democratic members of Congress, who are aware of the issue and would address it, said Neil Bradley, the group’s chief policy officer.
“No one wants anyone to go out of -- a small business to go out of business because they were the next person in line when we reached the $350 billion,” Bradley said in a conference call with reporters."

As President Donald Trump’s initial tweet-heard-round-the-(oil)-world has snowballed into a seething mass of optimistic rumor, so the more — how to put this? — speculative stocks have floated to the top. Just as crude oil recorded a 25% gain Thursday by moving all of $5 a barrel, Whiting was near the top of the leaderboard on the back of a 4-cent rally.
Saudi Arabia’s call for an emergency Zoom session on Monday, along with reports that Russia may be coming around to the idea of supply cuts, lend credence to the idea that, even if Trump wildly jumped the gun, cuts are coming. Cue mass celebration in the oil market.
To which, one can only say this: Supply. Cuts. Were. Coming. Anyway. As I wrote here, the collapse in demand means we will quickly run out of places to stash surplus oil. Which means refiners stop buying (almost regardless of price) and production gets shut in (some is already). Saudi Arabia and Russia would love to get the U.S. to sign up as a willing partner in making this look like market management rather than managed retreat — and Trump may be of a similar mind.
Getting cuts of anywhere near the 10 million barrels (a day, we think) cut that Trump touted looks very unlikely given the time pressure. On Thursday, I quoted Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners as saying, “Tweets travel at the speed of light; barrels move at 10 knots.” To which we can add that the novel coronavirus moves at an exponential pace. Distancing measures mean demand in April could be down by 20 million or 30 million barrels a day. Hence, a cut of 10 million barrels a day would only extend the timeline for storage filling up and, in order to work, would have to happen very quickly.
The country best able to take production down quickly is, as ever, Saudi Arabia. And as painful as it might be to the country’s pride, reversing its stance of maximizing output, adopted less than a month ago, would make sense. Right now, the world has perhaps 700 million barrels of spare storage capacity for crude oil which, assuming 20 million barrels a day of excess supply, would fill in five weeks. As the tanks top out, oil prices would begin collapsing toward single digits well before that deadline.
An immediate cut of, say, 7 million barrels a day, with more than half of that by Saudi Arabia, would push that deadline to more like eight weeks. Think of this as the oil world’s equivalent of flattening the curve, but with the idea being that you try to stave off storage tanks being overwhelmed rather than ICU beds. Damage would still be unavoidable. But Saudi Arabia makes more revenue by exporting 6.5 million barrels a day at $20 apiece than it would 10.5 million at $10. The resulting drop in tanker rates might also support the front end of the Brent crude oil curve, which is where unhedged OPEC producers make their money.
Nice theory. But there’s no guarantee of such immediate cuts being agreed at all — remember that OPEC meeting all of four weeks ago? Best case is that oil producers somehow extend the deadline for storage capacity maxing out, hopefully getting to a point in late May where demand has bottomed out and the inventory glut is merely historic rather than apocalyptic. And even at $20-$30 Brent, many U.S. frackers are still underwater, especially as they’re producing lighter grades more suited for (unwanted) gasoline and suffer discounts to benchmark pricing the further inland they are.
Set against the current reality of cratered oil demand, a lot of things need to go right — and quickly — to justify a hopeful outcome for producers. Four cents actually sounds about right for this rally.

"April 5, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/05/this-is-what-was-so-unusual-about-us-navy-making-captain-brett-crozier-step-down/,The Washington Post,This is what was so unusual about the U.S. Navy making Captain Brett Crozier step down.,"On Thursday, the Navy relieved Capt. Brett Crozier, commander of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, after the San Francisco Chronicle obtained and published a letter he wrote asking his Navy superiors to evacuate and quarantine most of the sailors on board. Crozier’s letter came after covid-19 infections began to spread on the Roosevelt, with three cases on March 24 escalating to over 100 positive cases as of April 3.
The Roosevelt’s crew of nearly 5,000 gave Crozier a rousing send-off. Since being relieved of command, Crozier has been hailed as a hero by many, while the Navy has maintained his handling of the letter led to a loss of trust and confidence in his leadership.
Here are three things to know about this case.
1. Military commanders get removed, but this is an unusual situation
After the initial three sailors tested positive for coronavirus and were medically evacuated from the ship, Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly stated this demonstrated the U.S. ability to keep the Navy’s ships fully functional while dealing with the pandemic. But Capt. Crozier argued that this conservative approach endangered the health and lives of his crew and that the Navy should remove most sailors from the ship (leaving a skeleton crew to manage the reactor) and into quarantine while the ship was thoroughly cleaned. On March 28, Crozier wrote a letter to his superiors making his case, sending the letter over unclassified email and reportedly copying individuals not in his chain of command. The letter then appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday.
At first, both the Navy’s military chief Admiral Michael Gilday and civilian Acting Secretary Modly stressed Crozier would not face “any type of retaliation” for having written the letter to his chain of command. On Wednesday, the Navy began evacuating more sailors from the ship. Then, on Thursday, the news media reported the Navy would relieve Crozier of command after all.
It is normal for military commanders to be relieved of duty for losing the “trust and confidence” of their superiors. Civilian leaders have relieved commanders over public disputes before — as was the case in 2010 for the commanding general of the war in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal.
Here’s what’s unusual in this case: As military ethicist Pauline Shanks Kaurin has argued, members of the military are subject to multiple, sometimes competing, loyalties. Unlike most cases of poor judgment or policy disagreement, this case involves an officer who believed he had to choose between loyalty to his people and loyalty to the rules of his organization. The military leadership appears to be saying Crozier showed poor judgment in privileging his loyalty to his people over loyalty to the institution.
2. Health and military readiness are intertwined
Public statements by Navy leaders suggest they are attempting to strike a balance between managing the spread of covid-19 among sailors and keeping ships operating as normal.
But this framing suggests a false choice. Military readiness depends on the health of the force. All four branches of the U.S. armed services frequently state people are their most valuable asset, and two Army generals are being praised for their pro-active measures that appear to have kept their people safe.
Nevertheless, analysts suggest the armed forces struggle with an underlying culture of not admitting to shortfalls. As a result, commanding officers feel pressure to claim full readiness on paper — despite any concerns over the health, welfare and therefore the actual readiness of their people.
The Navy is no stranger to this problem. In 2017, independent analysis found the Navy systematically suppressed complaints about gaps in personnel and other challenges before two major collisions at sea. One of the findings of the report was that communication between ship commanders and Navy leadership had broken down.
3. The Crozier case exposes challenges in the Navy’s command structure
Modly’s April 2 Defense Department briefing suggests he lost trust and confidence in Crozier because he believed the captain exercised poor judgment in widely disseminating a letter that might cause panic or reveal specific weaknesses to adversaries.
In his official statement, Modly insisted his message isn’t that the Navy does not want to hear bad news — just that it needs to come through the proper channels. Of course, all militaries depend on respect for the chain of command to ensure proper communication, discipline and coordination.
But that message may be lost upon many. Both the public response and the response among Navy personnel has been largely negative. The House Armed Services Committee leadership released a joint statement criticizing Modly for the decision, and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper for taking a hands-off approach. A group of U.S. senators followed suit.
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden condemned the Navy leadership in a tweet. Retired rear admiral and former Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby called the firing “reckless and foolish.” And retired Adm. Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said relieving Crozier of command “was a really bad decision.”
President Trump, who had not commented during the week, broke his silence Saturday, saying Crozier’s letter was “not appropriate” and insinuating Crozier was responsible for exposing his sailors to the virus by making a stop in Vietnam — a stop that was pre-scheduled by the regional command in charge of the Pacific.
Also complicating the optics of the situation is the involvement of Modly himself. Last summer, Trump intervened in the Navy’s handling of a personnel action involving Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, ultimately resulting in the November 2019 removal of then-Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer and the installation of Modly as acting secretary. While no one disputed the president’s legal authority, many questioned the appropriateness of civilian political intervention into internal professional processes. Similarly, no one questions Modly’s legal authority to remove a commander in whom he has lost confidence. But the fact it was a political appointee associated with another highly politicized case who relieved Crozier, rather than a uniformed officer in the chain of command, may contribute to a perception that this is more about political embarrassment than a breach of security.
Command of a ship is an unforgiving job, but so is political leadership of the Navy. Crozier may be gone, but two major leadership scuffles within the past year suggest the Navy’s problems are not over."
"April 5, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-jobless-statistics-should-guide-congress-and-the-president-on-the-next-phase-of-recovery/2020/04/05/dadfaeec-75c0-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html,The Washington Post,The jobless statistics should guide Congress and the president on the next phase of recovery,"NEARLY 10 million people have applied for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks, a mind-boggling statistic that, stunning as it is, fails to adequately communicate the human tragedy it represents. A month ago in the United States, jobs were abundant, wages were rising, and labor markets were drawing in previously marginally attached workers. Now a wave of layoffs, heavily affecting low- and moderate-income wage-earners in retail stores, hotels and restaurants, is swamping those previously positive developments — and the individual hopes and dreams attached to them.
The new jobless statistics should guide Congress and the president as they consider how to craft what seems an inevitable next phase of their economic response to the coronavirus crisis on top of the recent $2.2 trillion Cares Act. The economy is experiencing a deep, sudden blow to hard-working but vulnerable people and businesses that employed them. Many of those firms are small companies, 24 percent of which may have already gone on temporary shutdown, according to a survey released Friday by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Among those small businesses that haven’t ceased operations yet, 40 percent consider it likely they will do so within the next two weeks, at least temporarily, according to the survey.
The situation calls for a correspondingly swift and strong response targeted at these areas of greatest need. One popular idea — a massive infrastructure plan — might be meritorious in theory but would take months or years to work through the economy, and the benefits would be difficult to target. More likely to be effective would be one or more additional rounds of cash assistance to households, possibly continuing until some public health or employment target had been reached, along with additional support to small business payrolls if and when the current $350 billion in Small Business Administration lending capability runs out. State and local governments may also need additional fiscal support, lest they, too, be forced to make undue budget cuts in education, public heath, water and other basic services upon which local economies depend.
Recognizing these realities, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Friday dialed back her previous advocacy of a major infrastructure push when Congress returns from its recess, scheduled to conclude on April 20. She had been joined in that by President Trump, but this was one time when bipartisan agreement did not connote optimal policy. Ms. Pelosi is now talking about the need to build on the priorities in the Cares Act rather than try to add new ones. For a country still in the early stages of an economic disaster, but one that still might be salvaged through well-timed and well-targeted federal intervention, this strikes us as a more realistic approach."

“We know for these businesses speed is of the essence,” the bank said in a statement. “We can move fastest with our nearly 1 million small-business borrowing clients. That is our near-term priority. As the administration has made clear, going to your current lending bank is the fastest route.”
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company had staff working overnight Thursday to prepare for expected high volumes of applications Friday. The initiative is part of the $2.2 trillion government stimulus package and is aimed at helping small businesses survive the devastating impact of the pandemic.
“We’re setting up shop and activating thousands of people to be able to take the applications,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in an interview Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. The bank has been heavily involved in talks with the White House and Treasury on the program, he said.
On Thursday, the Small Business Administration bumped up to 1% the interest rate lenders may charge small businesses after banks complained that the previous approved rate of 0.5% was below even their own cost of funds.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza released additional guidelines for the program just a few hours before it’s expected to become widely available Friday.
“This is a very important program,” Mnuchin said in a news conference Thursday. “Please bring your workers back to work if you’ve let them go.”"

“The idea is to defer the payment, defer the impact,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in an interview Friday on CNBC. “We’re working with our customers who need help, who are losing their jobs. We have to preserve their ability to have cash flow.”
The lender is also dealing with a deluge of requests for funds from the government’s small-business relief program. By Friday evening, it had received 85,000 applications requesting $22 billion.
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender earlier said it was prioritizing 1 million of its existing small-business borrowers because they had already been vetted and could receive funds most quickly, Moynihan said.
That approach sparked criticism, including from Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, who tweeted that the policy isn’t from the government but rather from Bank of America. “They should drop it,” he said.
The bank later said it would broaden its lending soon.
“In this first initial launch, we have focused on our full-relationship clients” comprised of current borrowers, Dean Athanasia, president of the bank’s consumer and small-business division, said in a memo to staff. “We are also highly focused on responding to the needs of our core small-business customers who do not currently have any borrowing relationship. We will expand our process soon and, in the meantime, are addressing these through an escalation process.”
President Donald Trump, meanwhile, tweeted Friday that a “great job” is being done by Bank of America and many community banks. “Small businesses appreciate your work!”
Some banks, including Wells Fargo & Co., said they weren’t ready as lenders across the country grappled with a lack of detailed guidelines from the government. JPMorgan Chase & Co. started taking applications Friday afternoon after warning clients Thursday night it was still awaiting guidance and may not be ready the following day.
Separately, Moynihan said in the CNBC interview that only 5% of Bank of America’s trading employees are working from the company’s offices."
"April 6, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/06/this-years-low-oil-prices-will-hurt-these-countries-most/,The Washington Post,This year’s low oil prices will hurt these countries the most,"Oil prices have fallen dramatically in 2020, with dire consequences for some countries. The twin shocks of the novel coronavirus and a Russian-Saudi price war drove Brent crude to a low of about $25 a barrel in late March. Since then, prices recovered somewhat on rumors of an OPEC-plus production deal, but the outlook for oil prices remains low. Even if producers cut back significantly, oil prices are unlikely to return to $70 a barrel, as they were in January.
For some countries, an extended period of low prices could be crippling. Many oil exporters depend on oil sales for government revenue and their current account balance. But the pain will go beyond the headline oil states of Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States.
Our research suggests that while most oil exporters now face an economic shortfall, it is the African oil exporters that are least capable of cushioning the economic shock. Figuring out which countries will suffer the most from low oil prices requires looking not only at the economics of oil production, but also the political consequences.
Here are three important questions:
1. Which oil fields are still profitable?
The first thing oil producers want to know when prices fall is which oil fields are still profitable. Profitability between oil fields varies a lot, depending on geology, local infrastructure and political risks.
Some fields, like those in Saudi Arabia, are profitable at a price as low as $10 per barrel; others, like U.S. shale producers, estimate a profit threshold of $40 per barrel.
Production costs consist of two basic components: the fixed cost associated with exploration and developing the oil field (e.g., building infrastructure) and the operational cost of actually pumping the oil.
In the short term, oil producers will keep pumping so long as they can cover their operational costs, even if they are losing money overall. In the longer term, if prices remain low, they will stop investing in developing oil fields.
As existing oil wells run dry, production will decline. Historically, that has created the conditions for the boom-and-bust cycle in the oil industry; low oil prices eventually reduce supply, so prices rise, creating investment in supply, until prices crash again.
2. How oil-dependent is the government budget?
The second factor that matters is an oil-exporting government’s budget. If the country is spending a lot on its public sector, it needs more revenue to balance the budget. That need for revenue implies the need for a higher oil price.
According to the International Monetary Fund, fiscal break-even prices vary considerably, from Russia at roughly $42 per barrel to Iran at roughly $195 per barrel. Saudi Arabia’s fiscal break-even point is $84, meaning that at any oil price lower than $83 per barrel, the country will run a fiscal deficit, unless it makes policy changes.
But governments also have ways to manage their budgets, including cutting expenditures or raising other revenue. So a low oil price does not necessarily imply a country will soon see a specific deficit amount. Instead, it means that oil-dependent governments will face hard choices, like unpopular spending cuts, raising taxes or borrowing.
Current budgets in Iran, Algeria and Saudi Arabia are all quite threatened by the current era of low prices.
3. Who has a financial cushion?
And there is a third factor to consider: the country’s financial reserves. All countries hold financial reserves of some form, whether it is gold or foreign currencies. They can use these reserves to cushion the economic pain of a sudden downturn, like an oil price shock.
This figure shows the per-capita financial reserves of each major oil producer, based on data from the IMF.
Which countries will have the means to withstand the oil price shocks of 2020? Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations, along with Norway, seem in the best shape.

These data on financial reserves suggest that sub-Saharan African countries have the least cushion from low oil prices. Other countries, like Saudi Arabia, might face as large a budget shortfall — but have larger financial reserves. They can withstand low prices for years without making tough economic decisions. Not so, in much of Africa, as well as Ecuador and East Timor.
Economic hardship sometimes means social unrest
So how will newly low prices shake out for the world’s oil-producing countries?
All else being equal, countries suffering economic hard times are more likely to experience riots, protests and political instability. Yet a sudden dose of economic hardship is only one of many factors that will matter for politics.
Research on political instability by Jack Goldstone, Jay Ulfelder and others suggests that political conditions matter as much or more than economic circumstances. Further research by Erica Chenoweth and Ulfelder highlights demographic conditions (like a youth bulge), the extent of civil liberties and political institutions as key factors shaping what happens next.
The fuel subsidies that many governments have long provided are likely to prove a crucial factor for social unrest. Low global oil prices might force oil-exporting regimes to raise domestic prices on gasoline or diesel — which are often heavily government-subsidized. This makes these fuels more expensive for everyday consumers, who might revolt. Precisely because of that risk of revolt, subsidy reform campaigns often fail, research shows.
There is a potential silver lining, however. Low oil prices might mean fewer conflicts between nations, over time. Researchers (including the two authors of this article) debate the links between oil resources and war.
Yet at least some research suggests that oil wealth can make countries with aggressive intentions more likely to act on those intentions. That kind of “petro-aggression” can lead oil-rich nations into more military conflicts than typical countries. In the long run, lower oil prices might reduce that kind of conflict."
"April 6, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/06/energy-companies-foreign-payments/,The Washington Post,"Oil and mining companies should disclose what they pay, the law says. Critics say the SEC is undermining it.","At a moment when the Trump administration is planning significant oil purchases to prop up domestic petroleum prices, and some industry players are asking Washington to impose tariffs or sanctions to keep out imports, the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to make it possible for oil and mining companies to mask their payments to governments at home and around the world.
A U.S. law passed in 2010 requires the disclosure of such payments — but it has never gone into effect.
Now, amid the economic collapse brought on by the coronavirus, and the clamor for help from Washington, the SEC is proposing rules under that law that would make such disclosures so general as to be of little value. The timing is a coincidence, but critics say the blow to transparency would be especially unfortunate right now.
The proposed rules “would represent a breathtaking retreat from the leadership position the U.S. has sought to play in advancing extractive transparency and combating corruption,” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), an author of the original legislation, wrote to the SEC. Nine other senators, all Democrats, signed his letter as well.
The U.S. law was a pioneering effort to force oil and mining companies to declare their payments to foreign governments, as a hedge against corruption and cronyism, and it served as a spur for subsequent laws in Canada, Norway and the European Union.
Neighbors of the prosperous Blanket gold mine in Zimbabwe got a taste of what such laws accomplish earlier this year. They found out that in 2018 the company that runs the mine, listed on the Toronto stock exchange, paid fees of $144,760 to the local rural district council, and that it had paid almost as much the year before that, all according to figures gleaned in faraway Ottawa.
No one recalled anybody from the operating company, Caledonia Mining, or on the Gwanda Rural District Council ever saying anything about that. But in January, Mukasiri Sibanda, an attorney with the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association, arranged sessions with residents of the district, bearing with him the Canadian reports.
In a country noted for its lack of transparency, members of the community “think there is no accountability and the money is not being spent for the purpose of development,” Sibanda said in a telephone interview.
“I do not know about that money you are talking about,” said the head of the district council, Ronny Sibanda (no relation to Mukasiri), when asked about Caledonia’s payments.
What is happening in Gwanda is precisely what the framers of Canada’s Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act had in mind when they drew it up. Disclosure by oil and mining companies of payments made to government bodies, project by project, could both inform local populations of money coming into their communities and act as a check on corruption. Because Caledonia is listed on the Toronto stock exchange, it is required to report such payments worldwide.
“In countries like Zimbabwe, where oil and gas are quite opaque and transparency is quite low, this definitely changes the game,” said Emily Nickerson, the director of the Canadian branch of an organization called Publish What You Pay, who traveled through the Gwanda district with Sibanda earlier this year.
The Canadian law, which went into effect in 2015, and the similar European laws are directly modeled on the U.S. legislation, a section of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. “It was definitely the U.S. that acted first and that gave confidence to Canada and the E.U. to move,” Nickerson said.
And they’ve left the United States behind.
The Canadian and E.U. laws cover payments made anywhere in the world, so that it’s possible, for instance, to learn that the Chinese oil giant CNOOC paid $74 million in fees, royalties and taxes to various U.S. jurisdictions in 2018 — because CNOOC is listed on the London stock exchange. But Exxon and Chevron, listed in New York? No.
Twice, the SEC drew up rules to give substance to the law. In 2013, after the American Petroleum Institute sued, the courts struck down the first effort. The second attempt was repealed by the new Republican Congress in 2017, following vigorous lobbying by Rex Tillerson, the Exxon CEO who had just been nominated as secretary of state.
Now, there’s a third proposal, and the public comments have not been kind. The SEC commissioners themselves have been vividly at odds.
The proposed rule would require companies to report payments country by country, rather than for each contract, as earlier versions had required. Payments of less than $150,000 would no longer need to be itemized. In the Blanket mine example, if this rule had applied, Caledonia could have reported one sum for all of Zimbabwe, without specific mention of the fees it pays to the Gwanda Rural District Council. Another provision in the proposal would screen the company reports to the SEC from public scrutiny.
Hester M. Peirce, one of three commissioners to support the new rule, sharply criticized the use of securities legislation to accomplish the goals of “civil society” groups. Doing so “would hamper our ability to serve investors, dampen issuers’ interest in raising money in our public markets, and erode our position as home to the most vibrant and liquid capital markets in the world,” she said.
“It’s a terrible rule,” said Isabel Munilla of Oxfam, which has been pushing for corporate transparency. Citing the Canadian and European laws, she said, “This approach of the SEC is fundamentally and embarrassingly out of step.”
Reporting on a project-by-project basis, as the earlier versions required, is important because that is the level where corruption occurs, said Zorka Milin, a lawyer with a transparency group called Global Witness.
“There are industry fingerprints all over this new rule,” said Kathleen Brophy of Publish What You Pay’s Washington office.
The legislation, an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act called Section 1504, was sponsored by Cardin and then-Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R.-Ind.). “The point of the law was to give transparency to these contracts, and to give the local communities the means to hold their governments accountable,” said Algene Sajery, an aide to Cardin. “This is a really weak rule, a really sad day. It does not reflect congressional intent.”
Foreign oil majors have also been critical.
“In the 21st century, we have to be transparent,” said Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, the French company, during a visit to Washington. “In Europe, we’re disclosing everything. We are hiding nothing. I don’t see why our U.S. colleagues should oppose it.”
A stronger rule, he acknowledged, would put European- and U.S.-listed companies on the same footing as they seek opportunities around the world, which he naturally supports.
“But transparency obliges people to be more responsible,” he said.
BP has also found fault with the proposed rules.
The Mining Association of Canada supports the law there. Its member companies, said Ben Chalmers, the association director, “were paying a reasonable amount of taxes,” and they decided it was in their own interest to keep the public informed. “These conversations” about what companies were paying, he said, “have been happening anyway. We thought it would be better to have these conversations with facts.”
Michelle Harrison of EarthRights International, an advocacy group, said she believes some U.S. energy companies are opposed to the rule because it would reveal just how low their U.S. taxes are.
When Congress revoked the second version of the Cardin-Lugar rule, in 2017, it used its authority under the Congressional Review Act. That law requires the appropriate agency to draw up a new version of a rule that cannot be “substantially the same” as the one rejected by Congress. But no one has defined what that means.
Allison Herren Lee, an SEC commissioner appointed by President Trump, argued that the new rule strays too far. It “essentially reverses the 2016 final rule in almost every significant respect,” she said.
It doesn’t matter, she said, if some of her colleagues believe the SEC should not be promulgating anti-corruption rules. The law is the law, she said, and the proposed rule undercuts its goals.
Another commissioner, Robert J. Jackson, Jr., argued that the new rule hurts investors, who benefit from transparency. It would “make it harder to hold corporate insiders to account for the choices they make,” he said.
Commissioner Elad L. Roisman disagrees. “This was not a typical rulemaking,” he said. “To begin with, this has no pretense of furthering the SEC’s tripartite mission: protect investors; maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. Not one of us can pretend that it does so.”
He suggested that the SEC is the wrong body to carry out the task.
The American Petroleum Institute, which went to court to get the first rule knocked down and applauded the repeal of the second rule, supports much of what is in the third.
“The industry has historically supported transparency efforts and many of our member companies are filing revenue transparency reports under the rules of other jurisdictions,” the API’s vice president of corporate policy, Stephen Comstock, said in a statement. “We have always felt that successful implementation of the Dodd-Frank legislation depends on rules that manage the need for revenue data with the concerns with disclosures that could create competitive harms and undermine development.”
Companies report their own numbers in Europe and Canada, and advocates of the disclosure laws acknowledge that there could be some fudging. But they argue that it’s at least a step in the right direction.
CNOOC reported payments to governments in 18 countries, including the United States, in 2018: from $294,000 to Equatorial Guinea to $3.3 billion to its own government in Beijing. Gazprom reported payments of $21.4 billion to the Russian government. And $32,000 to Kyrgyzstan.
Besides Caledonia, two other companies reported making payments to Zimbabwe governments, altogether totaling $11 million.
A voluntary effort, called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, has signed up 52 participating countries to publish reports on a national level, though particulars vary from country to country.
The EITI is good as far as it goes, said Peter Jones, a U.K.-based investigator with Global Witness. But “it’s not hard law.” It works best as a complement to legislation, he said.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said he believes the new rule is “true to the requirements” of the law, but he has suggested the commission could take some of the criticisms into account as it drafts a final version."

There are different pots of money for different kinds of companies. Banks on Friday began accepting applications for the $350 billion available for small and medium companies under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, established as part of the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package.
The Treasury and the Federal Reserve are still working on how to deploy more than $500 billion to purchase corporate and local government securities and provide aid for airlines, as well as companies like Boeing deemed essential for national security.
So how do you access the cash? Here’s a guide for some of the benefits that are available and how to qualify:
Small Businesses
• Benefit: SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program. Up to $10 million per small business or nonprofit organization. Almost $350 billion will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Business can get a loan at 1% interest to cover up to 250% of average monthly payroll costs -- including group health insurance premiums, retirement contributions and state and local payroll taxes, even cash tips that the employer recorded. The loan will be forgiven for businesses that retain or rehire workers to restore their Feb. 15 headcount. If a company lays off workers or reduces payroll expenses, the loan forgiveness will be reduced or eliminated.
Who is eligible: Companies with fewer than 500 employees or otherwise meet the SBA’s definition of a small business, small nonprofits including religious organizations and even self-employed people who certify that the loan request is necessary to support ongoing operations given the pandemic’s economic uncertainty. Small businesses in the hospitality and food industry with more than one location can also be eligible if their individual locations employ less than 500 workers.
How to get it: Apply through a participating bank or lender. A sample two-page application form is available from the SBA website. Be sure to have appropriate documents showing payroll records for the entire previous year and payroll costs for the period including Feb. 15. Also bring records showing the business’s utility costs and rent or mortgage interest costs. If the company doesn’t have an existing relationship with the lender, be prepared to satisfy Bank Secrecy Act requirements to prove the business is legitimate and show the identities of those with a beneficial interest.
Special limitation: The money is capped at an annualized payroll rate of $100,000 per worker.
Bottom line: Get in line fast for this first-come, first-serve program. This is a no-brainer if you qualify, and tens of millions of businesses and nonprofits could be swamping bank offices in the coming weeks. The deadline for getting the loan is June 30, or until money runs out.
Airlines and Related Companies
• Benefit: Up to $32 billion in payroll grants for airlines, contractors and cargo carriers, controlled by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Who is eligible: Airlines, contractors like catering companies, and air cargo haulers can get a combined $32 billion in grants to pay their workers.
How to get it: Companies need to continue flying routes required by the government and keep their employees on payrolls through Sept. 30. Outside firms are advising Mnuchin on the terms he should set, including what he will demand from airlines in return, such as warrants for equity in the companies. Mnuchin has said the money should be more than a bailout. He has solicited proposals from the airlines for terms on receiving the aid and has issued guidance.
• Benefit: Airlines and cargo carriers can also apply for loans from a $29 billion pot.
Who is eligible: The same airlines and cargo companies eligible for the grants also have the option to apply for these loans.
How to get it: Companies also need to go through Treasury to get these loans.
National Security Companies
• Benefit: Up to $17 billion in loans for companies deemed crucial for national security.
Who is eligible: Boeing, with its aircraft manufacturing and broad supply chain, will be one of the clearest beneficiaries, although the law doesn’t specifically mention the company.
How to get it: The companies also need to go through Treasury to get these loans.
Corporations and Local Governments
• Benefit: The Federal Reserve has access to at least $454 billion it can use to leverage trillions of dollars in facilities intended to back up companies as well as state and local governments.
Who is eligible: This will be up to the Federal Reserve.
How to get it: The Federal Reserve facilities are still evolving. Mnuchin said lots of companies will be able to participate through broad facilities for both larger companies like energy firms and Main Street businesses.
Special limitations: The law includes restrictions on executive pay and stock buybacks for firms that access this aid. Congress set up a series of oversight mechanisms to review how all of that cash gets spent, including a special inspector general, an accountability committee of relevant government departments and an oversight panel.
Other Perks Available: Tax Cuts and Deferrals
• Benefit: Turn business losses into cash refunds
Who is eligible: Any company that lost money in 2018, 2019 or 2020 but turned a profit in the past five years.
How to get it: If a firm can show losses from 2018 or 2019, it can go back five years to offset past profits and ask the IRS for a refund now. The IRS has not yet issued guidance about how to claim those refunds, but in the past the IRS has reimbursed companies within 45 days. If a business has losses this year, it can take the losses at the beginning of next year.
• Benefit: Tax Payment Delay
Who is eligible: Companies of all sizes and individuals can delay filing their 2019 tax returns, paying any outstanding tax liability and submitting estimated taxes for the first quarter of 2020 until July 15.
How to get it: No action is needed for the extended due date for income taxes. The IRS also allows companies to delay filing their taxes until October 15, but that requires a form requesting an extension with the agency. Tax bills that aren’t paid by July 15 will start accruing interest and penalties, even for companies approved to file the return in October.
• Benefit: Payroll Tax Deferral
Who is eligible: Corporations can also put off paying the employer-side payroll taxes they owe for up to two years. One exception: companies that get their Payroll Protection Program loans forgiven can’t defer their payroll taxes.
How to get it: Companies can defer paying all of the 6.2% payroll levies they owe the government for the rest of 2020 and can spread those payments out over 2021 and 2022. At least half must be submitted by the end of 2021.
• Benefit: Employee retention tax credit
Who is eligible: Companies of all sizes and non-profits forced to close or slow business could be eligible for a refundable tax credit if they keep workers on the job. Firms that get Payroll Protection Program loans can’t claim this tax break either. Companies with more than 100 employees can only claim the tax credit against wages paid to employees with work curtailed by the pandemic.
How to get it: Employers can get up to $5,000 per worker they keep on the job during the downturn. The credit is applied against payroll taxes, submitted quarterly, but companies can also ask for an advance using these instructions and form from the IRS. The tax break is refundable, meaning businesses can get a check back from the IRS if companies have amassed credits larger than their payroll tax bills.
• Benefit: Tax credit for paid sick and family leave
Who is eligible: Employers with fewer than 500 employees can receive dollar-for-dollar tax credits that reimburse them for providing paid sick and family leave wages for workers who have to take leave related to the virus. Self-employed individuals are also able to claim a similar credit. One important caveat: Paid sick and family leave reimbursed by the tax credit is excluded from the payroll costs that can be claimed as part of the Payroll Protection Program.
How to get it: Employers that offer workers up to 80 hours of paid sick leave and up to an additional 10 weeks to care for a child due to school closures can claim the credit for wages paid starting April 1. Companies can claim the tax breaks on their quarterly federal employment tax returns, but they can benefit more quickly from the credits by reducing their employment tax deposits. If the credit amount is larger than the federal employment taxes, companies can request an advance payment of the credits from the IRS."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-one-word-that-explains-why-trump-should-not-be-president/2020/04/06/0ae070cc-7828-11ea-b6ff-597f170df8f8_story.html,The Washington Post,The one word that explains why Trump should not be president,"“What do I know? I’m not a doctor.”
It’s rare that President Trump speaks with even that level of clarity. Unfortunately, this observation came Sunday amid an avalanche of nonsense about the anti-malaria drug that he believes to be a magic bullet against covid-19. It is remarkable how a tongue-twisting word few of us were familiar with a month ago — hydroxychloroquine — has suddenly come to represent so many of the reasons Trump should not be president, especially during a time of crisis.
That one word illustrates Trump’s arbitrary, anecdote-based method of making decisions; his reliance on cronies who have no relevant expertise; his rejection of science, or perhaps his failure to understand how science even works; his defiant stubbornness in clinging to what he “knows,” even when he doesn’t actually know it; his obsessiveness even in the face of contrary evidence; and his imperviousness to fact-based arguments he does not want to hear.
Not for the first time, and probably not for the last, Trump spent a good part of Sunday’s covid-19 briefing touting the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covid-19. Why is he so convinced? Because “they say” it works.
Who are “they” who make such a claim? Certainly not the expert scientists who are supposed to be leading the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said repeatedly that evidence of hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness is at best anecdotal. 
Instead of heeding Fauci’s caution, Trump has reportedly been listening to his personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who told The Post in an interview that he has advocated the use of the drug “three or four times” in phone calls with the president. “I discussed it with the president after he talked about it,” Giuliani said. “I told him what I had on the drugs.”
Another advocate for hydroxychloroquine is Peter Navarro, Trump’s friend and economic adviser, who reportedly got into a shouting match with Fauci about the drug at a White House meeting on Saturday. Navarro — an economist, not a medical doctor — told CNN he was qualified to assess the drug’s effectiveness because “I’m a social scientist. . . . I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it's in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.”
There are, indeed, small preliminary studies conducted in China and France showing, according to their authors, that hydroxychloroquine is of some benefit to patients suffering from covid-19. I am no more qualified than Navarro or Giuliani to evaluate those studies. But Fauci has pointed out that the study in France involved just 20 patients with no control group, and that six other patients who were originally part of the study cohort were dropped and excluded from the results, including three who had to be put in intensive care and one who died.
If I had a loved one who was hospitalized and desperately ill with covid-19, I would want doctors to try everything, including hydroxychloroquine, that might conceivably help. But Trump has dangerously suggested that the drug be taken prophylactically by healthy people to guard against the disease. Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat some autoimmune conditions, and Trump has cited anecdotal reports from a handful of doctors that their patients who suffer from lupus seem to have some resistance to covid-19. “I may take it,” Trump said Saturday.
Last month, an Arizona man died after ingesting a non-pharmaceutical form of a related drug — chloroquine phosphate — used to clean aquarium tanks. No, Trump never told anyone to swallow aquarium cleaner. But the man’s wife, who also took the substance but survived, told NBC News that she heard about hydroxychloroquine from Trump’s briefings and “I saw it sitting on the back shelf and thought, ‘Hey, isn't that the stuff they're talking about on TV?’ ”
The upshot is that the federal government, spurred by Trump’s obsession, has spent time and money amassing a massive stockpile of a drug that may or may not be of value against covid-19, though it definitely helps patients with a range of other conditions who now are having trouble obtaining it. 
I hope it turns out that hydroxychloroquine actually works. I hope Trump’s instinct about this drug is better than his original instinct that covid-19 was no worse than the seasonal flu. Hope, however, is not part of the scientific method.
Reporters tried to ask Fauci again about hydroxychloroquine Sunday, but Trump would not let him answer. We have a president, unfortunately, who is often wrong — but never in doubt."
April 7. 2020,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/next-stimulus-to-be-at-least-1-trillion-pelosi-tells-democrats/2020/04/06/9f1e61e2-784e-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,Pelosi Says Next Stimulus Round Will Be $1 Trillion or More,"Congress‘s next stimulus bill to prop up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus crisis will be at least another $1 trillion, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats on a private conference call.
The next stimulus package would be focused on replenishing funds for programs established in Congress’s $2.2 trillion virus relief bill signed into law last month, according to people on the call. Pelosi said there should be additional direct payments to individuals, extended unemployment insurance, more resources for food stamps and more funds for the Payroll Protection Plan that provides loans to small businesses, lawmakers on the call said.
Pelosi also said the bill should assist state and local governments, with an emphasis on smaller municipalities with fewer than 500,000 residents, one lawmaker said.
Pelosi has said she wants the next stimulus bill to be passed this month. The House isn’t scheduled to be back in session until April 20 at the earliest. It is possible to pass legislation with most members out of town, as long as no one objects.
Several lawmakers predicted the final price tag would be much larger.
President Donald Trump said Saturday he’ll ask Congress for more money for small business loans if the $349 billion already designated for the program runs out.
In a White House briefing on Monday, Trump also said that if another round of stimulus is needed, he would consider more direct payments to Americans. It’s “absolutely under serious consideration,” he said, adding he also wants “real infrastructure” as a part of it.
Yellen’s Advice
Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen also participated in the call and told House Democrats that banks are worried about being held accountable for fraud in a program aiming to get money out the door quickly. She said Congress should provide safe-harbor protections to make sure banks aren’t held responsible for abuses that aren’t their fault, according to one of the people on the call.
Yellen also repeated her earlier predictions about the gravity of the economic crisis as much of the country avoids travel and entertainment to contain the virus. She said the unemployment rate is probably at least 13% already, adding that how long and deep the recession is will depend on the public health response.
In response to a question from Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford about the best way for states to respond, Yellen said there will be tremendous need for additional funds to support local governments, according to people on the call. She suggested that the Federal Housing Finance Agency could get involved to help head off a foreclosure crisis, the people said.
Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan said he supports calls by some Democrats to allow the Federal Reserve to buy up municipal debt, although many local governments can’t borrow to cover current costs and revenue shortfalls because of balanced-budget requirements. Speaking in an interview after the call, Kildee said getting Republicans to agree to help states and localities will be “very tough.”
”I don’t know how sustainable bipartisanship is as we move into recovery,” Kildee said, adding that the primary goal is still to mitigate the economic crisis. More ambitious recovery efforts, involving infrastructure spending, for example, will have to wait.
Kildee said he spoke on the call to say Congress should extend the small-business loan program for five months, from the current deadline of June 30. He said even if the current funding doesn’t run out, “overshooting” would help reduce the fear currently driving the recession deeper."

Don’t ask this administration.,"DEPENDING ON who is speaking at the highest levels of the U.S. government, the coming days will be like Pearl Harbor or a “light at the end of the tunnel.” A cloth face mask is a good idea, recommended by experts especially in closed areas with people nearby, or it is entirely voluntary and not fit for a president. The anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is exhibiting “very strong, powerful signs” of fighting the virus, or the case for it rests on anecdotal and unproven evidence.
These are the mixed messages from President Trump and his administration. At a time when public cooperation is desperately needed to blunt the disease, clarity is essential — and essentially missing.
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has scaled back its projection of the stress on hospital beds, relying on new data showing that social distancing is working. The curve is flattening, a glimmer of hope. But the signals coming out of the White House over the weekend could give anyone whiplash. The next week “is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment,” declared Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general. “It’s going to be our 9/11 moment.” The president insisted, “We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, “We are struggling to get it under control.” Clear?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance telling people to wear cloth face coverings where it is difficult to socially distance, such as at the grocery store. The guidance was triggered by scientific reports that infected people who don’t yet show symptoms can nonetheless transmit the virus. The Pentagon instructed military personnel to wear cloth face coverings when they can’t socially distance. But not Mr. Trump. “Somehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk — the great Resolute Desk — I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know,” he said. “Somehow I don’t see it for myself. I just don’t.”
The news outlet Axios carried a dramatic account of a confrontation in the White House Situation Room between the president’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, who was advocating more use of hydroxychloroquine, and Dr. Fauci, who has been skeptical — and has expertise in this field. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s unpaid adviser, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has been touting the drug to Mr. Trump and in public. “What do you have to lose? Take it,” Mr. Trump said at a White House briefing, allowing that it was a decision for patients and doctors. “Try it, if you’d like.” Then Mr. Trump blocked Dr. Fauci from answering a question about it. The handling of the whole matter is reckless; claims for the drug are unproven, and by generating demand, the president robs those who need it for other illnesses.
The reason for the confusion is no mystery: Mr. Trump will not consistently defer to experts, and his officials fear crossing him. After Dr. Adams, the surgeon general, proclaimed our imminent Pearl Harbor, Fox News’s Chris Wallace asked him whether it then didn’t behoove all governors to order people to shelter in place. Dr. Adams, no doubt mindful of the president’s gyrations on this, couldn’t bring himself to deliver the obvious answer. Instead, he responded with an absurd, irrelevant evasion: “More people will die, even in the worst projections, from cigarette smoking in this country than are going to die from coronavirus this year,” he said.
That is no way to defeat a pandemic."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-is-trumps-vilest-act-of-retribution-yet/2020/04/06/c685cb0a-781f-11ea-b6ff-597f170df8f8_story.html,The Washington Post,This is Trump’s vilest act of retribution yet,"WHEN MICHAEL ATKINSON, the intelligence community’s inspector general, received a whistleblower’s complaint on Aug. 12 about President Trump’s attempt to extort political favors from Ukraine, he judged that it was “credible” and of “urgent concern.” As sworn congressional testimony later conclusively confirmed, he was right. Federal law required that in those circumstances, the whistleblower report be delivered to Congress; in a Aug. 26 letter to the acting director of national intelligence, Mr. Atkinson said the legal standard had been met.
For that, Mr. Atkinson, a respected, nonpartisan public servant with a 17-year record, was fired late Friday night by Mr. Trump, who used the cover of night and the novel coronavirus pandemic to extend his purge of officials who cooperated with the exposure or investigation of his wrongdoing. It was the most blatant and shameful act of retribution yet by a president who has sought to shut down all independent checks on his behavior.
Unlike Joseph Maguire, the acting intelligence director whom Mr. Trump previously fired, or Gordon Sondland, the dismissed ambassador to the European Union, or Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the ousted National Security Council director for Ukraine, Mr. Atkinson’s job was not to implement Trump administration policies. Rather, like inspectors general across the government, his job, as he put it in a statement he released Sunday, was to act “as an independent and impartial” auditor. “It is hard not to think that the president’s loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations,” Mr. Atkinson wrote.
Mr. Trump, whose autocratic impulses have been swelled by the abject failure of Congress to check them, did not pretend otherwise. “He did a terrible job,” he told reporters Saturday. “He took a fake report and brought it to Congress with an emergency, Okay? Not a big Trump fan, I can tell you.” He further complained that Mr. Atkinson “never came in to see me” before forwarding the whistleblower complaint.
The disregard for truth and the rule of law laced through that rant is breathtaking. First, as a number of Republican senators subsequently acknowledged, the complaint that Mr. Atkinson forwarded was not fake but an accurate description of the pressure Mr. Trump placed on Ukraine’s president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. Contrary to the president’s suggestion, Mr. Atkinson’s duty was not to consult him about the whistleblower complaint — much less to be a “Trump fan” — but to determine whether the allegation was credible and, if so, forward it to Congress while protecting the whistleblower.
Mr. Atkinson did that, scrupulously. His reward was to have his career upended by a president who regards the U.S. government as his personal satrapy. Once again, congressional Republicans are unwilling to check Mr. Trump’s abuse; apart from a meek request from Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) for “written reasons” for Mr. Atkinson’s removal, they have been silent.
In his statement, Mr. Atkinson himself appealed to government employees and contractors to speak up when they observe “unethical, wasteful, or illegal behavior. . . . Please do not allow recent events to silence your voices.” We trust there will be more whistleblowers, but thanks to this president’s wanton political purges and the failure of Congress to resist them, doing their duty will take more courage than should be required of any public servant."

It’s hardly the first time these two giant producers have tried to reap economic and geopolitical advantage by manipulating the output of their state-owned wells. Nor is it new that the United States figures in the drama as an interested third party.
What’s a bit different, however, is who in the United States stands to win — or lose — depending on how the Saudi-Russian struggle comes out.
Decades ago, U.S. dependence on oil imports meant Americans mostly felt the impact from higher world oil prices as they were passed on to consumers at the gas pump.
Now, however, the United States is the world’s largest producer, thanks to the shale oil revolution (a.k.a. fracking). The country has acquired more influence over global oil and gas markets, and large groups have a stake in higher prices: independent oil producers, hundreds of thousands of oil workers, banks and states that rely on oil industry taxes.
Accordingly, President Trump has spoken out of both sides of his mouth about the Saudi-Russian oil price war. On March 9, he tweeted: “Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!” On Thursday, he tweeted his “hope” that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, would agree on production cuts, which “will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!”
Trump’s outbursts are anything but presidential, but even a more circumspect, strategic Oval Office occupant would face a dilemma.
Is there any way out? The triangular U.S.-Saudi-Russian relationship has been shaping geopolitics and economics for almost half a century. In 1973, the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) crippled the U.S. economy by stopping oil exports in retaliation for U.S. backing of Israel’s war with Arab states.
The 1979 Iranian Revolution and subsequent Iran-Iraq war imposed another sudden cut in supply, and hike in prices, which the then-Soviet Union exploited by ramping up its production and exports.
Western countries’ countermeasures — conservation, especially — curbed demand and moderated prices. Yet in the late 1980s, Saudi Arabia pumped oil in generous quantities, mostly because of internal OPEC politics; the United States was happy because this also punished the Soviets as they were occupying Muslim Afghanistan. The resulting loss of income helped speed the U.S.S.R.’s collapse.
Today’s situation, ironically, has come about in part because of what all three countries have done since to protect themselves from a repetition of history.
Seeking “energy independence,” the United States gave relatively free rein to domestic producers and, under President Barack Obama, legalized crude oil exports for the first time since the 1970s. Putin improved the efficiency of Russia’s industry and used oil revenue to fill up a $570 billion reserve fund — about a third of gross domestic product. Under MBS, the Saudis have also amassed a sovereign wealth fund and reduced their debt-to-GDP ratio to just 25 percent.
Oil-market experts believe Russia and Saudi Arabia can probably pay their bills with a price per barrel at or near $30; meanwhile, a March survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that U.S. companies could survive at prices between $27 and $37, near where they were on Monday.
This is no doubt why Putin felt he could refuse MBS’s pleas to cut production in early March. He likely thought additional supply would hurt him less than it would hurt U.S. producers — payback for U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia because of its misconduct in Crimea, Venezuela and elsewhere.
And it is apparently why MBS felt he both could and must retaliate against Putin by surging production when Putin snubbed him.
All of that happened before these dictators quite realized the full economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, and even then the oil market was already soft.
Now, storage facilities are overflowing and per-barrel prices could be heading for the low teens.
Lobbied by the oil industry, Trump appears tempted to broker a Saudi-Russian deal that U.S. producers can live with.
Down that road lies OPEC 2.0, with the United States and two sordid dictatorships determining the price industrialized democracies pay for energy.
The green alternative — ban fracking and move immediately to a non-fossil-fuel future — would leave everyone, the United States included, at the mercy of the Saudis and Russians.
Probably the most sustainable option, once the current crisis passes, would be an aggressive return to the strategy that tamed OPEC in the early ’80s — conservation — via gas taxes and other forms of carbon pricing.
As both the biggest producer of crude oil and the biggest consumer, the United States has a conflicted national interest. The one thing we can’t allow is for the likes of MBS and Putin to exploit it."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bernie-sanderss-supporters-take-sides-over-whether-he-should-stay-in-the-race-or-consider-departing/2020/04/06/3c71be1c-7813-11ea-9bee-c5bf9d2e3288_story.html,The Washington Post,Bernie Sanders’s supporters take sides over whether he should stay in the race or consider departing,"Sen. Bernie Sanders’s lengthy deliberations about the future of his presidential campaign have exposed divisions in his movement between die-hard liberal activists with little appetite to fall in line behind former vice president Joe Biden and more conventional Democrats who see some merit in Sanders (I-Vt.) withdrawing from the race.
After revelations that some top aides and allies have urged the senator to consider ending his campaign, some Sanders supporters voiced alarm about the people surrounding him and have even called for their ouster.
The Washington Post reported Saturday that the group lobbying him to consider withdrawing included campaign manager Faiz Shakir and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a top Sanders surrogate and ally, according to the two people with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive private discussions.
“They shouldn’t be part of the campaign,” said RoseAnn DeMoro in an interview Monday, speaking of anyone encouraging him to consider bowing out. A longtime friend of Sanders and a former head of a national nurses’ union, DeMoro added, “If people want to go work on K Street right now, go. The base is attached to the movement and Bernie, not operatives.”
Sanders, who has fallen far behind Biden in the chase for delegates to the summer nominating convention with almost no realistic path to catching him, has not declared his intentions beyond saying he is assessing his path forward.
He has been sounding out many top supporters in recent weeks. Shortly before she participated in a virtual roundtable with Sanders on March 22, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) advised him in a telephone call to remain in the contest, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has campaigned for Sanders, has talked openly about the need for Democrats to unite behind a possible Biden nomination. After Sanders’s losses on Super Tuesday, she said that the election was “more important than all of us.”
Still, her team and the Sanders camp remain in contact — Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign manager Rebecca Rodriguez spoke to Shakir on Sunday, according to a spokesperson.
The uncertainty has created some tension in the universe of Sanders supporters, which includes legions of everyday people who have donated to his campaign, lawmakers who have endorsed him and activists and advisers he has consulted.
“If I was told who the nominee was going to be, but I didn’t get to vote, I would feel disenfranchised,” said Randy Bryce, a Sanders state co-chair and former congressional candidate who wants him to keep running at least through the last primaries in June. “People will feel like they’re not going to matter in one of those later states if there’s not a primary.”
Bryce’s home state of Wisconsin was set on Tuesday to be the first state in three weeks to hold a primary. But it was cast into doubt Monday when Gov. Tony Evers (D) suspended in-person voting; later in the day the state Supreme Court overturned his action after a legal challenge from the state’s GOP legislative leaders.
Some close Sanders allies had said the outcome in Wisconsin could offer more clarity about the senator’s future. They predicted that a landslide loss, as recent polling has predicted, might persuade him to end his bid. Evers’s executive order would have extended the mail-in voting deadline to June 9.
On Monday, Our Revolution, a nonprofit aligned with Sanders, sent an email to supporters with the subject line “Tell Bernie if you’ll have his back if he stays in the presidential race.”
“If Bernie remains in the race, he will undoubtedly be over the 25% threshold necessary to get enough members on the Rules and Platform Committees who can fight for our vision of a progressive party,” said the email, which was signed by Larry Cohen, board chairman of Our Revolution.
The rules changes that Sanders allies fought for after the 2016 race, including one that prevents automatic “superdelegates” from voting on the first ballot of the convention, would expire unless agreed to by the key committees this year.
“Things like that would be at risk if the senator doesn’t hit 15 percent in the remaining primaries,” said Paco Fabian, a spokesman for Our Revolution. “We have very little confidence, if not zero, that the rules implemented last time would remain in place. We need to make sure they’re made permanent.”
Beyond Shakir and Jayapal, longtime strategist Jeff Weaver has privately made a case that exiting the race more quickly and on good terms with Biden would give Sanders added leverage in the long run, according to one of the people who described the discussions; the other said Weaver has used a light touch in presenting his case.
Early Sunday morning, after The Post reported those internal deliberations, “People for Bernie,” a group of pro-Sanders activists, tweeted, “Bernie Sanders should not drop out. Pass it on.”
Those close to Sanders say he is focused heavily on the coronavirus crisis and they are not certain what he will decide. Over the past few weeks, he has used his campaign as a vehicle to champion the liberal ideas he believes the government should adopt to combat the crisis, such as universal health care coverage.
Gone are the raucous rallies that have been deemed unsafe during the spread of the virus. Instead, he has hosted events with experts, musical guests and political allies, streamed live on the Internet.
Sanders has ceased his direct attacks on Biden, even as some allies, including DeMoro and Bryce, have not. The senator said recently that he would like to debate Biden again, while Biden has argued that there have been enough debates. A Democratic National Committee spokeswoman said Monday that she had no new updates on whether there would be another primary debate.
The two men talked recently when Biden called Sanders to inform him, as a courtesy, that he would soon be beginning the process to pick a running mate.
With the Senate out of session and much of the country hunkering down, Sanders has been at home in Vermont. A pair of aides — one who handles logistics and another responsible for video live streams — have been with him, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, but senior staff are working from their homes.
On Sunday, at least one staffer was making a public push for a prolonged primary fight.
“Four out of five of the largest Black populations in the country haven’t voted. And some of you want to call off the primary. Your interest in the franchise is self interest, and it shows,” tweeted Briahna Joy Gray, national press secretary for the Sanders campaign."

Banking representatives and an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the E-Tran system that lenders use to process loans under a new relief program that launched on Friday was inaccessible for part of the day on Monday. The administration official said it was offline for as long as four hours.
An SBA official said later that the system was up and running and said it’s not accurate that the system crashed, without elaborating.
SBA continues to process, approve and guarantee billions of dollars in loans per hour and continues to add lenders to the system, the official said.
Jim Engel, Chief Executive and president of Aquesta Bank in Cornelius, North Carolina, said he was notified about 1 p.m. New York time that E-Tran was down for a few hours. “The system is just inundated with users,” he said. A spokeswoman for Celtic Bank said the system was down in the morning and is now back up.
The system troubles follows the rocky launch of the $349 billion Payroll Protection Program with loans meant to help small businesses pay workers and expenses as part of the $2 trillion stimulus package. Despite President Donald Trump saying on Saturday the roll-out has been “flawless,” there were widespread reports of problems and confusion, including lenders unable to access the E-Tran system.
The president of the union representing SBA workers said he’s been hearing about “issues” with E-Tran since Friday. The system is used by SBA-approved lenders to send applications to SBA to get a loan registered and receive a guarantee number, and non-SBA lenders use it to get registered to participate in the program.
“They can’t get into the system,” said Johnnie Green, national president of The American Federation of Government Employees Local 228, referring to lenders. According to Green, his union represents more than 1,000 SBA employees. Green said he was told by SBA employees that a fix was expected Monday, but he wasn’t sure whether the issue had been corrected.
Amazon Web Services, the largest provider of cloud computing services and a major seller of software to the federal government, was brought on last week as subcontractor by a company working to build a new software tool for banks participating in the SBA program, according to a person familiar with the matter. That project, designed to expedite work lenders seeking to become registered to participate in the program, isn’t finished yet, the person said.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio, chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, tweeted on Sunday there were “signs of progress” on the system upgrade and that by 8 p.m., a Florida bank with 4,000 loan applications could get 70 of its officers onto E-Tran -- after only 20 could previously.
But the ability of lenders to connect with SBA on Monday -- both SBA-approved lenders trying to process loans and those trying to get registered to participate -- seemed to be about the same as it was on Friday, said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America.
The ICBA sent a letter to SBA and Treasury late Saturday night complaining about the technology and a “myriad of unanswered questions and lack of clear instruction on how to complete loans through the SBA.” The group made several recommendations, including enhancing SBA systems.
Merski said community lenders are still looking for guidance from SBA on how to complete some loans, including when a firm’s officers are also on a lender’s board or serve as a director."

There are different pots of money for different kinds of companies. Banks on Friday began accepting applications for the $350 billion available for small and medium companies under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, established as part of the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package.
The Treasury and the Federal Reserve are still working on how to deploy more than $500 billion to purchase corporate and local government securities and provide aid for airlines, as well as companies like Boeing deemed essential for national security.
So how do you access the cash? Here’s a guide for some of the benefits that are available and how to qualify:
Small Businesses
• Benefit: SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program. Up to $10 million per small business or nonprofit organization. Almost $350 billion will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Business can get a loan at 1% interest to cover up to 250% of average monthly payroll costs -- including group health insurance premiums, retirement contributions and state and local payroll taxes, even cash tips that the employer recorded. The loan will be forgiven for businesses that retain or rehire workers to restore their Feb. 15 headcount. If a company lays off workers or reduces payroll expenses, the loan forgiveness will be reduced or eliminated.
Who is eligible: Companies with fewer than 500 employees or otherwise meet the SBA’s definition of a small business, small nonprofits including religious organizations and even self-employed people who certify that the loan request is necessary to support ongoing operations given the pandemic’s economic uncertainty. Small businesses in the hospitality and food industry with more than one location can also be eligible if their individual locations employ less than 500 workers.
How to get it: Apply through a participating bank or lender. A sample two-page application form is available from the SBA website. Be sure to have appropriate documents showing payroll records for the entire previous year and payroll costs for the period including Feb. 15. Also bring records showing the business’s utility costs and rent or mortgage interest costs. If the company doesn’t have an existing relationship with the lender, be prepared to satisfy Bank Secrecy Act requirements to prove the business is legitimate and show the identities of those with a beneficial interest.
Special limitation: The money is capped at an annualized payroll rate of $100,000 per worker.
Bottom line: Get in line fast for this first-come, first-serve program. This is a no-brainer if you qualify, and tens of millions of businesses and nonprofits could be swamping bank offices in the coming weeks. The deadline for getting the loan is June 30, or until money runs out.
Airlines and Related Companies
• Benefit: Up to $32 billion in payroll grants for airlines, contractors and cargo carriers, controlled by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Who is eligible: Airlines, contractors like catering companies, and air cargo haulers can get a combined $32 billion in grants to pay their workers.
How to get it: Companies need to continue flying routes required by the government and keep their employees on payrolls through Sept. 30. Outside firms are advising Mnuchin on the terms he should set, including what he will demand from airlines in return, such as warrants for equity in the companies. Mnuchin has said the money should be more than a bailout. He has solicited proposals from the airlines for terms on receiving the aid and has issued guidance.
• Benefit: Airlines and cargo carriers can also apply for loans from a $29 billion pot.
Who is eligible: The same airlines and cargo companies eligible for the grants also have the option to apply for these loans.
How to get it: Companies also need to go through Treasury to get these loans.
National Security Companies
• Benefit: Up to $17 billion in loans for companies deemed crucial for national security.
Who is eligible: Boeing, with its aircraft manufacturing and broad supply chain, will be one of the clearest beneficiaries, although the law doesn’t specifically mention the company.
How to get it: The companies also need to go through Treasury to get these loans.
Corporations and Local Governments
• Benefit: The Federal Reserve has access to at least $454 billion it can use to leverage trillions of dollars in facilities intended to back up companies as well as state and local governments.
Who is eligible: This will be up to the Federal Reserve.
How to get it: The Federal Reserve facilities are still evolving. Mnuchin said lots of companies will be able to participate through broad facilities for both larger companies like energy firms and Main Street businesses.
Special limitations: The law includes restrictions on executive pay and stock buybacks for firms that access this aid. Congress set up a series of oversight mechanisms to review how all of that cash gets spent, including a special inspector general, an accountability committee of relevant government departments and an oversight panel.
Other Perks Available: Tax Cuts and Deferrals
• Benefit: Turn business losses into cash refunds
Who is eligible: Any company that lost money in 2018, 2019 or 2020 but turned a profit in the past five years.
How to get it: If a firm can show losses from 2018 or 2019, it can go back five years to offset past profits and ask the IRS for a refund now. The IRS has not yet issued guidance about how to claim those refunds, but in the past the IRS has reimbursed companies within 45 days. If a business has losses this year, it can take the losses at the beginning of next year.
• Benefit: Tax Payment Delay
Who is eligible: Companies of all sizes and individuals can delay filing their 2019 tax returns, paying any outstanding tax liability and submitting estimated taxes for the first quarter of 2020 until July 15.
How to get it: No action is needed for the extended due date for income taxes. The IRS also allows companies to delay filing their taxes until October 15, but that requires a form requesting an extension with the agency. Tax bills that aren’t paid by July 15 will start accruing interest and penalties, even for companies approved to file the return in October.
• Benefit: Payroll Tax Deferral
Who is eligible: Corporations can also put off paying the employer-side payroll taxes they owe for up to two years. One exception: companies that get their Payroll Protection Program loans forgiven can’t defer their payroll taxes.
How to get it: Companies can defer paying all of the 6.2% payroll levies they owe the government for the rest of 2020 and can spread those payments out over 2021 and 2022. At least half must be submitted by the end of 2021.
• Benefit: Employee retention tax credit
Who is eligible: Companies of all sizes and non-profits forced to close or slow business could be eligible for a refundable tax credit if they keep workers on the job. Firms that get Payroll Protection Program loans can’t claim this tax break either. Companies with more than 100 employees can only claim the tax credit against wages paid to employees with work curtailed by the pandemic.
How to get it: Employers can get up to $5,000 per worker they keep on the job during the downturn. The credit is applied against payroll taxes, submitted quarterly, but companies can also ask for an advance using these instructions and form from the IRS. The tax break is refundable, meaning businesses can get a check back from the IRS if companies have amassed credits larger than their payroll tax bills.
• Benefit: Tax credit for paid sick and family leave
Who is eligible: Employers with fewer than 500 employees can receive dollar-for-dollar tax credits that reimburse them for providing paid sick and family leave wages for workers who have to take leave related to the virus. Self-employed individuals are also able to claim a similar credit. One important caveat: Paid sick and family leave reimbursed by the tax credit is excluded from the payroll costs that can be claimed as part of the Payroll Protection Program.
How to get it: Employers that offer workers up to 80 hours of paid sick leave and up to an additional 10 weeks to care for a child due to school closures can claim the credit for wages paid starting April 1. Companies can claim the tax breaks on their quarterly federal employment tax returns, but they can benefit more quickly from the credits by reducing their employment tax deposits. If the credit amount is larger than the federal employment taxes, companies can request an advance payment of the credits from the IRS."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/06/3m-will-import-masks-china-us-resolve-dispute-with-trump-administration/,The Washington Post,3M will import masks from China for U.S. to resolve dispute with Trump administration,"3M has agreed to import millions of protective masks for U.S. health-care workers after falling into a dispute with the Trump administration about shortages of the critical protective wear, President Trump and the company said Monday.
3M, based in Minnesota, said it will import 166.5 million masks over the next three months, mostly from its factory in China.
Trump last week invoked the Defense Production Act in relation to 3M, saying he was not happy with the company’s delivery of N95 masks to U.S. health-care workers fighting the novel coronavirus. The DPA order required 3M to prioritize orders from the federal government.
At a briefing Monday, Trump said he had resolved things with the manufacturing giant after speaking with 3M chief executive Michael Roman.
“We have reached an agreement, a very amicable agreement, with 3M for the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high-quality face masks each month, so that we’re going to be getting over the next couple of months 166.5 million masks for our front-line health-care workers,” Trump said. “So the 3M saga ends very happily.”
3M was already making 35 million N95 masks a month in the United States, mostly for the U.S. market. But hospitals have still grappled with shortages of protective equipment.
3M said it exports a “small proportion” of its U.S. production to Canada and Latin America. Last week, the company said the Trump administration had asked it to stop those exports, to make more masks available for U.S. use. That prompted complaints from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
On Monday, 3M said its new deal with the Trump administration “will also enable 3M to continue sending U.S. produced respirators to Canada and Latin America, where 3M is the primary source of supply.”
3M’s factory in China has largely produced masks for the Chinese and Asian markets. In February, presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro complained in an interview with Fox Business that China had moved to “nationalize, effectively, 3M, our company . . . to prevent them from sending us any stuff.”
In its statement Monday, 3M said the White House has “committed to working to address and remove export and regulatory restrictions to enable this plan.”
3M makes N95 masks for two uses — medical and industrial. Both types filter at least 95 percent of airborne particles, but they vary in design and fit. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency order allowing the sale of industrial masks to health-care users, as a way to ease the shortages.
3M didn’t respond to a request for comment about whether the masks to be imported from China were designed for industrial or medical use."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/06/boeing-closure-south-carolina/,The Washington Post,Boeing to close production facilities in S.C.,"Boeing for now will shutter its 787 passenger jet production operations in North Charleston, S.C., to protect employees and stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, the company announced Monday.
The shutdown will affect most of the 7,000 Boeing employees at four facilities. They’ll get 10 days of paid leave, which a company spokesman described as “double the company policy,” and then will be eligible for unemployment benefits.
Those whose jobs allow them to work from home will continue to work, the company said.
“It is our commitment to focus on the health and safety of our teammates while assessing the spread of the virus across the state, its impact on the reliability of our global supply chain and that ripple effect on the 787 program,” said Brad Zaback, vice president and general manager of the company’s 787 program. “We are working in alignment with state and local government officials and public health officials to take actions that best protect our people.”
The South Carolina factory shutdown is the latest of several actions by the Chicago-based aerospace giant that highlight its struggle to deal with the economic and personal fallout from the global pandemic.
The company also has halted operations in western Washington state, the center of its commercial production, and offered buyouts at the heavily unionized factories there. It also stopped operations at military aircraft production facilities in Pennsylvania.
The company has promised to deep-clean the facilities while workers are away. More than 100 Boeing employees have tested positive for the virus, most of them in Washington.
The plant closures also come at a time when airlines have canceled thousands of flights and orders for new planes as global air travel grinds to a halt.
Even before the public health crisis, Boeing had hit historic financial lows. Its best-selling 737 Max has been grounded for more than a year as the company struggles to fix a control system blamed in two crashes that killed 346 people. The company’s commercial aerospace division lost a quarter of its revenue as a result.
The virus presents a new challenge, as cash-strapped airlines begin to cancel orders. Most recently, aircraft leasing company Avalon canceled a $3.8 billion order for 737 Max jets."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-airlines-dont-want-to-refund-your-flight-tickets/2020/04/06/14525cb8-77f3-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,Why Airlines Don’t Want to Refund Your Flight Tickets,"In documents published alongside Carnival Corp.’s $6.25 billion debt and equity offering last week, the beleaguered cruise ship operator showed why it might not keep much of that cash for long.
Carnival held $4.7 billion in customer deposits at the end of February for trips that passengers paid for in advance but hadn’t yet taken. Because their cruises have been cancelled amid the coronavirus outbreak, many customers will want their money back. As such, Carnival could soon find itself short of cash again.
Carnival’s predicament is shared by hundreds of travel, airline, sports, education and entertainment businesses — all of which depend on advanced payment from customers to fund their operations. People probably don’t realize it, but when they pay for a ticket months in advance they’re effectively extending these companies an interest-free loan. The world’s airlines might have to repay $35 billion in customer cash during the next three months, according to industry body IATA; the largest of these companies each held close to $5 billion in customer advance payments at the end of December, corporate filings show. 
What happens to this customer money is a hugely important question that could determine whether businesses will remain solvent or will need a government bailout. Tour operator Tui AG, for example, secured a 1.8 billion-euro ($1.9 billion) rescue loan from the German government last month, even though it had taken in about 2.9 billion euros of advance payments from customers — it had spent much of this cash.
There are sound reasons why companies should be allowed to hold onto customer money: Taxpayers would foot a rescue bill, which doesn’t seem very fair when it’s estimated that just 15% of Brits take 70% of the country’s international flights. 
By pulling their cash out now — rather than waiting for rescheduled holidays, flights and events, or accepting a credit voucher to book a future alternative — customers’ risk destabilizing businesses that they admire and depend upon. 
But it’s essential too that customer money is adequately protected and people who urgently need their money back, such as those who’ve recently lost their jobs, can get it.
That’s why there’s such disagreement around the travel industry’s preferred solution to the problem: the credit voucher. Like the airlines, Carnival hopes that people will accept these to put toward a future trip in lieu of cash. So far about 45% of customers have chosen this option. But the travel industry is worried that this voluntary uptake isn’t enough. Hence it is furiously lobbying governments to allow companies to insist on making the vouchers non-optional.
This would require the suspension of consumer protection laws. While governments like Germany and the Netherlands are sympathetic to their domestic companies’ plight and are encouraging the use of vouchers, the European Union and the U.S. have held firm, saying that if customers want their money back, they should get it. They worry that if a company goes bust, customers with vouchers would join a long queue of unsecured creditors.
In theory, European holidaymakers’ prepayments are protected if a tour operator becomes insolvent. But when Thomas Cook collapsed last year, the Air Travel Trust Fund that’s used to repay U.K. customers was drained of most of its cash. Similarly, Thomas Cook’s insurance didn’t adequately protect German customers; German taxpayers ended up refunding those customers.  
There are other ways for consumers to get their money back if a company goes bust. Some travel insurance policies will pay out for an insolvency, as will credit-card processors. Still, the safest way to protect your money is to not allow a distressed company to keep the cash in the first place.
In the hope that governments will come round to their point of view, some airlines have reportedly been complicating the refund process for customers. By stonewalling, they’re able to keep the cash a bit longer but at the cost of alienating customers and travel agents. 
A much better approach is to offer customers an incentive to take the voucher option. Finnair Oyj customers can get vouchers worth 10% more than their cancelled booking.
To make sure holidaymakers can get their money back when needed or are protected in the event of a company’s collapse, governments also need financial safety nets and insolvency guarantees. Germany has proposed something like this, without providing details. It also plans a hardship clause for customers that can’t afford to accept a voucher. As an alternative, governments might consider a travel emergency fund to cover reimbursement of flights and other services so businesses don’t immediately have to foot the bill. 
By taking a voucher, customers can help prevent scores of unnecessary insolvencies. But they mustn’t be punished for showing a little love. "
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/07/coronavirus-ventilators-respiratory-therapists/,The Washington Post,Respiratory therapists are keeping many covid patients on ventilators alive,"Many doctors and surgeons have already been — or are going to be — repurposed to take care of covid-19 patients as hospitals get overwhelmed. For some of us, this will mean treating conditions that we haven’t dealt with since medical school. And this might include putting breathing tubes into patients and using ventilators, which few doctors do routinely.
Sure, many of us have broad enough experience that we can safely do the procedure. But as hospitals surge with patients experiencing coronavirus-related respiratory illness, one group of front-line workers is absolutely essential in managing these patients and running ventilators: respiratory therapists. These front-line workers are truly the unsung heroes in this battle. Not only do they run the machines, but in many instances, they also have more close contact with covid-19 patients than anyone else in the hospital — which means they’re putting themselves in more danger.
My first encounter with a respiratory therapist was as a surgery resident managing a busy critical-care unit in the middle of the night. I was paged overhead. “Dr. Sathya, please report immediately to patient X’s room for respiratory distress.” I ran over and saw the patient was gasping for air. It was obvious the patient needed to be intubated with a breathing tube and quickly placed on a ventilator. I had done this before as a medical student but had no idea where to start.
That’s when I saw the respiratory therapist, who arrived within seconds and had already prepared the equipment, drugs and ventilator needed. I thought to myself, “All I have to do is put the tube into the patient’s airway.” But I was sweating bullets. The respiratory therapist kept me calm and told me exactly what to do. The breathing tube slid nicely into the patient’s airway. The respiratory therapist hooked the patient up to the ventilator and single-handedly worked the machine over the next week, making sure it safely pushed air into the patient’s lungs and maintained proper oxygen levels.
This was one of many times a respiratory therapist saved the day throughout my career. They serve as the glue that brings everything together when we doctors manage patients with respiratory illnesses. They’re often the first to be called by nurses when a patient is having trouble breathing. They know more about oxygen, breathing support and ventilators than most others in the hospital. They work complex machines, suction secretions from the airway, take patients off the ventilators and, in many hospitals, they even position the breathing tube in the first place or teach trainees how to do so.
As we battle this pandemic, the importance of respiratory therapists has never been more apparent. Yet most people outside hospital settings don’t even know the job exists. “Medical shows [on TV] often show respiratory procedures but never show or mention respiratory therapists, who are critical,” said Tom Kallstrom, executive director and chief executive of the American Association for Respiratory Care and a respiratory therapist himself. “We are right in patients’ faces every day, suctioning up their secretions, inserting and removing breathing tubes, and much more.” Being so close to the patients means a higher risk of contact with secretions, which may contain viruses, Kallstrom said.
Since many hospitals are understaffed with respiratory therapists — typically, a single therapist is responsible for many patients — they’re probably going into more covid-19 patient rooms than almost anyone else. Managing ventilators is labor-intensive, so they often have to spend a long time in each room. This all adds up to an elevated exposure risk.
“Patients on ventilators needs a lot of support,” said Brady Scott, a respiratory therapist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “We have to constantly make sure they are breathing safely on the device. We try to mitigate as much as possible, with [personal protective equipment] and avoiding the room when possible, but being in the room to work the breathing equipment is a big part of our job.”
Managing a ventilator is much more than turning knobs; it’s a complicated process. You have to know exactly how to interpret and understand the feedback the ventilator is providing, adjust as needed, make sure the equipment is working and ensure the patient is getting the right amount of oxygen without damaging the lungs from too much pressure, Scott said.
As the virus ravages our hospitals, every worker — whether cleaning staff, nurses, physician assistants, cafeteria employees, social workers, security personnel or others — is invaluable in this fight. Each makes a vital contribution, without which hospitals wouldn’t be able to function. As we brace for the eventual peak of the pandemic and an overwhelming number of patients needing ventilators, respiratory therapists — whom we can’t run all the ventilators without — will be front and center. “I am scared to death that despite my best efforts and PPE, I can still bring the virus home to my family,” Scott said. “I have a 4-year-old daughter. But patients need us, so without a question, I put on PPE and go back into battle every day.”"
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/japan-opts-for-emergency-but-no-lockdown--keeping-its-eye-on-economy/2020/04/07/16145058-78a5-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,"Japan opts for emergency but ‘no lockdown,’ keeping its eye on the economy","TOKYO — It's a state of emergency over Tokyo, but no lockdown.
On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency for about a month in Tokyo and six other prefectures most severely affected by the coronavirus.
In a televised news conference, Abe asked people to refrain from going outside needlessly. But he said that the government “will not lock cities down as has been done overseas” and that economic activity will be maintained as much as possible. He also announced an “unprecedented” economic rescue package, equivalent to about 20 percent of Japan’s gross domestic product.
“It is of the utmost importance to change the behavior of citizens,” Abe said. “If all of us make an effort and try to reduce person-to-person contact by 70 percent or, preferably, 80 percent, the increase in infections will peak in two weeks and shift to a decline.”
Abe said Japan was not seeing a rapid nationwide spread of the virus, but he cautioned that the medical systems in some regions were under pressure, “so we have no luxury of time.”
The state of emergency covers Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures, plus the city of Osaka and two other prefectures in southwestern Japan.
The announcement exasperated many people.
The government, they say, has dithered in the face of an explosion in infections in the capital and is still reluctant to impose the sort of extreme measures necessary to contain the virus — largely because of concerns about the economic impact.
“It’s too late,” said Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute for Population Health at King’s College, London, who warned that the Japanese capital could soon face the sort of calamitous rise in infections and deaths that New York is experiencing.
“Tokyo has already entered an explosive phase, and the only way to stop the collapse in health care was to lock down the city as early as possible.”
Abe urged people not to leave Tokyo or Osaka, since they could spread the virus to smaller towns where many vulnerable elderly people live. “What we have to fear is fear itself,” he said, echoing President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s memorable 1933 remark during the Great Depression. He argued that the risks of infection in Tokyo were “not really high” compared with overseas cities where more extensive lockdowns were put in place.
But he asked people to avoid going to bars, nightclubs, karaoke parlors or live music venues and to refrain from dining out in large groups — although there will be no penalties for noncompliance. Walking and jogging are fine, he said, while restaurants should be well ventilated and put space between diners.
He asked companies to institute remote working where possible — or at least stagger working hours and reduce contact among employees. Schools will remain closed, but trains and buses will run, and “essential” services will stay open, he said.
But what constitutes an essential service? Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said she would provide details by Thursday of places asked to close their doors. But under a draft plan obtained by the Mainichi newspaper, health-care facilities, supermarkets, convenience stores, hotels, factories and public baths will remain open, while restaurants may be asked to cut their hours.
Museums, libraries, cinemas, Internet cafes, department stores, malls and gyms may be asked to shutter, although there may be exceptions for small businesses.
For many experts, this is too little, too late.
Infections are surging in Japan, with about 250 new cases reported Monday and the cumulative total topping 4,100. It’s in the capital that the crisis is most acute, with more than 1,000 people hospitalized and beds already at full capacity.
The hazard lights were flashing two weeks ago, as experts warned that a second wave of infections was taking hold. But restaurants and bars were still busy, and thousands of pachinko parlors — crowded, smoky venues that host a form of legal gambling — remained open.
Six days ago, the Japan Medical Association warned that the medical situation had become critical and urged the government to declare a state of emergency.
The same day, the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine said the country had only five intensive-care units per 100,000 people, half the level of Italy, and warned that “a surge in terms of the number of deaths will come very soon.” The government’s expert panel then said it was “highly likely” that the disease was rampant.
That, said Shibuya, was pretty much the last chance to stop the explosion.
Part of the problem: The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has extremely close ties with the business community, while Abe is keen to preserve his long attempt to revive Japan’s sluggish economy, policies known as Abenomics.
So while Abe moved swiftly to ask schools to close at the end of February — even though his expert panel said such a move was premature — he has been much slower to take action that would undermine the economy.
Japan has been lulled into a false sense of security partly by a lack of widespread testing for the virus but also by its early success in containing the epidemic, which was based on tracing and isolating clusters of infections.
There was also a sense of exceptionalism: that the widespread use of masks, good standards of hygiene and lack of physical contact were helping to contain the virus, and that the country could avoid the sort of dramatic lockdowns seen elsewhere.
Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University, said the lack of testing created a lack of transparency, while policies were incoherent and lacked direction.
“The government is so much more focused on trying to provide lifelines to the corporate sector,” Nakano said.
Shibuya said the government’s expert panel lacked the wide range of talents that was needed and excluded the sort of outspoken academics who might have raised the alarm earlier. Instead, the panel has fallen in line behind a set of policies that suits the agenda of the government and the corporate sector.
But in recent days, the tide has begun to turn, with big businesses moving in favor of firmer action.
“They want to see conditions resolved sooner — even at the expense of immediate pain,” said Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at the Nomura Research Institute. “It is small businesses that wanted Abe not to act so soon.”"
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2020/04/07/trump-removes-inspector-general-who-was-to-oversee-2-trillion-stimulus-spending/,The Washington Post,Trump removes inspector general who was to oversee $2 trillion stimulus spending,"President Trump has removed the chairman of the federal panel Congress created to oversee his administration’s management of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package — the latest action by the president to undermine the system of independent oversight of the executive established after Watergate.
In just the past four days, Trump has ousted two inspectors general and expressed displeasure with a third, a pattern that critics say is a direct assault on one of the pillars of good governance.
Glenn Fine, who had been the acting Pentagon inspector general, was informed Monday that he was being replaced at the Defense Department by Sean W. O’Donnell, currently the inspector general at the Environmental Protection Agency. O’Donnell will simultaneously be inspector general at the EPA and acting IG at the Pentagon until a permanent replacement is confirmed for the Defense Department.
Late last month, Fine was selected by the head of a council of inspectors general to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, created by the March 27 law.
On Friday, the president notified Congress that he was removing Michael Atkinson as the inspector general of the intelligence community — a decision that Trump acknowledged was in response to Atkinson’s having alerted lawmakers to the existence of a whistleblower complaint about the president’s dealings with Ukraine. The matter ultimately led to Trump’s impeachment in the House before his acquittal in the Senate.
Trump has also refused dozens of congressional subpoenas and asserted to the courts that they lack jurisdiction to oversee his responses to Congress.
“We wanted inspectors general because of an out-of-control president named Richard Nixon, and this president is trying to destroy them,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. “What’s happened this week has been a total full-on assault on the IG system.”
Fine is a career official who has served Republican and Democratic presidents. He had been acting Pentagon inspector general for more than four years, and before that was inspector general at the Justice Department for 11 years. Fine and his staff were caught by surprise when informed of the decision Monday and were given no explanation for the move, according to federal officials.
Trump cast his decision to remove Fine as merely cleaning house of Obama-era holdover appointments, saying those officials could be biased.
“We have a lot of IGs in from the Obama era,” he said Tuesday. “And as you know, it’s a presidential decision. And I left them, largely. I mean, changed some, but I left them. . . . But when we have, you know, reports of bias and when we have different things coming in. I don’t know Fine. I don’t think I ever met Fine.”
Defense Department spokeswoman Dwrena K. Allen confirmed that Fine “is no longer on the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.”
Because he is no longer acting inspector general, Fine is ineligible to hold the spending watchdog role. He will, however, continue to serve in his current position of principal deputy inspector general at the Pentagon. He had held both the acting and deputy positions.
On Monday, Trump nominated Jason Abend, senior policy adviser at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to be the permanent inspector general at the Defense Department.
The $2 trillion coronavirus emergency spending law, known as the Cares Act, created several layers of oversight, including the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.
It will now be up to Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general and chairman and the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, to appoint a new stimulus spending watchdog head.
The new law mandated that the group conduct and coordinate audits, with investigators looking for waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer money in the disbursement of loans, loan guarantees and financial payments to households and businesses. The oversight mechanisms were the subject of contentious negotiations between Republicans and Democrats. Trump, when signing the bill into law, questioned the constitutionality of the provisions and asserted in a statement that the administration will not allow the inspector general to provide certain information to Congress without “presidential supervision,” calling it a violation of executive branch authority.
Fine’s removal, which was first reported by Politico, drew criticism from Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) called Fine’s removal “part of a disturbing pattern of retaliation by the president against independent overseers fulfilling their statutory and patriotic duties to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people.”
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, “President Trump is abusing the coronavirus pandemic to eliminate honest and independent public servants because they are willing to speak truth to power and because he is so clearly afraid of strong oversight.”
Paul Rosenzweig, a Department of Homeland Security political appointee in the George W. Bush administration, blasted the president’s removal of Fine as “an affront to independence and oversight.”
Said Rosenzweig: “Frankly, if the House of Representatives does not condition all further covid aid on the restriction of the president’s removal authority, they will have made a mistake.”
Trump also has on his radar the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, whose office Monday released a survey of more than 300 hospitals across the country finding that the top complaint was a “severe” and “widespread” shortage of testing supplies and protective gear.
That finding contrasted with Trump’s rosier assessment that the country had carried out more covid-19 testing than any other in the world — nearly 1.8 million tests to date. Trump seemed perturbed by reporters’ questions asking him to square his remarks with the survey conducted by the HHS watchdog.
“So give me the name of the inspector general,” he said. “Could politics be entered into that?”
Christi A. Grimm, the agency’s principal deputy inspector general since January, began working for the inspector general’s office at HHS in 1999 and, like Fine, has served under both Republican and Democratic presidents.
On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted disparagingly about Grimm, selectively highlighting her service during the Obama administration.
“Why didn’t the I.G., who spent 8 years with the Obama Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, V.P. & others in charge, before doing her report,” he tweeted. “Another Fake Dossier!”
The Cares Act also created a special inspector general at the Treasury Department to oversee the spending of $500 billion of the stimulus package. Trump has signaled his intent to nominate White House lawyer Brian Miller to serve as the new special inspector general, whose work will be coordinated by the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.
Miller, a former General Services Administration inspector general in the Bush and Obama administrations, gets good marks from watchdog groups, though there is some skepticism about his independence given his White House role.
Inspectors general have existed in the military since the country’s founding, but Congress established the position in statute in 1978 in response to Nixon’s abuse of executive power during the Watergate scandal. The idea was that the watchdogs would investigate wrongdoing in the agency and report to the agency head as well as Congress.
“That’s what made that law so special,” said Brian of the Project on Government Oversight. “The inspector general is unlike any other position in government, where a member of the executive branch is authorized to speak directly to Congress. That’s where they derive their power.”
But the Inspector General Act still permits a president essentially to fire inspectors general at will, as long as Congress is notified in writing with an explanation. The House in 2008 passed a measure that would have required the president to have “cause,” to include abuse of authority, malfeasance and conviction of a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude. But the measure failed in the Senate.
“The only way we will be able to save the entire IG system is if the Congress passes those protections,” Brian said, “because what’s happened this week is going to make it impossible for any IG to be able to conduct their job with the vigor you would want — because they know they’ll get fired.”"
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/07/wisconsin-shows-fragility-democracy/,The Washington Post,Wisconsin shows the fragility of democracy,"The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a final blow Monday to changes that would have enabled a safe and orderly election, overruling a federal district court decision allowing extension of the deadline for voters to return absentee ballots.
The court insisted delay of the election was not at issue, although the governor had sought to do precisely that. The majority wrote: “Wisconsin has decided to proceed with the elections scheduled for Tuesday, April 7. The wisdom of that decision is not the question before the Court. The question before the Court is a narrow, technical question about the absentee ballot process.” Bizarrely, the majority also wrote that delaying the deadline to return absentee ballots — with more time to disseminate ballots and educate voters, providing safer means of voting for thousands of voters — “fundamentally alters the nature of the election.” True! It would make it safer (fewer people would have to risk exposing themselves to the coronavirus at the polls) and would encourage more participation, something Republicans apparently fear. (The district court also ordered the election commission to withhold the results of balloting until the absentee ballot deadline passed.)
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s stinging dissent should be mandatory reading for every American. “The Court’s order requires absentee voters to postmark their ballots by election day, April 7 — i.e., tomorrow — even if they did not receive their ballots by that date. That is a novel requirement,” she observed. She continued: “While I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, the Court’s order, I fear, will result in massive disenfranchisement. A voter cannot deliver for postmarking a ballot she has not received.”
Ginsburg slapped down the court’s notion that delaying the date to return ballots would be confusing. “Election officials have spent the past few days establishing procedures and informing voters in accordance with the District Court’s deadline. For this Court to upend the process — a day before the April 7 postmark deadline — is sure to confound election officials and voters.” She concludes:
The result, as we witness today, is that voters fearing disenfranchisement line up at the polls (observing social distancing at least while in line). The result, as Ginsburg anticipates, will be twofold: 1) Some voters who decide to risk voting in person will likely become ill, and some could die; and 2) Those who prioritize their health but have not received their absentee ballot will lose the right to vote. It is hard to disagree that the Supreme Court’s decision is among the most irresponsible and anti-democratic in recent memory.
Freedom House, which monitors threats to democracy around the globe, issued a rare statement on American elections in response to the court’s decision: “The emerging debacle surrounding the Wisconsin primary demonstrates the crucial need to take strong measures to protect elections during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. “From our research on elections in countries around the world, we know that flawed responses to the health crisis have the potential to undermine the confidence of constituents in their governments.” The statement added, “We should not push forward with unsafe elections when there are alternatives, especially because doing so is likely to disenfranchise large parts of the electorate. This is a time for political parties everywhere to work together and compromise. It is more important that we assure voters of the validity of our elections, than win an immediate partisan victory.”
We can admire the tenacity of Wisconsin voters willing to risk their lives to exercise their sacred right to vote, a tribute to democracy that puts the Supreme Court majority to shame. The lesson, however, should be clear: Republican politicians and conservative justices will not shy from making voting difficult, dangerous and confusing. Their highest goal is not robust elections, but elections in which fewer voters turn out. To preserve wide participation and credible election results, Democrats must act now to petition state governments for expanded voting by mail.
Republicans’ motives (think, suppress voting) are obnoxious and anti-democratic, but their reasoning is also faulty. In November, if covid-19 still rages, won’t older, more conservative voters be the ones huddling at home? The refusal to protect voting by instituting voting by mail will endanger lives and may not “work” to achieve the desired results. Republicans may well be shooting themselves in the foot by making it more difficult for their own voters to cast ballots. The casualties of this assault on elections will include many voters who are especially vulnerable to the virus, as well as democracy itself."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/navy-leader-faces-political-heat-and-calls-for-his-resignation-over-handling-of-virus-stricken-aircraft-carrier/2020/04/07/ff072bd2-78dc-11ea-8cec-530b4044a458_story.html,The Washington Post,Navy leader faces political heat and calls for his resignation over handling of virus-stricken aircraft carrier,"The top civilian leader in the U.S. Navy is facing pressure to resign from Democrats, including the powerful chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, over his handling of a public health crisis on the coronavirus-stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier.
Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly apologized late Monday for profanity-laced comments he made to the aircraft carrier’s crew in Guam days after firing the ship’s commanding officer, Capt. Brett Crozier. Crozier had expressed alarm about the service’s mishandling of the health crisis on the vessel in a March 30 letter to Navy higher-ups that subsequently leaked to the media.
Modly had parachuted in to Guam on a damage-control mission after the nearly 5,000-person crew of the aircraft carrier erupted in cheers of support for their fired captain. But Modly’s attempt to explain his decision to the crew and tamp down a burgeoning national scandal had the opposite effect. In his remarks, Modly said Crozier was either too stupid or naive to be the commander, or leaked the letter to the media. Many sailors were outraged.
Soon, Modly found himself even further on the defensive. Sailors aboard the carrier — where 173 people including Crozier had tested positive for covid-19 as of Monday — deemed the acting Navy secretary’s comments disrespectful to their former captain and leaked a recording to the public.
In his apology to Crozier and the Theodore Roosevelt’s crew, Modly clarified that he did not think the captain was naive or stupid and said he regretted any pain the remarks may have caused.
But Modly simultaneously doubled down on his defense of Crozier’s firing, suggesting the top Navy officer was smart enough to know better than sending such a letter that risked public knowledge of discontent and chaos aboard the carrier.
“Captain Crozier is smart and passionate,” Modly said. “I believe, precisely because he is not naive and stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship. I apologize for any confusion this choice of words may have caused.”
The situation has caused a crisis of confidence in the leadership of the Navy and in particular in Modly, a Naval helicopter pilot turned businessman who stepped into the service’s top political appointee in an acting capacity after his predecessor, Richard V. Spencer, was fired late last year amid a scandal over President Trump’s intervention in a Navy SEAL war crimes case.
The situation comes as the latest challenge for a Navy that has struggled in recent years with leadership turmoil in its ranks. A scandal over a Malaysian defense contractor nicknamed “Fat Leonard” who bribed Navy officials with cash, prostitutes and other incentives tarnished many would-be officers who had been seen as leading candidates for top service posts.
The 2017 collisions of the guided missile destroyers the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain led to 17 deaths among the sailors on board and raised further questions about Navy leadership. The turmoil over the president’s intervention in the Navy SEAL case has left the service without a permanent political appointee at its helm for months.
The result has left Modly — a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and the Harvard Business School — in the hot seat atop the service.
Rise of a little-known official
The son of Eastern European immigrants who moved to the United States after World War II, Modly was raised in Cleveland, according to his official Navy biography. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1983 and served as a Navy helicopter pilot before leaving active duty service in 1990 to attend business school. He worked as an executive at a number of companies, including most recently at the consulting firm PwC, where he handled the NATO account, before being tapped in 2017 as undersecretary of the Navy for the Trump administration.
Now Modly has gone from being a little-known behind-the-scenes official atop the Navy bureaucracy, who served as the service’s chief management and chief information officer, to the public face of one of its most explosive national scandals in recent years, one that has pitted a captain praised for sacrificing his career in service to his crew against a Trump administration already facing criticism for a sluggish and haphazard response to the covid-19 pandemic.
The incident has raised serious questions about how much transparency the military should display when faced with a public health crisis and how top leaders should balance the need to safeguard the well-being of service members with the imperative to continue military missions.
Upon becoming public, Crozier’s letter fed into the very narrative that the White House was looking to dispel about leadership in Washington failing to take serious enough steps in early days to contain the outbreak. His firing has been seen among the aircraft carrier’s crew as an attempt to muzzle any leaks of information about the situation on the vessel that could become politically inconvenient for top officers and civilian appointees back in Washington.
Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who has significant influence over the Navy’s budget, called for Modly’s resignation in a statement.
“I disagree strongly with the manner in which acting Secretary of the Navy Modly has handled the covid-19 outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt. His decision to relieve Captain Crozier was at best an overreaction to the extraordinary steps the Captain took to protect his crew,” Smith said.
“Acting Secretary Modly’s decision to address the sailors on the Roosevelt and personally attack Captain Crozier shows a tone-deaf approach more focused on personal ego than one of the calm, steady leadership we so desperately need in this crisis,” Smith added.
A spokesman for Modly did not respond to a request for an interview.
Trump has said he was not involved in the decision to fire Crozier. The president initially supported Modly and attacked Crozier’s letter as terrible. But Trump moderated his stance after news of the acting Navy secretary’s controversial remarks broke.
At a news conference Monday, Trump maintained that Crozier should not have sent the letter but said he had been hearing good things about the captain and his career before that. “So, I’m going to get involved and see what is going on there because I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day,” Trump said.
Though both the Pentagon and the White House have said Trump was not personally involved in the decision to fire Crozier, the specter of earning the president’s ire drove Modly’s decision to fire the captain before conducting a thorough investigation.
In an interview with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, Modly said what happened to his predecessor, who got “crosswise” with the White House over Trump’s intervention in the war crimes case of Navy SEAL Edward “Eddie” Gallagher, was fresh in his mind when he decided to fire Crozier. Modly essentially said he took such swift action to prevent a personal intervention by Trump.
“I didn’t want to get into a decision where the president would feel that he had to intervene because the Navy couldn’t be decisive,” Modly said. “If I were president, and I saw a commanding officer of a ship exercising such poor judgment, I would be asking why the leadership of the Navy wasn’t taking action itself.”
Modly said he was aware his predecessor lost his job because the Navy “got crossways with the president,” and said, “I didn’t want that to happen again.”
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley both signed off on Crozier’s firing, trusting Modly’s decision. The top officer in the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday, did not want Crozier to be fired but ultimately approved.
Focus shifts to Modly
After the first three cases of covid-19 sailors emerged on the carrier, Crozier and his superior officers struggled to reach a consensus about what steps should be taken, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
Crozier wanted a more aggressive effort up front to protect the crew’s health, even if that meant taking near-unprecedented steps, such as a 90 percent evacuation of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier operating in the Pacific. His immediate superiors favored smaller mitigation efforts, which Crozier felt were insufficient to ensure sailors did not fall seriously ill from the virus.
The captain said the carrier could set sail immediately if it were a matter of war and would be prepared to win a conflict despite the outbreak on board. “However, we are not at war, and therefore cannot allow a single Sailor to perish as a result of this pandemic unnecessarily,” Crozier wrote.
He pointed out that it was impossible for him to follow the social distancing guidelines the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had released because of the close quarters and shared facilities for the crew aboard the carrier. Crozier noted that even crew members who tested negative for covid-19 were later showing up with symptoms, meaning the only solution was large-scale isolation.
Crozier requested the Navy provide off-ship lodging that complied with the CDC guidelines for over 4,000 sailors in his crew to isolate them and return them to the ship virus-free after a period of quarantine. In the meantime, he said the ship should be disinfected and 10 percent of the crew should remain on board to run the nuclear reactor plant, sanitize the ship and ensure security.
Ultimately, the Navy has begun a large-scale evacuation of the ship to facilities in Guam, but so far it has not been quite as extensive as Crozier suggested.
Now, the controversy has moved on from whether it was appropriate for Crozier to send his March 30 letter to whether it was appropriate for Modly to fire the captain without an investigation and subsequently visit the carrier to make disparaging remarks about him, even as Crozier battles a covid-19 diagnosis himself.
Peter Feaver, a Duke University professor who studies civilian-military relations, said Modly’s speech to sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt was ill-advised because of the possibility that it, like Crozier’s memo, could make its way into the media, and because he appeared to have spoken extemporaneously for at least part of the address, using profanity and denigrating Crozier.
“It was risky for him to go out there,” Feaver said. But if that was the decision, he said, he would have counseled the acting secretary to “stick to your talking points.”"

Lin’s case is an ominous example. We cannot punish doctors for speaking out during this pandemic. They have a perspective that we need badly now — bringing back first-person knowledge of the worst extremes of a still-building crisis.
Until recently, it was difficult for physicians to share their experiences in newspapers and other publications, unless they could contort their own perspectives into the confines of a constantly mutating news cycle. As it did to so many facets of life, the coronavirus pandemic changed that. Suddenly, news outlets are actively seeking input from physicians and nurses. It should be an ideal time for these fellows to publish and lead. And it would be, if only their employers weren’t getting in the way.
On the day that Lin said he was fired, I sent a group of doctors that I work with in my capacity as a facilitator for the OpED Project a link to a CNN form that asked clinicians to share their experiences. In less than 10 minutes, my email was met with another from a hospital administrator, saying “[The hospital] is asking that you NOT share your stories with the media per an email that went out yesterday.”
Soon after, a message arrived from the hospital’s media office explaining the prohibition: “The format that these kinds of submissions would take inherently make things look more chaotic than they actually are,” it read, adding, “We wouldn’t want to create the impression that we are detracting from patient care in order to shoot these.”
On March 11, another physician connected with my program posted an innocuous mention of a lack of tests and a picture of herself at work; the post was shared more than 1,800 times. She messaged me later saying “turned down interviews w ABC nightly news and Good morning America” because her posts had angered “some important people.” She didn’t say exactly what irked them, but the only part of her post that would have had anything to do with her employer was the fact that it didn’t have enough supplies, which aligned with Lin’s complaints.
Similar issues seem to be playing out elsewhere. Fortune magazine and Bloomberg News have both reported that NYU Langone Medical Center in New York has forbidden staff from contacting the media without permission under threat of termination. A number of physicians have complained that they can’t speak to the media for fear of being fired.
Protecting patient privacy is a must. So is treating patients; health-care providers shouldn’t prioritize media appearances over medical appointments. But after working with health-care professionals during this crisis to facilitate their inclusion in the news, I don’t think there’s much risk to privacy or patients themselves. From what I’ve witnessed in working with them, my fellows are committed professionals, and they know that, in this unprecedented crisis, patient care includes public advocacy, minus the personal details.
We need to confront what this media management is really about. Esther Choo, an emergency physician at Oregon Health and Science University, said on CNN this past weekend that much of this is simply hospitals “not wanting to be upfront about how things aren’t going well inside their walls.” That sounds a lot like an attempt at self-preservation by corporate entities.
That’s not to say that all hospitals have something to hide. Indeed, a shortage of PPE isn’t an oversight on the facility’s part; they are victims to failed leadership by the federal government. And it is true, of course, that we need clinicians doing on clinical duty, not getting ready for their close-up, though all the doctors I know put their professional responsibilities first.
But as the virus spreads, so do health-care providers’ job descriptions; they’re being asked to fill out clinical rosters in specialties they’re not used to. It’s not always clear whether this added media responsibility is one of whistleblower or citizen journalist but I don’t think that matters. All that matters is that they be allowed to do it without fear of repercussions.
For safety and privacy reasons, journalists can’t embed themselves in emergency department bays. The reporting of physicians and nurses is essential. In fact, it might be what saves us. That one Facebook post written by the doctor who declined all of those invitations to speak on national news shows convinced a local politician to activate state agencies in Massachusetts. Another published an op-ed in which he drew on his clinical experience in the hospital to explain how the United States could avoid becoming like Italy. Manufacturers and experts contacted him, inquiring how they could help. I suspect that his employer will eventually tout him as one of the heroes who helped solve the ventilator shortage, as will those of Lin and all the other physicians in the news — if they allow their employees to speak.
Not every doctor or nurse who’s had a media appearance has been quieted or threatened. But I fear that many of those who’ve been allowed to speak have been encouraged to do so out of an interest in branding, rather than from a desire to provide real information.
Some may argue that these physicians should take their lumps if they don’t follow their employers’ orders. And there’s some truth to that: When your job and health insurance are in play, sometimes it’s wise to walk a safe path. But this is not one of those times — and they shouldn’t have to put themselves in professional jeopardy to help inform us when they’re already in the line of fire. And that means it’s on their employers to let them speak up. Rendering clinicians inconsequential during a worldwide pandemic is the worst thing they can do."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/meet-dominic-raab-the-man-standing-in-for-boris-johnson/2020/04/07/75681898-7885-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,"Who is Dominic Raab, the man standing in for Boris Johnson?","LONDON — With Prime Minister Boris Johnson in an intensive care unit with covid-19, the British government and its response to the coronavirus crisis is being led by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, a Johnson loyalist with a markedly different style than his boss.
Unlike the United States, Britain does not have clear succession rules. There is no one with the title “deputy prime minister.” But even before Johnson was first taken to the hospital Sunday evening, he had nominated Raab to stand in for him if needed.
Now, that means Raab, 46, is chairing national security meetings and daily covid-19 teleconferences.
Raab is known to be extremely faithful to Johnson, which may explain why he was tapped. Even as he was assuming the leadership role, Raab was keen to stress that he would focus on implementing Johnson’s directives.
“There’s an incredibly strong team spirit behind the prime minister,” Raab told the BBC late Monday. He said that the team was “making sure that we get all of the plans the prime minister’s instructed us to deliver to get them implemented as soon as possible.”
Raab ran against Johnson in last summer’s Conservative Party leadership race, pitching himself as someone who would deliver Brexit without “bluff and bluster.” But his campaign never really took off, and after he was knocked out of the race, he moved quickly to back Johnson.
Whereas the prime minister is a flamboyant, informal, confident — some might say overconfident — politician who for years has been known to Britons on a first-name basis, Raab is “the driest Thatcherite in the Cabinet,” said Steven Fielding, a political expert at the University of Nottingham.
Fielding questioned whether Raab’s communication skills were up to the job at a moment Britain is looking for strong leadership.
“He sweats an incredible amount, and, whatever the reason, it’s not a good look if you’re looking for reassurance,” Fielding said. Raab repeatedly dabbed his face during one much-commented-on speech in 2018, when he was Britain’s Brexit secretary. “Sweaty Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab feels the heat,” ran a headline in the Daily Mail.
He has his fans, too. Stewart Jackson, a former Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday that Raab may be an “anti-Boris,” but he’s also “clever, self-assured and even tempered yet also cautious, managerial, unsentimental and taciturn.”
“It’s only in the white heat of this international crisis that the attributes of this serious and competent politician will be really tested and where Dominic Raab can and will excel,” Jackson wrote.
Raab was raised in Buckinghamshire and studied law at Oxford and then Cambridge. He has spoken movingly about his father, a Czechoslovakia-born Jewish refugee who settled in Britain in 1938 at age six. Most of his father’s family, Raab said, were “systematically murdered for no other reason than they were Jews.”
In 2010, he was elected to Parliament in an ultra-safe Conservative seat in Surrey, a county close to London where he lives with his wife and their two sons. He quickly became known as a rising star in the Conservative Party, attracting attention for his productivity, competency on foreign policy, and for writing a book, along with four other Conservative lawmakers, about their vision for the party. In 2011, he won “Newcomer of the Year” at the Spectator magazine’s parliamentary awards.
That same year, Raab clashed with Theresa May over his views on feminism — he accused feminists of “obnoxious bigotry.” Still, as prime minister in 2018, May gave him his first cabinet position.
Raab’s stint as Brexit secretary was a short one. He was widely criticized by pro-European Union figures for saying he “hadn’t quite understood” how reliant Britain’s trade was on the Dover-Calais crossing. which connects Britain to France. He resigned after four months, saying he could not support the concessions that were being made.
When Johnson became prime minister, Raab was back at the top table, this time as foreign secretary, one of the four “great offices of state.”
Fielding said many of Britain’s big decisions about its coronavirus response — the lockdown restrictions, the testing targets, the ordering of ventilators ­— had been made, and that, for the short-term, “it’s a question of making sure those decisions are applied.”
“Britain can do without a prime ministerial figure for a few days,” he said. “If it’s a question of a month, then certain decisions will have to be made.”
Michael Gove, a senior Conservative politician who some people see as Johnson’s No. 2, told ITV that decisions about lifting Britain’s social distancing restrictions would be made collectively as a cabinet, but that, ultimately, the final decision-maker was now the foreign secretary."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/07/damage-done-by-democrats-delay-relief-bill/,The Washington Post,The damage done by Democrats’ delay on the relief bill,"Want to see the damage done by the Democrats’ week-long delay in passing the emergency relief bill? Consider the bill’s most important employment provision, the Paycheck Protection Program — a $350 billion fund to provide small businesses with “forgivable loans” so they can keep the lights on during the lockdown and avoid laying off their workers.
According to a survey published the week after the bill was passed, a quarter of small businesses reported that they had already been forced to temporarily close, and 40 percent of those left said they were on the verge of closing within two weeks. That is more than half of all small businesses in the United States.
This is why it was critical to get these businesses help fast. The desperation for help was evident in the rush for loans Friday, when the Paycheck Protection Program finally came online, a week after President Trump signed the bill into law. On its first day alone, banks approved about 17,500 loans valued at over $5.4 billion. By Tuesday, the program had funded 178,000 loans at a value of $50 billion. The demand is so great that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced he would seek to approve more funding to prevent the program from running out of money.
Had Senate Democrats not filibustered the bill, the program would have been in place a week sooner. On March 26 we learned that a record 3.28 million Americans had filed for unemployment insurance the week before. That record was quickly shattered when we found out an additional 6.6 million joined the unemployment rolls the week Democrats were filibustering — for a total of nearly 10 million. Every day, every hour that Congress delayed, more businesses shut their doors, and more Americans lost their jobs.
Not only did Democrats delay the bill, but they also used that delay as leverage to make unemployment benefits so generous that in many cases unemployment is now more attractive than a paycheck. The bill increases unemployment benefits by $600 per week for four months — twice as long as the two months the Paycheck Protection Program benefits are supposed to last. Depending on which state workers are in, this is the equivalent of $15 to $35 an hour for not working.
Benefits that generous will draw people onto unemployment who might otherwise not be there. It will make it harder for the businesses that are hiring during the lockdown — such as supermarkets, pharmacies, online retailers and delivery services — to find workers. And if we lift restrictions on economic activity in fewer than four months’ (as we all hope is the case), fragile small businesses trying to restart operations will have to compete with the unemployment office for employees.
All of this undermines the bill’s objective of a “V-shaped” recovery — a steep, rapid decline, followed by an equally steep, rapid economic resurgence once the danger from the virus has been mitigated. There is still good reason to hope this can happen. We don’t have the structural problems of the 2008 financial crisis; before the virus hit, the fundamentals of the economy were strong. And unlike a hurricane or an earthquake, a virus does not wipe out critical infrastructure that takes years to rebuild. That means, as soon the quarantines and social distancing stop, our economy could come roaring back, perhaps as soon as this summer.
But for that to happen, we must keep workers employed, so that we have a workforce in place and ready go as soon as the restrictions are lifted. The more workers who lose their jobs and end up on unemployment during the lockdown, the less likely a rapid resurgence becomes — because it will take time for businesses to find new workers, and for workers to find new jobs.
To rescue the U.S. economy, we must flatten the unemployment curve at the same time we flatten the coronavirus curve. That was the purpose of the economic recovery bill. There is a simple way to measure whether it is succeeding: Do unemployment claims stop rising? If they don’t, then we will know the help came too late — and was structured the wrong way."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/07/trumps-purge-is-about-get-much-worse-schiff-just-sent-up-flare/,The Washington Post,Trump’s purge is about to get much worse. Schiff just sent up a flare.,"After President Trump fired the inspector general of the intelligence community, he didn’t bother disguising his true reason for doing so: because that IG had conducted his lawful duties in a manner that resulted in Trump being held accountable for his misdeeds and corruption.
As Trump himself put it, Michael Atkinson, the fired IG, had done a “terrible job.” How so? Easy: Atkinson had evaluated the whistleblower complaint exposing Trump’s Ukraine shakedown scheme with procedural correctness.
“He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress,” Trump said. That’s what Atkinson was supposed to do, and the complaint turned out to be almost entirely accurate, leading to Trump getting justly impeached over the extraordinary misconduct that came out as a result.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) just announced that the House Intelligence Committee, which he chairs, will be examining Trump’s firing of Atkinson. And buried in Schiff’s letter making this announcement is an unsettling glimpse of where all this could be going.
Schiff’s letter, which is addressed to acting director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, expresses Schiff’s concern that Grenell is politicizing that office on Trump’s behalf, noting that every Senate-confirmed person in the DNI has been removed.
Schiff’s letter argues that Atkinson “acted with the highest integrity and remarkable professionalism,” while being subjected to a campaign of attacks by Trump and his allies simply for adhering to his oath of office.
Notably, in the section announcing the investigation of Atkinson’s dismissal, Schiff calls on Grenell to confirm in writing whether he ever exercised his “authority” to “prohibit” any other “investigation, inspection, audit, or review” that Atkinson might have undertaken.
Schiff’s letter also calls on Grenell to stipulate in writing that he “will not permit retaliation or reprisals against anyone who has made, or in the future makes, protected disclosures of misconduct.”
Who might make such reprisals against such protected disclosures? Why, one Donald J. Trump, of course.
Those are very suggestive moves by Schiff. They in effect throw down the gauntlet and challenge Grenell not to stipulate to those things.
Ned Price, a former senior National Security Council official and CIA analyst, told me that if Grenell refuses to make these stipulations — which is plausible if not likely — it will underscore how abnormal this administration truly is.
“His decision not to answer would be incredibly telling,” Price said.
Price added that a failure on Grenell’s part to state that he hadn’t interfered in any other ongoing investigations, or a refusal to pledge to defend employees in the future, might signal a willingness to allow Trump to proceed with a “campaign of retaliation.”
This a reasonable concern because there already is such a campaign of retaliation. As noted above, Trump blithely admitted that’s why he fired Atkinson.
Trump also cheerfully revealed that he removed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a leading impeachment witness, for being “insubordinate” when he “reported” on Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president. In other words, Vindman disloyally told the truth about Trump’s corruption.
Meanwhile, Trump just raged at another inspector general for reporting that numerous hospitals around the country badly need medical supplies to save U.S. lives — the heresy here being that this revealed Trump’s monumental failures on coronavirus.
Price noted that if all of this continues, as it almost surely will, one possible worst-case scenario might be that we could see an effort to ferret out the whistleblower himself. “This would be a huge red line,” Price said, and a signal that Trump “feels no limits whatsoever.”
Another reasonable possibility, Price suggested, might be stepped-up retaliation against career analysts who concluded that Russia had interfered in the last election on Trump’s behalf. Price said this would have the “ultimate chilling effect for the intelligence community,” which would be particularly worrisome at a time when Russia is expected to interfere again on Trump’s behalf.
It’s worth stressing that Trump’s purging isn’t just retaliatory, it’s forward-looking, too. By removing officials who committed the sin of trying to defend the rule of law from his efforts to corrupt it, Trump sends a message to others about what awaits them if they try to stand in the way.
Now, maybe none of this will happen. But if Grenell does decline to stipulate to those things, we will have been placed on clear notice that the purging will probably get much, much worse."

Council freezes rent hikes but omits undocumented immigrants from covid-19 relief bill,"The D.C. Council on Tuesday passed sweeping coronavirus relief legislation that freezes rent increases and makes it easier for inmates to win early release.
City leaders also promised to offer assistance to undocumented residents, who do not qualify for unemployment insurance or stimulus checks, after dropping provisions meant to help them.
The council unanimously passed the emergency measures during the body’s first virtual legislative session, with lawmakers calling in from home using Zoom, a teleconferencing program.
“We are dealing with an uncertain future,” Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said. “We’ve shut down our economy, there’s a lot of uncertainty, and there are a lot of folks in the community looking for different ways we can help now and minimize what the adverse impacts are.”
Schools, nonessential businesses and parks are closed in the District through the end of the month and possibly longer, with the city projecting an early summer peak in covid-19 hospitalizations.
The latest relief legislation, which will take effect immediately when Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) signs it, allows the mayor to extend the public health emergency and the accompanying restrictions through mid-June if necessary.
It also includes measures to protect residents from further financial strain as jobless claims soar, many relating to housing.
Landlords in both rent-controlled and market-rate buildings cannot increase rents while the public health emergency is in effect. And tenants who gave notice to vacate their units can stay until the mayor lifts the emergency declaration.
Local mortgage lenders must also allow borrowers to defer mortgage payments for 90 days without late fees if they can demonstrate financial hardship because of covid-19. The provision applies to locally regulated lenders, which does not include major national banks.
Residential tenants can request rent deferrals if their landlord is able to defer their mortgage, and commercial tenants, such as restaurants that have shut down, must see reduced or deferred rents.
“If you can’t pay your rent, then we want you to be able to benefit as well,” council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) said.
Officials also added cable television, Internet and phone service to the utilities that can’t be shut off. A late amendment requested by the mayor’s office would allow Internet providers to shift customers to a lower-tier plan for nonpayment, as long as basic service is maintained.
The District had already halted evictions and power shut-offs under earlier relief legislation.
The bill also relaxes graduation eligibility rules for high school seniors, removing requirements for a set time of classroom instruction and 100 hours of community service.
“This legislation ensures that our high school students’ futures are not put on hold because of the ongoing public health emergency,” said David Grosso (I-At Large), who chairs the education committee.
D.C. residents incarcerated at the jail and at federal prisons would also have more options for early release under the legislation, provided that officials find that the release would not endanger public safety.
The bill expands “good time” credits for those incarcerated for offenses before 2000 and the criteria for allowing prisoners to request an early “compassionate” release. Inmates older than 60 or who have terminal illnesses or chronic medical conditions that place them at a greater risk of succumbing to covid-19 may file motions for early release.
“The failure to contain the virus on the inside for whatever reason will accelerate its proliferation on the outside,” said Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), who chairs the public safety committee.
Activists and lawmakers raised an uproar after Bowser and Mendelson dropped provisions to provide direct cash assistance and a separate unemployment insurance program for immigrants, citing concerns over costs.
“Those discussions are ongoing, looking at alternatives for how we can find dollars and provide some assistance to undocumented workers, so that issue is not being ignored,” Mendelson said.
Undocumented immigrants and workers who rely on nontraditional streams of income, including street vending, housekeeping, babysitting and other jobs that pay in cash, may struggle to meet unemployment requirements such as providing pay stubs or a social security number, activists said.
Already, organizations like Mary’s Center, a health clinic, and Many Languages One Voice, which works with immigrant communities, have received countless pleas for help from D.C. residents who worry that they will not be able to pay rent or feed their families in coming weeks.
“We don’t have money to pay for the rent or lights or gas,” Reina Sosa, a street vendor who earns her living selling mangoes, watermelon and taquitos near the Columbia Heights Metro station, said in Spanish.
She and other vendors have shut down their operations because of the public health crisis and orders from the D.C. government to close all nonessential businesses.
Other municipalities in the region have designated a relief fund for workers in the cash economy. Earlier this month, Montgomery County put aside $5 million for direct relief to “residents facing hardship” in a relief bill passed by the county council.
D.C. activists have called on the District to do the same — $5 million for families in need.
“It would be a lifeline for people who are being locked out of the unemployment system,” said Elizabeth Falcon, the executive director of D.C. Jobs With Justice, a workers’ rights organization.
Following the surprise removal of the cash-assistance provision from the council’s legislation last week, D.C. Jobs With Justice organized a letter-writing campaign demanding that the provision be reinstated. As of Tuesday’s vote, more than 830 letters had been sent.
“These ‘excluded workers’ include tens of thousands of immigrant families and other workers,” the letter states. “These people make D.C. work, but their work is sometimes invisible. They care for children and grandparents so others can go out of the home to work, they clean hotel rooms to make our hospitality sector strong, they power our new development by constructing our buildings, they keep our offices clean overnight, they wash dishes and keep bars stocked so we can enjoy our cocktails and D.C.’s fine dining.”
Other provisions in the D.C. emergency legislation prohibit debt collectors from contacting or initiating actions against debtors until 60 days after the public health emergency ends and requires the D.C. Board of Elections to mail absentee ballot applications and return envelopes with prepaid postage to all voters.
The legislation also authorizes the short-term borrowing of up to $500 million to manage the city’s cash flow while sales tax revenue is down and reserves are being tapped.
Before the final vote, Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) urged his colleagues not to shirk their oversight duty during the emergency.
“We can’t be caught flat-footed after the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of many, many months,” White said.
Some provisions also acknowledge the grim reality of a rising covid-19 death toll.
Funeral home operators must post a “funeral bill of rights” and casket pricing on premises.

In a real sense, however, the action speaks for itself. It sends a clear, and troubling, signal that Mr. Trump wants to influence the direction of a body that was supposed to scrutinize, on behalf of taxpayers, more than $2 trillion in new federal commitments to fight coronavirus spread and its economic consequences. As such, it delivered a blow to the committee’s independence even before it started working in earnest.
It’s important to understand how we got here. By signing the $2.2 trillion Cares Act, Mr. Trump explicitly accepted an extensively negotiated bipartisan agreement to subject this extraordinary flow of funds to commensurate oversight. The president gets to appoint a special inspector general for $500 billion in resources assigned to the Treasury Department; Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate appoint a congressional oversight commission for both Treasury and the Federal Reserve; and there is the PRAC, composed of inspectors general drawn from all government agencies with wide-ranging powers to supervise all agencies. The government’s highest-ranking inspector general, Michael Horowitz of the Justice Department, chose Mr. Fine, a highly respected former Justice Department inspector general serving as acting IG of the Defense Department, to run the PRAC. Mr. Trump did not technically fire Mr. Fine from the PRAC, but rather replaced him at the Pentagon, which, under the applicable law, disqualified him from the PRAC.
This was not the action of a president concerned with carrying out the commitment to transparency that he had agreed to in negotiating the bill. Nor was the move clearly connected to the finer-grained constitutional concerns about the executive director appointment process Mr. Trump had raised upon signing it. It was, however, consistent with Mr. Trump’s disdain for government watchdogs generally, manifest in recent days through his dismissal of the intelligence community’s IG, in apparent retaliation for supporting the whistleblower in the Ukraine aid scandal, and through his characterization of the Health and Human Services IG’s critical report on pandemic response as a “fake dossier.”
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Mr. Trump has something to fear from good-faith independent examination of the agencies under his administration. Another president might consider aggressive oversight of the Cares Act programs as the price of public support for the vast and intrusive expenditures to come. There is an inevitable trade-off between saving the economy, which requires that resources get spent fast, and the need to minimize waste and fraud, which are bound to increase with the pace of spending. The best way to handle this trade-off is to put bureaucrats and business executives on notice that they may be answerable for their conduct at some later date. This is the deterrent function the Cares Act’s oversight provisions were designed to perform, and which Mr. Trump has just undermined."

Critics often describe Trump as disruptive, erratic and poorly focused. But in concentrating on these weaknesses, opponents understate Trump’s success in using power aggressively to reward his friends and hurt his enemies, perhaps more than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson.
Trump is even gutting the monitors who are providing accountability for the spending programs to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus. His latest move came Tuesday, when he sacked Glenn Fine, the acting Pentagon inspector general who had been chosen by his fellow IGs to lead a panel overseeing the $2 trillion pandemic bailout effort.
Trump’s campaign against accountability has been especially heavy-handed with the intelligence community. That culminated in Friday’s dismissal of Michael Atkinson, a highly regarded government career attorney who since 2018 had served as watchdog of the 17 agencies that report to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).
Trump’s curt dismissal letter Friday said he lacked “the fullest confidence” in Atkinson. Trump didn’t explain his reasons for firing him, but Atkinson said later that he was ousted as revenge for “having faithfully discharged my legal obligations” in supporting a whistleblower’s charges about Ukraine that eventually led to Trump’s impeachment.
With Atkinson’s dismissal, Trump has replaced every experienced, Senate-confirmed official at the ODNI. Intelligence is now overseen by acting director Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist and former State Department spokesman.
These dizzying changes have startled key members of Congress. Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told me Tuesday that “both Republicans and Democrats on the . . . committee are united in our concern about the politicization of intelligence.” Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told me he thought Trump was seeking to “chill dissent and neuter any oversight of his conduct.”
The makeover at the ODNI is part of a broader degradation of accountability and oversight mechanisms across government. One little-noted facilitator of this demolition process is the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). Once a respected source of legal guidance, the OLC has become a reliably pro-Trump advocate under Attorney General William P. Barr and the OLC chief, Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel.
In an OLC opinion in September that astonished many Justice Department veterans, Engel argued that the DNI’s office couldn’t transmit to Congress the Ukraine whistleblower’s compliant. Engel opined that the complaint wasn’t an “urgent concern” as defined by law. Atkinson responded with a blistering letter, and the administration eventually relented.
Engel’s other controversial OLC opinions include a ruling in June that Trump didn’t need to release his tax returns and an opinion in May that White House advisers had “absolute immunity” from testifying in the impeachment inquiry.
An invidious part of Trump’s campaign is his attempt to undermine the inspector general system itself. These officials serve in 73 agencies across the government and are supposed to provide independent, nonpartisan reporting of abuses to Congress and the executive branch. Fourteen IG positions are vacant, including those at the CIA, Defense, Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services.
On Friday, Trump nominated officials to fill five of these open positions, but many of his nominees have administration political ties. For example, Brian Miller, his choice for a special inspector general post to audit the pandemic recovery program, serves in the White House counsel’s office and helped manage document releases during the impeachment probe. He also formerly served as inspector general at the General Services Administration.
Peter M. Thomson, nominated to be the CIA inspector general, is a former prosecutor who in his recent private practice, among various white-collar defense work, “defends owners, operators and crew members of motor vessels who have been charged with environmental crimes,” according to his firm’s website. He’s a regular contributor to the blog of the conservative Federalist Society.
Perhaps the most shocking attack on oversight was Trump’s denunciation of HHS Deputy Inspector General Christi Grimm. A 20-year veteran of her agency’s IG office, Grimm helped prepare a survey of 323 hospitals dealing with the covid-19 pandemic. An April 3 IG statement said the hospitals reported “severe shortages of testing supplies and extended waits for test results” and “widespread shortages of personal protective equipment [that] put staff and patients at risk.”
Trump blasted Grimm on Monday and said the 46-state survey of hospitals “could be her opinion.” In a tweet Tuesday, he questioned whether she had audited Obama administration anti-flu efforts and concluded: “Another Fake Dossier!”"

Voters in Milwaukee, the state’s Democratic stronghold and the center of its coronavirus outbreak, saw their available polling places drop from 180 to just five, as polling workers — many in an older, high-risk demographic — stayed away. In consequence, lines snaked for blocks, with waits reported to be up to three hours long. Meanwhile, voters in Republican-leaning areas of the state reportedly had a far easier time.
Yet, understandably, plenty of people chose not to vote, despite having voted regularly for years. These abstainers do not deserve scorn for listening to the warnings of public health officials. The blame lies with the state leaders who put them in this impossible position: state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) and state Senate Republican leader Scott L. Fitzgerald.
Mr. Vos and Mr. Fitzgerald refused to move the election date or even to make it slightly easier for people to vote safely — by mail, for example — as Gov. Tony Evers (D) pleaded with them to do. As state election officials were swamped with absentee ballot requests they could not fill before Tuesday, Republicans litigated all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to insist that any mail-in ballots not postmarked by Tuesday be thrown out — even for voters to whom state workers could not send ballots on time.

A 5-to-4 conservative majority on Monday gave the Republicans what they wanted, reasoning that judges should not relax deadlines or make any other last-minute changes to voting rules. That was the wrong call. When people are in line at a polling place at closing time, judges order the polls to stay open. It should have been the same for people who got in line properly for an absentee ballot. The conservative justices’ lack of concern for these thousands of voters will only encourage speculation that their motivation was partisan.
The motivations of Mr. Vos and Mr. Fitzgerald require little speculation. The marquee race in Wisconsin on Tuesday was not the Democratic presidential primary but the retention election for a highly conservative state Supreme Court justice, a race in which Wisconsin Republicans have a large stake. Before Tuesday’s election, Republican state lawmakers had already imposed an extremely gerrymandered legislative district map on Wisconsin, mandated strict voter-ID requirements and stripped powers from Mr. Evers. Forcing voters to make a potentially deadly decision about whether to show up, thereby discouraging turnout, was yet another move in their bare-knuckle fight to hold on to power, even at the expense of democracy."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-judge-expands-voting-decision-to-apply-to-all-ex-felons-in-florida/2020/04/07/135d2200-7917-11ea-a130-df573469f094_story.html,The Washington Post,Federal judge expands voting decision to apply to all ex-felons in Florida,"The federal judge overseeing the ongoing dispute between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and released felons who want to vote handed the Republican governor another defeat Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle said a previous ruling he made that allowed felons to vote, even if they owe fines and fees stemming from their convictions, covers all individuals statewide, not just the 17 people who originally sued DeSantis.
Tuesday’s order applies to an estimated 1.4 million men and women. Though Florida voters in 2018 overwhelmingly passed an amendment to the state’s constitution to allow automatic restoration of voting rights after prison, Republican lawmakers have sought to impose requirements that would block many from registering.
“This is huge. It’s a game-changer,” said Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. A federal trial on the issue is scheduled for this month.
The Florida secretary of state’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Voting rights activists have criticized Republican elected officials for tinkering with what’s known as Amendment 4. Last year, the GOP-controlled legislature passed a bill that said paying fines and fees was part of serving a sentence and that anybody who owed money to the courts had to pay up before they could vote. DeSantis signed the measure into law, denying that it was discriminatory.
Court clerks across the state say fines owed by former felons who have completed their sentences and are on probation total more than $1 billion. The average amount owed is estimated to be $1,500, according to the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition.
The requirement that citizens pay a fine before they can register to vote amounts to an illegal poll tax, critics of the legislation say.
In his ruling, Hinkle cited a woman who said she’s trying to pay her fines but “based on her income will not be able to pay off her financial obligations until 2031.”
“Many thousands of felons are unable to pay their relevant financial obligations because of indigency,” Hinkle noted. “Still others are unable to pay because the amount owed is out of reach even for a person who is not indigent.”
In October, Hinkle ruled in favor of the 17 plaintiffs. The state appealed that decision, but it was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. Judges in that decision said the state “may not erect a wealth barrier” to citizens who want to register to vote.
During a hearing last week — held via teleconference because of coronavirus considerations — Hinkle grew impatient with DeSantis representatives because they had not yet come up with a plan to let released felons know whether they owe any money before they can register.
“If the state is not going to fix it, I will,” Hinkle said.
His order Tuesday reiterated that. “The state’s records of financial obligations are a mess,” Hinkle wrote.
Volz said his group is “optimistic and encouraged” by the ruling. Ultimately, the case’s impact in this crucial battleground state could be significant in November’s presidential election.
Desmond Meade, executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, called it a major victory.
“We are pleased that the court appears to be consistent in placing people over politics,” Meade said."

The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex rose 9%, the most since May 2009, while the NSE Nifty 50 Index advanced by a similar amount. China said it didn’t have any new deaths for the first time since the pandemic emerged, while New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the virus-related fatality rate was effectively flat for two days.
“We are drawing cues from the global markets where the pace of new cases has reduced and the worst appears to have been factored in,” said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Mumbai-based Samco Securities Ltd. “There is also the possibility of government stimulus for sectors.”
The infection curve has yet to flatten in India, however. A total of 4,778 people in India have been infected with 136 deaths, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. The nation is also seeing a sharp uptick in infected cases as the administration ramps up daily testing. A lock-down through April 14 was imposed to try prevent transmission of the virus in the world’s second most populous country.
“Market participants are now focusing on the peak of the pandemic even as economic conditions have worsened,” said Chokkalingam G, head of investment advisory at Equinomics Research & Advisory Pvt. in Mumbai. “A three-week lockdown means no business activity for a quarter of a three-month period, which will have a substantial impact on earnings.”
Trading volumes have fallen and volatility remains high with most dealers working from home with limited flexibility. The Nifty index closed at 8792.2 on Tuesday and Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at IIFL Securities Ltd., said more positive news on the domestic front regarding the virus is needed for the gauge to surge past the 9,000 level.
Sovereign bonds were lower as states ramped up debt supply during the week. The benchmark 10-year bond yield was up 11 basis points to 6.42%. The rupee advanced 0.7% against the dollar.
Bond and currency markets today begin reduced trading hours from between 10 a.m.-2 p.m. in Mumbai until April 17 due to market volatility, the Reserve Bank of India said last week.
Lockdown Stress
The disruption has already beginning to show signs of pain. Lender Bajaj Finance Ltd., said in an analyst call on Monday that the company has lost 47.5 billion rupees ($625 million) in assets under management in the last 10 days, BloombergQuint said in a report. The firm also said that small and medium -sized businesses were under severe strain and asked the central bank to consider further economic relief measures, according to the report.
Companies will start announcing their results for the January-March quarter this month. Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 14% decline in profits for the companies under its coverage with a double-digit drop in net income for sectors like autos and construction material as economic activities suffered in March."

In overwhelmed emergency rooms, they’re joining forces with health-care workers returning from retirement, and those practicing outside their specialties. New York may be a preview of what is to come in hot spots across the country. This migration of health-care workers emphasizes that we need to prepare for more than shortages in vital supplies such as ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE). We need to be ready for shortages in people.
As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) urges health-care workers to help meet the surge in New York, governors across the country are preparing for their own crises by slashing red tape. Since medical licenses are regulated mostly at the state level, it’s largely up to states to eliminate regulatory hurdles for qualified medical professionals to be able to offer their talents in an emergency. Most states have relaxed medical license regulations by granting temporary licenses to out-of-state physicians, waiving licensing fees or activating interstate compact laws that can expedite medical licensing between states. Some states are temporarily licensing doctors who are licensed and in good standing in foreign countries. All states should streamline the temporary licensing process as much as possible. States should also take steps recommended by the National Governors Association and the Department of Health and Human Services, such as providing emergency child care for health-care workers, clearing the way for telemedicine and ensuring that students training to join the health-care workforce can stay on track.
All these are important measures to try to keep our hospitals afloat. But hospitals depend on more than doctors and nurses. Other vital providers include physician assistants, pharmacists and first responders. Respiratory therapists are especially crucial right now. There was a shortage even before the pandemic, and their work with patients’ lungs now puts them at higher risk.
Perhaps least appreciated are those not directly involved in clinical care but whose work ensures that hospitals remain clean, safe and efficient. Environmental service workers who take patients their meals, clean linens and operating rooms, and staff hospital cafeterias make far less money than physicians and are least likely to be prioritized for PPE. Like medical professionals, they risk their well-being just by showing up to work these days. They often possess specialized knowledge that makes them less replaceable than one might assume — custodial workers in hospitals, for example, must follow specific sanitation protocols to ensure patients’ safety.
“Stay home for us while we go to work for you,” health-care workers urge. That is the least we can do. We should do even more to support our hospitals: find better child-care solutions for workers, provide all workers with PPE, and make sure our formal and informal efforts remember all the people going to work for us — even the ones we don’t always recognize."

Trump heralded their plans as he hosted a video conference with leaders of banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
“We really appreciate what you’re doing,” Trump said. “I hope the media here can see what an incredible job the banks have done.”
The participants, top executives from the five biggest U.S. banks and two largest payment networks, touted their efforts to help affected businesses and consumers -- pointing to capital devoted to small business loans, an assortment of waived fees, and loans and grants to community development financial institutions.
Goldman Sachs is planning to double its balance sheet capital available to small businesses to $500 million, CEO David Solomon said. The move is in addition to $25 million for a relief fund and $25 million in grants to community development financial institutions.
The participants have also been helping the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration distribute $349 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, part of the $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at shoring up an economy battered by the pandemic. It offers loans of as much $10 million that are forgivable if firms use the funds mostly to keep workers on their payrolls for the next two months and for expenses such as rent.
Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said his firm has gotten 250,000 applications that it’s beginning to process, and continues “to get several thousand applications every hour.” JPMorgan Co-President Gordon Smith said the largest U.S. lender had gotten 375,000 requests as of Tuesday afternoon, amounting to roughly $40 billion in loans.
Trump announced that as of Tuesday, the SBA has processed more than $70 billion in guaranteed loans from more than 225,000 business that have applied. That amount hasn’t been given to firms yet, but rather is the value of loans SBA has registered and guaranteed for lenders to complete the process and disburse funds, according to a senior administration official.
That would mean about 20% of the $349 billion appropriated for the program has already been committed. The Treasury Department is asking Congress for $250 billion more for the program, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate could act as soon as this week to pass additional money.
Trump said the program has been rolled out with only a few “glitches,” but there’s been reports of widespread problems and confusion since it launched Friday. Lenders have complained about not being able to connect with SBA to process loans, and there were reports on Monday that E-Tran, the SBA system that lenders use, crashed.
Lenders reported that the system was working on Tuesday, but applications were trickling through, and the ability of lenders to connect with SBA to get loans approved and for non-SBA lenders to get approved was “a little bit spotty,” said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America in an interview before the briefing.
Noah Wilcox, chairman of Grand Rapids State Bank of Minnesota and chairman of the ICBA, complained during the Trump briefing that many community banks aren’t able to participate in the program because they aren’t approved SBA lenders. The SBA plans to certify more to participate.
“We know from an informal survey that about one-third of all community banks still do not have access to the system, and that means those community banks have been boxed out, and unable to serve their communities and their customers,” Wilcox told Trump during the meeting."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesco-has-every-right-to-pay-a-dividend/2020/04/08/96fd7a0a-7990-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,Tesco Has Every Right to Pay a Dividend,"One well-known British retailer says it has noticed a marked upturn in customers saying “Thank you” to store staff since the start of the Covid-19 crisis. Investors in another — Tesco Plc — will be doing the same after it said it would pay out 635 million pounds ($783 million) in final dividends, taking its distribution for the full year to about 900 million pounds.
Britain’s biggest retailer has every right to reward its shareholders. After all, unlike many companies crippled by the virus lockdown, it is doing well. The supermarket operator has come through the dark days of 2014 when it discovered a 250 million-pound profit shortfall, and made one of the biggest losses in British corporate history.
Tesco on Wednesday announced underlying operating profit of just below 3 billion pounds in the year to Feb. 29, 2020, and said it generated just over 2 billion pounds of free cash flow. Net debt, including lease liabilities, has come down from 22 billion pounds as of February 2015 to 12.1 billion pounds. That means it has no immediate need for extra cash, capital or liquidity.
The rub is that Tesco is accepting coronavirus-related relief from the government in terms of the 12-month holiday from business rates to the tune of 585 million pounds. This is the property-based tax that Tesco Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis and others have argued unfairly penalizes retailers with big store estates, and lets online competitors get off lightly.
Across Europe, companies have been under pressure to scrap payouts in order to preserve cash or in some cases to access government aid. More than a sixth of firms in the benchmark Stoxx 600 Index have canceled or delayed dividends.
Tesco says any saving from the U.K.’s business rates will be outstripped by the extra costs it will incur to keep its stores open and treat employees well throughout the pandemic. It predicts that they will ring in at a minimum of 650 million pounds, or as much as a worst case scenario of 925 million pounds of additional expense.
This includes everything from providing full pay to sick employees, paying staff a 10% bonus, recruiting 45,000 new workers and transferring others to where they’re needed most, as well as making changes to stores, such as installing screens to protect cashiers working the check out lanes. Extra labor costs in stores and distribution centers will account for between 415 million and 580 million pounds.
So far, Tesco hasn’t accessed any other government support. It has continued to pay its VAT bill for example.
And panic-buying ahead of the U.K.’s lockdown hasn’t benefited all of its aisles. While Tesco has enjoyed an uplift in food sales, which rose about 30% in the first few weeks of the crisis, clothing and fuel sales are down about 70%. Within Tesco stores, food is notoriously low margin. The drop in demand for higher-margin furnishings and fashions, together with the higher costs, will have an impact on profit in this fiscal year.
Tesco says that as well as its staff, it is thinking about its investors — and there is likely to be some significant overlap between the two. For several years after Tesco’s own crisis, its shareholders lived without a payout. The company has been gradually rebuilding its dividend since February 2018.
The trouble is, consumer groups’ reputations will live or die by their response to Covid-19, and Tesco could have handled this differently.
One option would have been to simply defer the dividend. It could have been distributed at Tesco’s interim results in October, when feelings may not be running so high, or paid as a special dividend in 2021. After all, shareholders are already set to receive an exceptional dividend of 5 billion pounds from the sale the group’s Thai business, which it still expects to complete in the second half of this year.
Tesco, along with Britain’s other big grocers, have done an admirable job in continuing to supply food, but also absorbing workers who have been laid off from other industries. It would be a shame if this was overshadowed by the dividend decision.
A little more imaginative thinking from the Tesco board could have enabled both customers and shareholders to say, “Thank you.”"
"April 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/08/sanders-is-out-insincere-praise-begins/,The Washington Post,Bernie Sanders is out. And the insincere praise begins.,"Quite belatedly, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced Wednesday that he is ending his presidential campaign. The race was effectively over on Super Tuesday, but Sanders and his devoted Bernie Bros are not known for their selfless devotion to party, so his futile race dragged on for another month. Perhaps he stayed in an attempt to increase Democratic turnout in Wisconsin to help oust a right-wing state supreme court justice. Or maybe he would have stayed in even longer, but the sight of people endangering themselves to vote during a pandemic was simply too much to bear. In any case, his second run — far less effective than his first — is over.
Democrats, aided by the mainstream media, are now putting out two rather disingenuous storylines. First, “No one ever changed the party as much as Sanders.” Second, “Now begins the struggle to win over the Bernie Bros.” It is understandable that some Democrats — eager to avoid a schism similar to that which occurred in 2016 — are falling over themselves to assuage Sanders’s ego, but let’s not get carried away.
The “Bernie changed the party” line suggests that the party did not overwhelmingly choose a center-left successor to President Barack Obama. But it did! And it has rallied around someone who rejected Medicare-for-all, a wealth tax, left-wing isolationism and the entire “capitalism is evil” stance. Sanders got beaten badly week after week, never changing his message. That message simply did not register with more than about 30 percent of the party. Twitter does not represent the party. The party did not shift far left, as many in the media predicted (egged on by the loudest voices on the left). If anything, Biden’s wins show that the heart of the party rests with moderate African Americans — to whom all Americans are indebted for lifting a viable, electable nominee to oust President Trump. Sanders’s “movement” is far smaller than he would have liked us to believe.
As for winning over his followers, consider a recent poll showing that about 15 percent of Sanders’s supporters intend to vote for Trump if Biden is the nominee. It is hard to fathom the mindset of someone who would prefer an unfit narcissist who opposes virtually every principle and value Democrats hold dear to Obama’s vice president. It is of a piece with those who preferred Jill Stein in 2016. There is no reaching such people. Soliciting them is a waste of time.
The rest of the Sanders coalition should not need much courting. They’ve already signaled they will line up behind Biden and have expressed their determination to oust Trump. Other than not gratuitously attacking them, no great effort should be required to keep them in the fold. (Ironically, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been far more successful in advancing progressive policy ideas with Biden, including her plans on student debt forgiveness and bankruptcy.)
There are far bigger challenges for Biden than securing former Sanders voters. He must defeat Republican attempts to suppress the vote (including the GOP’s opposition to voting by mail, which forces voters to choose between their right to vote and risking their lives by voting in person during a pandemic). He must hold Trump to account for his grotesque negligence in responding to the coronavirus, the greatest failure in presidential leadership, and for his stomach-turning corruption. And he must underscore the fundamental difference in values between the parties: Democrats are defenders of the little guy and of reforms that increase their pay, protect their health care and keep them safe.
That’s a tall order, which makes it all the more urgent that Biden not be sidetracked by Bernie Bros’ hurt feelings. There is an election to be won and a country to be saved."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/08/11-most-logical-picks-joe-bidens-vice-president-ranked/,The Washington Post,"The 11 most logical picks for Joe Biden’s vice president, ranked","Joe Biden is now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, after Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign Wednesday morning.
The next big question in the race — beyond when and how Biden will be formally nominated amid a pandemic, of course — is who is going to fill out the ticket as Biden’s vice presidential running mate. The pick carries unusual importance, especially given Biden, who will turn 78 shortly after Election Day, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.
We already know one thing about that pick: It will be a woman, as Biden pledged in a recent debate.
Below is a ranking of who makes the most sense to be that running mate.
11. Susan E. Rice: This may be the most outside-the-box name on this list, but she’s got the résumé: She served on the National Security Council and in a high-ranking State Department role in the Clinton administration, and she was United Nations ambassador and national security adviser in the Obama administration. She’s also an African American woman and has recently shown an interest in elective politics, considering a run against Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) this year. The one most obvious drawback here: She was in line to possibly become President Barack Obama’s secretary of state but withdrew after the Benghazi, Libya, attack threatened to make her confirmation “lengthy, disruptive and costly,” in her words. She had come under sharp criticism for being misleading about the nature of that attack. That may not be a dealbreaker, but her public pronouncements turned her into a lightning rod, and Republicans would be happy to make Benghazi an issue again.
10. Michelle Lujan Grisham: The New Mexico governor won’t be a familiar name to many who follow national politics, nor is her state a battleground. But she’s among the relatively few Hispanic women who currently serve in high office in the United States. A former House member and chairwoman of the congressional Hispanic caucus, she comes from a famous political family in New Mexico that includes a former Cabinet official on the George H.W. Bush administration and a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court.
9. Stacey Abrams: Abrams remains a popular pick on these kinds of lists, given she ran a strong campaign for Georgia governor in 2018. But she’s still someone who hasn’t served in any office beyond the state legislature. It also may be tempting for Biden to pick her in hopes of putting an increasingly purple state in-play — and some polls have suggested that’s not totally outside the realm of possibility — but you do wonder how much of a priority that will be, ahead of more-competitive states.
8. Tammy Duckworth: The senator from Illinois arguably checks more boxes when it comes to her profile than anyone on this list. She’s a senator and former member of the House. She’s a Purple Heart recipient who lost both of her legs in Iraq and was the first disabled woman elected to Congress. She also in 2018 became the first senator to give birth while in office. And she’s got a diverse background as the daughter of a Thai mother of Chinese descent. One thing I often think about, though, is her electoral history. She was one of the most hyped Democratic House candidates in the 2006 election but lost in a good Democratic year (albeit in a tough district). She was later elected to the House in 2012 and the Senate in 2016, defeating Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.).
7. Val Demings: The only House member on this list, she got her first taste of the national spotlight when she served as one of the House impeachment managers. She’s also an African American and former police chief of a major city, Orlando. Like Duckworth in 2006, though, she was a much-hyped House candidate in the 2012 election and lost. She went on to run for mayor of Orange County, Fla., but dropped out in 2015. She has also been in federal office for just more than three years.
6. Catherine Cortez Masto: She’s the Latina politician with the best shot at being Biden’s pick. Masto was elected to the Senate in 2016 and previously served as Nevada’s attorney general for two terms. Winning Nevada shouldn’t be an issue for Democrats, as it has trended to the left in recent years. But it wouldn’t hurt to have an insurance policy.
5. Tammy Baldwin: This is the first pick on this list that comes from one of the true battleground states. Baldwin has served as a senator from Wisconsin since 2012, when she became the first openly gay person ever elected to the Senate. Two years after Trump’s narrow win in her state, she won reelection by 11 points in 2018.
4. Elizabeth Warren: When it comes to trying to unite the party after the Democratic primary, she might be the best pick. She overlaps with Sanders on many policies and could help make sure those voters don’t stay home or cross over to support Trump, as some did in 2016. At the same time, she’s also a septuagenarian who will turn 71 in June, which isn’t ideal as a backup for Biden. As a liberal senator from Massachusetts and former Harvard University professor with demonstrated struggles over her past claims to Native American heritage, it’s not difficult to see how she might be attacked. Oh, and there is the issue of Massachusetts having a Republican governor who would be filling the vacancy temporarily, but the Democratic-dominated state legislature could change the rules.
3. Gretchen Whitmer: If Biden wants a running mate who hails from one of the three key states that Trump carried narrowly in 2016 — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the Michigan governor makes the most sense. She’s also notably been among Trump’s most vocal critics during the coronavirus outbreak. Trump at one point even said he told Vice President Pence not to call Whitmer because of her criticism. That’s not to say she’s doing this for any reason other than she’s concerned about the federal response in her state, but this could be a key argument for the Biden campaign in the general election, and she’s been out front on it.
2. Amy Klobuchar: The senator from Minnesota did Biden a major solid by dropping out of the race ahead of Super Tuesday and helping him win that state. She also earned strong reviews for her debate performances, and she has the kind of Midwestern appeal that could help in a state such as Michigan or Wisconsin. Her electoral history is pretty sterling. One drawback, though, is that she ran as a more pragmatic candidate in the primary and wouldn’t necessarily appeal to liberals who feel strongly about issues such as Medicare-for-all. That said, her Senate record is unmistakably liberal.
1. Kamala D. Harris: There’s a reason Harris tops many of these lists: She’s perhaps the most logical choice. She’s the only black woman serving as either a governor or senator right now. Her presidential campaign flamed out after an early surge, and given her background as a prosecutor, it is easy to see her playing the traditional VP role of attacking the opposition. At the same time, one person she attacked in rather personal terms during the primary was Biden, whose past position on busing she vehemently criticized, while comparing her own experience with the issue. The main criticism of her campaign was that it wasn’t really about anything, and even on busing, her position didn’t wind up being much different than what Biden’s had been. Perhaps having her own message will be less of an issue, though, when she’s running as part of a ticket."

In Vietnam and India, it's rice. In Cambodia, it's fish and rice.
With grain-export giants Russia and Ukraine, the world is watching their next moves.
A steady rise in countries limiting or banning food exports has triggered warnings from U.N. food agency leaders about possible disruptions to the global food supply as the world retrenches amid the coronavirus pandemic — potentially making critical staples such as wheat and rice more costly and harder to find.
For exporting countries, domestic reserves of grains and rice are generally good after years of relatively good harvests, according to the United Nations’ food and agriculture program.
But reductions in exports could hit countries in Africa, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf and other regions that import much of their food.
Prices for rice and wheat are starting to climb as some countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, go on a buying spree to boost their stockpiles. Other concerns include how long closures of borders and transport networks will disrupt global food supplies.
But protectionist moves by some food-exporting countries — to hold on to their products in a time of crisis — raise wider issues of global food security and the hard-edge competition between nations for medical supplies and other goods even as the world faces a common enemy.
Why the U.N. is worried
“Now is the time to show solidarity, act responsibly,” the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization said last week in a statement.
“We learned from previous crises,” the statement continued, “that such measures are particularly damaging for low-income, food-deficit countries and to the efforts of humanitarian organizations to procure food for those in desperate need.”
But when one country acts, others tend to follow.
On March 25, Vietnam, the world’s third-largest rice exporter, halted new rice export contracts, then revised the decision Tuesday in favor of a quota. Last week, India’s powerful Rice Exporters Association announced it would halt new rice contracts.
Cambodia’s leader, Prime Minister Hun Sen, ordered a ban Tuesday on all rice and fish exports and asked people to plant vegetables and other crops for local markets “during this difficult time.”
In Turkey, lemon exports are being curbed to ensure enough for use in a popular lemon-scented mixture often splashed on hands and face. Serbia has announced a ban on exports of sunflower oil. Egypt has barred exports of legumes for three months.
“If these spread to more major exporters and more widely traded products . . . it could get dire indeed,” said Cullen S. Hendrix, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, based in Washington.
As recently as 2011, food export bans in Ukraine and Russia had a devastating impact, leading to hunger and protests in Africa, and potentially contributing to Arab Spring unrest.
“This is why the major exporters of the [Group of 20 industrialized nations] need to be clear in their commitments to maintaining open markets and trade,” he added, calling export bans “a blunt tool that causes blunt-force trauma.”
Pledges for exports to flow
So far, the West and many allies have made no moves to put up barriers to food exports — even as border closures and travel restrictions keep farmworkers from tending the fields.
President Trump has pushed American agricultural exports even as the United States became the center of the pandemic. Separately, a range of nations, including Australia, Canada, Chile and New Zealand, have pledged to keep trade and food flowing.
David Laborde, senior research fellow at the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), said there is no crisis yet, with global food stocks relatively high. So far less than 1 percent of the global food value, in calorie terms, is affected by the export restrictions.
But he warned that the danger of a handful of nations imposing export quotas or moratoriums has a cascading effect that could clog global markets.
“In the last few days, we have a small country like Moldova which was saying, ‘Oh, because Ukraine and Russia are taking measures, we should do it, even if actually we don’t need it.’ This imitation, this domino effect is something we always have to worry about,” he said.
Opposition to the curbs
The main concerns are Vietnam’s moratorium on new rice export contracts, and Kazakhstan’s move to slash exports of wheat and flour, which will hit neighboring countries in Central Asia.
On March 22, the Kazakhstan government announced a ban on exports of flour and other key food products despite ample reserves.
The country’s farmers and grain millers pushed back, especially after finally breaking into the coveted Chinese market in recent years. The total ban was soon reversed, but the government slapped on restrictive export quotas on flour and wheat.
“The case of Kazakhstan in the flour restriction may have a very strong impact regionally in Central Asia and Afghanistan that get most of their supply of wheat product from Kazakhstan,” Laborde said. “The specific case of Central Asia, is, I would say, of concern.”
When Chinese customers called the director of a top Kazakh flour mill last week, director Dos-Mukasan Taukebayev had to turn them down.
“If the restrictions are not lifted, then our industry will collapse. Many enterprises will go bankrupt, and thousands of people will lose jobs,” said Taukebayev, director of Karaganda-based Mutlu flour mill, one of the nation’s biggest. “Exports are vital to us.”
Russia and Ukraine also have reversed or at least partially walked back grain export restrictions, although Russia said it was reviewing the situation week by week.
Trouble in the past
But both nations have intervened heavily in grain markets in the past, leading the price hikes and shortages. In 2010, Russia banned wheat exports after drought and wildfires that destroyed 53 million acres of crops. In 2007 and 2008, Russia imposed an export tax on wheat. Ukraine implemented quotas from 2006 to 2008 and again from 2010 to 2011.
High global food prices in 2008 sparked food riots in 48 countries according to a 2011 World Food Program paper. In 2011 food price spikes exacerbated hunger in East Africa where Somalia faced a famine that killed 260,000 according to the United Nations, nearly half of them children.
On March 20, after panic buying of buckwheat in Russia, the government announced a 10-day ban on all exports of processed grains, only to cancel the order four days later. It then announced a 7.7 million-ton quota on grain exports from April to June. The amount, however, does not appear to be a significant reduction based on Russia’s annual export outputs, which includes wheat exports of about 35 million tons.
The Eurasian Economic Union (Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan) banned exports of sunflower seeds, onions and vegetables outside the union.
In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced restrictions on food exports on March 16 without offering details, setting off alarm.
But the measures had a limited impact: a ban on the buckwheat exports, not a major export, and a wheat export quota of 22 million tons in 2019-20 that was in line with expected exports.
Alex Lissitsa, president of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club, said Zelensky seemed to be trying to reassure Ukrainians that he was keeping prices down.
“There's no reason to ban the export of wheat right now. . . . Ukraine has an oversupply of many products,” Lissitsa said. “We need to export. Otherwise, we'll actually die with our products here.”
Kazakhstan’s wheat farmers and flour millers see the risk of losing years of hard work cultivating markets in China and Central Asia.
Pyotr Svoik, an independent economist based in Almaty, said the Kazakh government was trying to maintain low domestic prices for socially important goods like bread and flour.
“Kazakhstan produces considerably more wheat and flour than it consumes. Therefore, exports are necessary, and now this issue is especially acute, amid falling oil prices, on which the country's economy depends,” he said."
"April 9, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/08/oil-price-war-coronavirus/,The Washington Post,A truce in the oil-price war could come this week. U.S. energy firms are still bracing for a recession.,"As the belligerents in the oil-price war that has upended global energy markets prepare for talks Thursday, the Trump administration is putting pressure on all sides to strike a deal to cut output even as it rules out parallel American reductions.
Saudi Arabia called for the teleconference in a bid to end its price competition with Russia. For a month, both countries have been readying to pump as much oil as possible — even as the coronavirus pandemic slashes consumption worldwide — in a bid that has cratered the price per barrel.
American shale oil producers have felt much of the pain, and this week the Energy Information Administration predicted that by summer the United States would once again become a net importer of oil, as domestic production contracts and overseas markets shrivel.
President Trump predicted Friday that a deal was at hand, but days have gone by with neither side committing to it.
The United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia are the Big 3 oil-producing nations, and the other two want to see American cuts in proportion to their own. But Washington cannot unilaterally order such reductions, and Trump said he wouldn’t do it anyway, though there is a proposal that Texas act at the state level. He has hinted that he might impose tariffs on imported oil, over opposition from the major American companies.
The tumbling market, in any case, is likely to force U.S. companies to scale back. It was unclear Wednesday if the Russians and Saudis would be willing to accept that on their way to a truce.
There is no precedent for what is happening in the oil business, but the best analogy might be the collapse of prices in 1931, at the height of the Great Depression.
“The ’30s, in a way that never would have been expected, really resound today,” said Daniel Yergin, author of “The Prize,” a history of the oil industry. Then, as today, there was “economic paralysis and a sudden flood of oil.”
Ninety years ago, the flood came out of the newly discovered Black Giant field in East Texas. By May, the price in Texas had fallen from about $1 a barrel to 15 cents. The Texas Railroad Commission tried to impose quotas, but it was repeatedly stopped by the courts. Finally, the governor sent National Guard troops to East Texas to enforce what was called “pro-rationing.”
The price recovered. But there was one big difference between then and now: American oil consumption appears to have fallen about 14 percent between 1929 and 1932, the worst years of the Depression (based on production figures). That’s significant, and it was painful. But today consumption is on the way to a drop of 20 to 25 percent, over a period not of three years but of weeks.
Back then, “we had nothing like this sudden and massive demand contraction that we see now,” said Robert McNally, head of the petroleum analytic firm Rapidan Energy.
The bright side, said Yergin, is that the current consumption downturn is unlikely to last as long as it did in the Depression. And production is certain to decline rapidly.
“The harsh reality indicates that there will be some kind of deal or understanding to reduce the flood of oil,” he said.
That’s what the Saudis say they hope to get out of Thursday’s conference of what are called the OPEC Plus nations, to be followed Friday by talks among energy officials of the Group of 20 nations, also sponsored by Riyadh.
Some analysts are pessimistic a deal can be reached this week, but many agree one will have to emerge sooner rather than later, because available storage capacity for excess oil is rapidly filling up.
Michael Hsueh, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said in a note that any agreement that falls short of a 10 million barrel-a-day cut could not be considered a success, but given how many countries are involved in two days of meetings, and the short time frame to hammer out a complicated agreement, “there are more than the usual number of pitfalls here.""
And even if production cuts do come out of the talks, it is unlikely they will compensate for the continuing drop in demand.
Rystad Energy, a Norwegian analytical firm, said Wednesday it expects a 27.5 percent drop in consumption in April, compared with a year ago, with some improvement predicted for May.
The Energy Information Administration forecast a decline in U.S. consumption of 500,000 barrels a day this year, compared with 2019.
But IHS Markit, the company Yergin is associated with, predicts a fall of 2.9 million barrels a day, or close to 15 percent of American consumption.
The global price of oil is down about 60 percent since February, but an analyst with Rystad, Bjornar Tonhaugen, said in a note Wednesday that the market price still does not accurately reflect the gigantic stores of oil that have built up worldwide, and which will continue to exert pressure downward.
Oil producers plan to cut their spending, mostly on new wells, by 36 percent. This week Exxon, the last holdout, announced it was cutting such capital spending by 30 percent, or about $10 billion.
Most of those cuts will be felt in the United States and Canada, where shale and sand tar oil are more expensive to produce, than in the Middle East, offshore or in Russia. “Oil spending is falling around the world, but the most dramatic cuts are in North America,” Dan Pratt, of a subsidiary called IHS Herold, said in a note.
Some oil producers have asked the Texas Railroad Commission to reimpose quotas, for the first time since 1972. Others oppose the move. The commission meets April 14. No one, at this point, expects the governor to have to send troops into the oil fields, in a replay of the 1930s. But as Yergin pointed out, no one expected this kind of “demand shock,” either, until it happened."

After inquiring about possible rent relief because of the novel coronavirus outbreak and statewide business closures, the Trump Organization wired Palm Beach County $88,339.12 on Tuesday, satisfying its April obligations, according to emails between the county and a Trump Organization official.
The rent had been due April 1 for land used by the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, but a Trump Organization executive said earlier this week it could be paid until April 10 without penalty.
The discussions between the Trump Organization and the county prompted questions about whether the president’s private business would miss payments or request government help as a result of the outbreak. So far, the company has closed 18 of its hotels and golf clubs — including the West Palm Beach club — and laid off or furloughed more than 1,600, according to local filings and union officials.
President Trump still owns his company but it is being run by his two adult sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., while he is in office. The $2 trillion stimulus package enacted last month blocked entities owned by the president or vice president from receiving a portion of the federal bailout funds.
“While some of our properties may be closed during this pandemic, the Trump Organization, and all that we stand for, remains very much open!” Eric Trump tweeted on March 31. “We cannot wait to welcome you back home!”
The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday about the rent payment or whether it planned to seek any relief from its financial obligations.
A Palm Beach county official involved in administering the Trump Organization leases, Ray Walter, wrote on April 3 that Ed Raymundo, director of finance for the Trump Organization’s Florida properties, had called to ask for wire transfer instructions.
“I think they just wish to put this behind them,” Walter wrote to other county officials, according to a copy of emails obtained through a public records request.
The Trump Organization also said it had paid the roughly $250,000 monthly rent it owes to the federal government for use of the Old Post Office Pavilion, the federally owned building that houses the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. Spokespersons for the General Services Administration, which manages the lease, did not reply to multiple requests for comment. "
"April 9, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-a-difference-bernie-sanders-made/2020/04/08/5e3eac44-79d0-11ea-a130-df573469f094_story.html,The Washington Post,What a difference Bernie Sanders made,"Sen. Bernie Sanders accomplished far more than he could have imagined on April 30, 2015, the day he first entered presidential politics. Thus the paradox of his announcement Wednesday that he was leaving the 2020 presidential race: It was a victory lap in the form of a concession speech.
The independent from Vermont who allied with the Democratic Party but always kept his distance has a lot to brag about. Across a broad front of issues, he has decisively moved the party leftward.
The most dramatic change, newly central in the coronavirus pandemic, is on health care. By popularizing Medicare-for-all, he has shifted the entire conversation. Now, the moderate position in his party is universal coverage with a public option, an approach that was out of the Democrats’ reach when they passed Obamacare a decade ago.
He has made the $15 minimum wage party doctrine, and if Democrats were to gain the presidency and control of Congress this fall, they would, thanks in part to Sanders and his movement, be bolder in containing climate change, increasing access to higher education and rolling back economic inequality.
Sanders also benefited from a shift in opinion that he encouraged but did not invent: the growing disenchantment of younger Americans with capitalism in the wake of the Great Recession. “The future of this country is with our ideas,” he declared in his video from Burlington, Vt. While young people who vote in Democratic primaries are no doubt to the left of those who don’t, he had a point. Americans under the age of 35 are the country’s most progressive generation since the cohort that powered the New Deal coalition. Sanders gave them a voice.
Yet the movement he built came in parts. Its left wing did not want Sanders to withdraw in favor of former vice president Joe Biden, whose campaign drew an enormous boost from Wednesday’s news. This part of the Sanders coalition was always more of a third party than a Democratic constituency.
On the other side, elected officials who supported Sanders felt his time was up. Primary results and national polls showed that Sanders represented only about a third of the Democratic Party. Biden did not arouse the same opposition from blue-collar Democrats that Hillary Clinton did in 2016, which meant that Biden beat Sanders in many of the Midwestern counties the insurgent had won four years earlier.
Thus did Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) write Sanders’s longtime adviser Jeff Weaver on Tuesday night arguing that the “goodwill he gets by acting sooner is more leverage [with] Biden than prolonged battle.”
In effect, Sanders split the difference, staying on the ballot to gather delegates and influence the party but formally ending his campaign with warm words about Biden. Sanders’s relationship with Biden was always better than his rapport with Clinton, and Sanders always felt that Biden had a personal commitment to working-class voters whose standard Sanders saw himself as lifting.
But the biggest difference-maker was President Trump. “Hillary was polarizing on our side,” Welch said in an interview. “Trump is unifying on our side.”
If the threat a Trump presidency posed to the country was not as obvious to many as it should have been in 2016 — partly because few expected Trump to win — the peril a reelected Trump would represent to democratic institutions is obvious across the party. The Democrats’ desire to defeat Trump not only fed the surge to Biden after his defeats in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, but also influenced Sanders’s own thinking once Biden started winning.
Welch sees Sanders as central to Biden’s chances of winning support from a “progressive left who don’t particularly support the Democratic Party as an institution but whom we need to get out to vote.”
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), another Sanders supporter and co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus, also hopes Sanders can push Biden to address the concerns of voters who may have drifted to Trump or were indifferent to Democrats because “their lives are in such a state of devastation.”
In the end, she said in an interview, Sanders’s greatest contribution may involve demonstrating the importance of what she called “inside/outside politics.” Sanders and his movement sought to create outside pressure on elected officials, but also encouraged its members to join the electoral fray and win places at the tables of influence. The goal “is a change in belief about what is possible and then figuring out how to move things on a tangible level.”
Jayapal cited Frederick Douglass’s observation: “Power concedes nothing without a demand.” It might well be the slogan of the Sanders movement. Its task now is to elect a president open to its demands and responsive to its hopes. With his decision, Sanders made it as clear as he could that Donald Trump will never be that person."
"April 9, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/cash-for-clunkers-wont-work-in-china-either/2020/04/08/ac314436-79f1-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,Don’t Let This Billion Dollar Bailout Fool You,"China’s stimulus for the auto industry has been all over the map. Measures that help some players wind up setting back priorities for others. But one thing is clear: The billions of yuan that vaulted China to become the world’s largest car market aren’t there. Don’t be fooled by the numbers you see in coming months.
All told, China’s aid package adds up to around 8 billion yuan ($1.13 billion), according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That’s a far cry from the 25 billion yuan to 30 billion yuan spent just on electric vehicle incentives last year, or the 100-billion-yuan-plus laid out in the 2015 to 2017 stimulus cycle. There’s a bigger problem than fiscal constraints, though. Beijing’s policies will do little to boost consumer demand and only add volume — exactly what a market awash in supply doesn’t need. Big discretionary spending items like cars are unlikely to top post-coronavirus shopping lists, even if people are initially wary of public transportation.
In recent weeks, policymakers have laid out a slew of measures to boost sales, which were slumping even before Covid-19. Subsidies that were supposed to end this year have been extended to 2022. The government is incentivizing auto companies in several provinces to meet targets and high growth rates, and urging them to offer sweeteners for bulk purchases. In other cities, like Hangzhou, restrictions on license plates — aimed at curbing excessive sales — are being loosened and quotas expanded. Yet all this easing of limits on conventional cars has come at the cost of the drive toward greener ones. Electric-vehicle specific policies have been lackluster.
The latest program looks a lot like the U.S.’s cash for clunkers experiment of 2009. In places like Tianjin and Hebei, the central government is turning to vouchers and coupons instead of the usual subsidies. In Beijing, for instance, car owners can get 7,000 yuan this year, and a little less next year, for scrapping older, higher emission models or transferring them out of the city. Local officials are also urging automakers to match or exceed government offers for shoppers who then go and buy new vehicles. In theory, this program cleans out old stock, encourages sales and makes people feel like they can start spending again. In the U.S., this ultimately backfired because it shifted demand to cheaper cars and reduced spending.
Most of the perks laid out, if they stick, will result in soaring sales and a steep recovery. (Electric car sales, meanwhile, will remain subdued.) Local brands like Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., SAIC Motor Corp., Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. and BYD Co. will likely post figures closer to those before the viral outbreak. But things will look good for all the wrong reasons.
For clues about the health of China’s auto market, investors may be better served looking elsewhere. Dealership traffic and sales of foreign, especially luxury, carmakers that stayed ahead of the broader market will be a clearer indication of demand. While 98.8% of dealers have re-opened and are aggressively luring consumers, showroom traffic is still around 66%. The SAIC-General Motors Corp.-Wuling venture for instance, is subsidizing buyers with a targeted total amount of 1 billion yuan, according to CLSA Ltd. Last month, they launched a no-questions-asked return policy within 30 days for their newly launched Baojun series.
Another area to watch is premium car sales and pricing. Big luxury automakers haven’t been major beneficiaries partly because some of the perks are focused on lower-tier cities, where there are more joint ventures with foreign players that haven’t done so well. No one’s scrapping a Beemer anytime soon.
Since many of the incentives are coming from local governments, it will also be important to assess sales on a city-by-city or regional basis. Shanghai and Hangzhou are saturated markets – their ability to significantly boost purchases by loosening restrictions is much lower than areas in central and western China, where numbers may start rising a lot faster.
The other lever Beijing will lean on is household credit. While China relies less on auto financing than other countries, the sector is still growing quickly. The market for auto asset-backed securities, backed by pools of car loans, is also booming, so performance here will be key. Prepayments will be another tell-tale sign; who is paying and who isn’t. Already, delinquency rates for some buyers are rising faster than others.
In the bust, boost and boom cycle of China’s car market, there will be more losers than winners — the glossy stimulus headlines won’t help you find them. It’ll take a bit more digging."

Over the past three months, top executives of companies based in mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore have told investors that they are looking for acquisitions. They include Victor Li, who took over Hong Kong’s CK group from his father Li Ka-shing two years ago, and billionaire Guo Guangchang, the founder of the acquisitive Chinese conglomerate, Fosun Group.
Major stock indexes in the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific all plunged about 20% in the first quarter in their worst rout since the 2008 financial crisis, making retail chains to hotels and property developers attractive to suitors. Cash-rich conglomerates like Li’s CK group are in a position to invest when others struggle as they are built to defend against the bad times, said Jonathan Galligan, group deputy head of research at CLSA Ltd.
“This is a tremendous opportunity for any company with cash,” Galligan said. “If you look at what’s happened in the global market, right now cash is king.”
The junior Li, now chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., CK Asset Holdings Ltd. and CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd., told analysts on March 19 that the group’s cash flow and balance sheet are strong and the impact of the virus offers “opportunities to look at new acquisitions.” He didn’t elaborate.
Biggest Test
For the 55-year-old Li, the market rout has come as his biggest test since his father passed on the baton in May 2018. The now retired senior Li, 91, came to Hong Kong as a refugee but went on to transform a plastic flower business into a ports-to-telecommunications empire spanning the world.
CK Hutchison, the main flagship, said it had HK$145 billion ($18.7 billion) of cash and liquid investments as of December, which is 3.6 times its short-term debt and 1.7 times its debt maturing over 2020 and 2021, according to S&P Global Ratings. The group spent $5.5 billion last year acquiring assets including British pub operator Greene King Plc, following about $15.2 billion of purchases the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The chaos triggered by the disease is also posing another challenge for prospective buyers. Governments are preemptively trying to ward off predatory buying, with policy makers from Australia to Spain, Italy and Germany introducing or considering stricter rules to help shield strategically important domestic companies.
The regulatory barriers may make some acquisitions harder, far from the days when Chinese conglomerates such as HNA Group Co. loaded up on debt and paid top dollar for assets from U.S. technology firms to European aviation businesses.
“For companies like Li’s, they depend very much on acquisitions to grow, and that could be a big challenge in the long term,” said Jackie Yan, an assistant professor in management and strategy at the University of Hong Kong.
Li, however, is no stranger to rejections by overseas regulators. In 2018, Australia rejected CK’s bid to buy APA Group, an operator of gas pipelines, for A$13 billion ($8 billion), on national security concerns. Had it been successful, that would’ve been CK’s biggest overseas purchase.
In its wake, the pandemic is likely to leave behind many ruined businesses after billions of people spent days in lockdowns and curtailed spending. In the U.S., 50,000 retail stores have shut in just over a week. More than half of U.K. firms have just three months’ cash in reserve or less, according to a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce. The International Finance Corp. said last week that it had received 315 requests for financing from companies and small- and medium-sized enterprises in 70 countries.
Leverage Resources
Fosun International Ltd.’s Chairman Guo said March 31 that the company will leverage its worldwide resources to identify opportunities. The company had 93.6 billion yuan ($13.2 billion) in cash and equivalents last year, compared with 82.7 billion yuan of short-term debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The group is into health care, insurance and hospitality.
Singapore’s biggest developer, CapitaLand Ltd., which bought Arlington Business Park in the U.K. in February, is seeking similar “counter cyclical” opportunities amid the virus downturn, its Chief Financial Officer Andrew Lim told analysts the same month.
CLSA’s Galligan also said that should the economic pain intensify, some countries may even welcome investments.
“In this market dislocation, our long-term approach means that we can hunt for mispriced companies with solid fundamentals,” Todd Barlow, managing director of Australia-based investment holding company Washington H. Soul Pattinson & Co., said in an earnings call last month."
"April 9, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/hospital-admissions-for-strokes-appear-to-have-plummeted-a-doctors-says-a-possible-sign-people-are-afraid-to-seek-critical-help/2020/04/08/2048b886-79ac-11ea-b6ff-597f170df8f8_story.html,The Washington Post,"Hospital admissions for strokes appear to have plummeted, a doctor says, a possible sign people are afraid to seek critical help","This past week, I received a call from a former patient. Two years ago, she arrived at our hospital for emergency treatment of a stroke, caused by a blockage in a blood vessel supplying the left side of her brain. Thanks to recent advances in stroke treatment and systems of care that emphasize the importance of swift treatment to preserve brain function, she had a dramatic recovery.
But she was calling because her sister had developed symptoms of a stroke two days earlier. In the covid-19 era, both had been anxious about calling emergency services and about coming into the hospital. Unfortunately, the sister’s stroke progressed rapidly, and she died before we could arrange any medical attention.
In recent days, like most stroke and critical care neurologists around the country, my colleagues and I at Yale New Haven Hospital have been preparing to receive a tsunami of coronavirus patients, who require hospital admission often in critical condition. But we have also taken steps to make emergency treatments of routine illnesses — such as heart attacks or strokes — continuously available.
Despite all this, anecdotal observations reveal something none of us anticipated: Stroke admissions here have plummeted 60 to 80 percent of their usual volume over the past month. Initially, I was convinced that this statistic was a random, transient event that would not last. Now, I am not so sure.
Lulls in stroke admission in normal times last a day or two, not weeks and they will be seen in one center, not across the board. But in speaking with colleagues around the country, it is clear my medical center is not alone. Stroke volumes appear to be dropping almost everywhere, and the same may be true for heart attacks and other conditions. So I am a more than a little concerned.
In the coming months, we will need to make sure that these anecdotal reports are confirmed by evidence. And already, there are multiple efforts underway, many supported by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.
The first question to answer is whether there are actually fewer strokes occurring right now, or if patients are still having strokes but not coming to the hospital, as was suggested by the experience of my patient’s sister.
Using population-based samples, we can start to get at these questions. But we don’t have any strong reason to believe that fewer strokes are occurring. Stress and immobility — such as from a self-quarantine — can actually increase the frequency of these conditions. If fewer strokes are occurring, then we will really have to take a hard look at risk factors that may exist in daily life (and which we don’t normally focus on when thinking of stroke risk) that may now be muted.
The greater concern is that Americans are continuing to have strokes, but they are not calling 911 and not coming to the hospital. Individuals may assume that this is a bad time, or risky, to call an ambulance or be at the hospital. While stay-at-home guidance is a key element of diminishing the spread of covid-19, this would be the wrong decision if you are having stroke symptoms — including facial weakness, slurred speech, change in language or weakness in an arm or leg.
For emergencies, such as a stroke or heart attack, rescue squads are still on the clock and specialized stroke teams stand waiting at hospitals throughout the country. For stroke, time is brain, more time away from help can mean progression of a stroke, worse outcome and closing of a time-sensitive treatment window that can help patients recover without little or no damage.
To be clear — as in usual times, do not wait to get help if you suspect sudden symptoms of a stroke. The AHA/ASA’s Stroke Council Leadership has published emergency guidance for U.S. stroke centers during the covid-19 crisis. This guidance supports keeping stroke systems of care up and running, while using appropriate means to keep health-care workers and patients safe during evaluation and treatment in the emergency setting.
In my hospital’s neuroscience intensive care unit, we have developed contingency plans to allocate beds for emergency strokes. Hospitals around the country are doing the same. Patients should feel comfortable knowing that deployment of teams in dynamic, resource-limited environments is something that is long embedded in the practice of every stroke team.
It is true that we are in a crisis with covid-19, but our communities need not compound any suffering that might result as a consequence of not seeking prompt care for serious, but treatable, conditions such as stroke."

McConnell had sought unanimous consent in the Senate Thursday for the small business aid requested by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Monday may be the next chance to quickly approve more aid without objection, and lawmakers aren’t scheduled to return to Washington until the week of April 20.
“We need more funding and we need it fast,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. “The country cannot afford unnecessary wrangling or political maneuvering.”
Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, a co-sponsor of the small business Paycheck Protection Program, objected to the majority leader’s proposal, calling it “a political stunt.” Cardin said the PPP hasn’t run out of money but other programs have, and he said the PPP process needs to be streamlined to make it easier for small businesses to get loans.
Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are seeking to double the GOP’s $250 billion request for the slumping economy, including more federal aid for state and local governments and added funding for hospitals struggling to treat a crush of coronavirus patients.
“It’s beyond disappointing that Senate Democrats would choose to block our efforts to provide more emergency relief to small businesses,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.
Pelosi told reporters in a conference call that McConnell knew his proposal would fail.
“We want to make sure it is done in the best way for the most people,” Pelosi said. “We have time to negotiate to see how and where and when we should have more money there.”
Plea for Urgency
There have been complaints of bigger banks only dealing with their existing customers.
Over the past week, borrowers said they were turned away by banks when they didn’t already have a lending account. Banks have been wary about hastily approving loans for new customers and blame time-consuming federal rules requiring them to verify customer identity to catch terrorists and money launderers.
Self-Employed Set to Join Virus Plan Already Overrun With Demand
As part of his plea for urgency, McConnell cited Thursday’s report that showed an additional 6.6 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. That brings the three-week total to 16.8 million claims, or one in 10 American workers.
Mnuchin had asked Congress to approve by the end of the week an additional $250 billion for the program, bringing the total amount available to $600 billion. The only way to accomplish that with lawmakers out of town would be if no member of the House or Senate objected.
There have been no negotiations between Republican and Democratic leaders on a compromise, and Pelosi signaled she had no intention of bringing McConnell’s proposal to the House.
It could be harder for the House to get unanimous support for virus-related aid, since some Republicans say members should have to go on record with their votes to spend taxpayer money. Pelosi said House leaders are considering voting by proxy or other measures to protect members from having to risk virus infection by traveling to Washington.
”I will be very frank with you. We don’t want anybody coming back at a time that might not be healthy for them,” said Pelosi.
‘Bipartisan Fixes’
The Payroll Protection Program is a key part of the $2.2 trillion pandemic response package passed late last month. Stay-at-home orders across the country have particularly squeezed small businesses, which account for almost half of U.S. private employment. McConnell said that program is the only one immediately short of funding.
About a third of the $350 billion designated for the small business loan program has already been committed in the first few days since lenders began accepting applications. Technical and regulatory difficulties have frustrated many small business owners, sparking concerns that the fund could run out before they access the loans.
Pelosi and Schumer on Wednesday proposed adding $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local governments to Mnuchin’s request. They also want half of the additional small business aid -- or $125 billion -- channeled through community-based and other financial institutions that serve companies owned by farmers, families, women, minorities and veterans.
Democrats also wanted to temporarily increase food stamps, make it easier to get them and clarify that farms are eligible for the PPP program.
The two Maryland Democrats in the Senate chamber Thursday argued that there are other issues with the PPP that need to be addressed, rather than simply adding more money. Cardin and Senator Chris Van Hollen urged bipartisan talks like last month’s negotiations to pass the CARES Act stimulus package.
Ironically, Van Hollen had been among Democrats who originally proposed a $600 billion rescue package for small businesses -- the total PPP funding McConnell was now seeking.
“We know we need more money for this program -- many of us predicted this before we passed the Cares Act,” Van Hollen said. “But for goodness’s sakes, let’s take the opportunity to make some bipartisan fixes to allow this program to work better for the very people it’s designed to help.”"
"April 9, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/monthly-loss-of-431-billion-spurs-insurance-claims-across-us/2020/04/08/cd98fc1e-799b-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,Monthly Loss of $431 Billion Spurs Insurance Claims Across U.S.,"Barbara Snowden dreamed of opening a wig shop to help women who’d lost their hair during chemotherapy feel better as they battled cancer. In November, she beamed at the grand opening of Hair Goals Club in the Houston suburb of Humble, Texas.
But four months later, her dream died when local officials ordered all non-essential services closed to combat the spread of coronavirus. Snowden had paid for insurance covering unexpected losses, but a quick answer came back on her claim: Nope. Like so many other small business owners in America, she was told her policy didn’t cover disruptions from a pandemic.
“I cried like a baby because I couldn’t believe it,” Snowden said. “That insurance was my last line of defense.”
Now it’s part of a legal fight that may reach every state over who should pay for the steep revenue losses from the deadly Covid-19 virus. Snowden is among a dozen business owners -- including celebrity chefs, Native American casino operators, restaurant chains, a scuba-diving shop and a movie theater operator -- who sued insurers for refusing to honor policies.
They’re the first of what legal experts predict will be widespread litigation brought by policy holders. Companies big and small have been forced to figure out how to pay bills with no money coming in for weeks or months. While the government pledged help with loans and financial aid, it may not be enough for many businesses to survive.
Huge Stakes
The stakes also are huge for insurers. They say business-interruption policies, many of which specifically exclude pandemics, were only intended for physical damage and were never priced to cover a virus outbreak. Industry groups also oppose some states trying to require payments to small firms even if virus losses were excluded.
Companies with 100 employees or fewer could see business continuity losses of as much as $431 billion a month, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association estimated without breaking down how much would be insured costs. That’s nine times more than the $47 billion the industry said it paid for covered losses from the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when only a third of claims were for business interruption, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
“They wouldn’t offer some of these contracts if they were required to cover pandemics,” said Benjamin Collier, an assistant professor in the risk, insurance and healthcare management department at Temple University’s Fox School of Business. “They wouldn’t offer business interruption insurance at all, or in cases where they might be willing to, they would charge substantially different rates.”
Virus Exclusions
While business-interruption policies cover the cost of closing due to everything from fires to tornado damage to burst pipes, the industry often has exclusions to avoid massive payouts all at once from a single event like a war or pandemic. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, some insurers added specific exclusions for losses from viruses and communicable diseases.
The legal battle will be fought state by state -- each with its own insurance laws -- which may mean different outcomes.
The language for business-interruption policies can vary between insurers, even though some virus exclusions are similar. And there are often differences for larger clients whose policies are highly customized. Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a March 30 note that many insurers he’s spoken to believe a majority of their policies exclude virus-related risks.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“P&C insurers, including Travelers and Hartford, face a bigger risk from states potentially forcing the payment of uncovered claims vs. early business interruption lawsuits, where they have the edge, in our view.”
-- Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Elliott Stein, senior litigation analyst
But even carefully crafted policies may not be enough to protect the insurers, says Robert Zarco, a Miami-based lawyer who represents thousands of McDonald’s, Burger King and Hilton hotel franchisees gearing up to file business-interruption suits.Many policies include civil-authority clauses that kick in when governments bring business operations to a screeching halt, Zarco said. “We have plenty of grounds to argue that’s exactly what happened here and they still have to pay,” he said.
Policyholders also can argue shutdowns over bug-contaminated surfaces are a form of physical damage that is a prerequisite for a lawful claim, according to John Houghtaling, a New Orleans lawyer who filed the first Covid-19 business-interruption case on behalf of Oceana Grill, a restaurant in the city’s French Quarter.
‘Winning Position’
“I believe we have a 100% winning position in the case,” said Houghtaling, who filed the suit in state court in New Orleans. He’s asking Judge Ethel Julian to schedule a quick hearing on his suit, which seeks a judgment barring insurers from refusing to pay business-interruption claims.
As the litigation gears up, New Jersey, Ohio and Massachusetts have proposed new laws that would require insurers to pay certain claims related to Covid-19.
New Jersey’s proposed bill, which is on hold, would require business-interruption payments for companies with 100 or fewer full-time employees. Massachusetts’s bill would require reimbursing firms with 150 or fewer employees and would invalidate exclusions for virus losses.
“Pandemic outbreaks are uninsured because they are uninsurable,” David Sampson, chief executive officer of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said in an emailed statement. Forcing insurers to pay such claims “threatens solvency and the ability to make good on the actual promises made in existing insurance policies,” he said.While legislators debate and lawyers wrangle, Snowden says she’s trying to survive until either help arrives from the government or the insurance company admits it erred.“I’m trying to sell the wigs over the internet, but it isn’t doing much,” she said. “I thought that insurance would carry me through. I don’t know what I’m going to do now.”

"April 10, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/private-equity-denied-access-again-in-senates-new-loan-bill/2020/04/08/1ea05dac-79c7-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,Private Equity Denied Access Again in Senate’s New Loan Bill,"Private-equity firms have been dealt a setback in their latest attempt to get companies they own access to billions of dollars of loans that the U.S. government is doling out to help small businesses hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
The next bill in the U.S. Senate doesn’t give the industry relief it has been seeking as lawmakers negotiate another round of economic stimulus, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.
Private equity has been lobbying aggressively in recent days to get Congress to clarify that portfolio companies controlled by the industry are eligible for the Small Business Administration loans.
The problem: In rules laid out by the SBA and the massive $2 trillion rescue bill that Congress passed last month, firms with more than 500 employees don’t qualify for the loans. That number counts affiliates –- a definition that could include the workers at all the portfolio companies that a private-equity firm invests in.
Administration’s Request
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday will try to unanimously pass a bill that simply reflects the White House request for more funding, without changing the program’s rules. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked Congress Tuesday to add $250 billion to the $350 billion that lawmakers have already authorized for the small-business lending effort, known as the Paycheck Protection Program.
Democrats have outlined several demands for the pending legislation and so far have not sought the private equity changes.
Congress is expected to debate a wider stimulus package sometime after April 20 that will give private equity another chance to try access the program. In the meantime, lawmakers sympathetic to their complaints are trying to work with the administration on rules changes, said one of the two people.
The issue over how employees are counted is also affecting venture-capital firms, which have funded a number of tech startups. That has prompted industry executives to attempt to lobby House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom they hope may be sympathetic. The Democrat’s district in San Francisco is near Silicon Valley.
Stumbling Block
But a potential stumbling block is the deep resentment Capitol Hill progressives have toward private equity. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats have made the industry a target of attacks, particularly in an election year that has been focused on themes of economic fairness and income inequality. It doesn’t help that some private equity leaders, including Blackstone Group Inc.’s Stephen Schwarzman, have close ties to President Donald Trump.
Private equity lobbyists have repeatedly said they are also holding discussions with the SBA and Treasury Department in the hope that those agencies will issue guidance clarifying that portfolio companies can obtain loans. But SBA officials told industry executives privately last month that buyout shops should use their own cash piles to bail out struggling businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.
In a sign of the lobbying heft, 10 trade groups, including the Club For Growth and Heritage Action for America, wrote a letter on Tuesday to Mnuchin and SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza urging them to cut private equity a break.
“We urge to use your authority to waive the SBA’s ‘affiliation’ rules that, without relief, will act as a direct regulatory barrier to job retention and creation at some of the most innovative and exciting companies in our economy,” the groups wrote in the letter. “Make no mistake: some are using the crisis of COVID-19 to punish investors and private businesses that they do not like for political purposes.”"

The decrease appeared in the Fed’s weekly custody data, with the latest figure released Thursday indicating a drop for the week that ended April 8. That’s the sixth straight week of declines and follows a $109 billion drop in March that was the largest monthly fall on record.
The sales occurred before the Fed ramped up its efforts to support the U.S. economy, with as much as $2.3 trillion more aid unveiled Thursday amid a historic surge in unemployment claims. The move is designed to shore up some of the hardest hit parts of the financial markets, which have seen funding strains alongside a global rush to raise U.S. dollars.
As part of the new package, the Fed pledged to buy debt recently downgraded to below investment grade, as well as certain collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The central bank also unveiled sweeping steps to provide additional aid to small and medium-sized businesses, along with state and local governments.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech Thursday that the central bank will act “forcefully, pro-actively, and aggressively” to help the country recover, even as he hinted at limits to that authority.
Policy makers have “shown the markets they are doing whatever it takes for the economy, but now it seems they need to wait and see how things unfold,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for Oanda Corp. in New York.
Key metrics at the heart of the U.S. financial system already show that the flow of money is getting smoother, with the three-month London interbank offered rate for dollars staging its steepest decline in a month on Thursday."

Like, for instance, how to maintain independence from the U.S. Treasury when the economic-support package Congress passed says they should work together? Or whether the same guidelines for companies receiving federal aid, which range from compensation limits to off-shoring restrictions, apply to the Fed if it gets more money from Treasury? And how about which companies -- and perhaps eventually, municipalities and states -- are invited to borrow and at what cost?
These are some of the issues that probably will come up when Powell speaks at a webinar hosted by the Brookings Institution at 10 a.m. in Washington -- in one of his few public appearances since the spread of the coronavirus took hold in the U.S.
Powell has already committed to going where no chairman in postwar history has ever stepped: lending broadly to the largest corporations and planning to buy up loans made to small businesses.Congressional Democrats want the Fed to stretch its boundaries of power even further by purchasing low-rated municipal debt, while Wall Street economists are wondering what’s stopping the Fed from buying junk-rated securities.“This is going to lead to a complete re-examination of the role of central banking and the Fed’s independence,” warns Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, a Washington research firm. The Fed’s steps into credit allocation are tantamount to “a complete redesign of central banking on the fly.”Congress has authorized as much as $454 billion for the Treasury Department to use in consort with programs the Fed can leverage to loan up to $4.5 trillion. Some lawmakers and analysts see no reason why, with that power, the central bank shouldn’t reach into riskier corners of the market.
Government Bonds
Prior to the crisis, the Fed purchased a narrow group of assets, mainly government bonds and those backed by government agencies, such as some mortgage financing.While purchasing municipal bonds on the open market sounds simple, it would thrust the central bank into a thicket of what ultimately will be political choices: Who gets support? Only the highest-rated and richest municipalities? How are such decisions made?”The questions are all the more acute as state and local governments lose tax revenue to an economic shutdown while first responders and medical systems strain resources to manage a pandemic that has already killed about 15,000 Americans.There are similar questions related to corporate debt. As it is funded now, the Fed is free to lend to whomever shows up and wants to pay the fees and rates, so long as the companies are investment grade. But if the Treasury kicks in money recently allocated by Congress, do lawmaker guidelines and restrictions on corporations apply? There’s also the issue of moral hazard. Now that investors and companies know the Fed has their back in a crisis, how do markets price debt risk in the future?
‘Chalk Lines’
“The potential influence on the allocation of credit in corporate and municipal finance is massive,” said Peter Fisher, a clinical professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business and a former official at both the Fed and the Treasury. He hopes they can draw some “chalk lines” to establish boundaries about what each institution is willing and not willing to do.
A Federal Reserve spokesperson declined to comment.
The central bank doesn’t discriminate about who uses its facilities but instead sets market criteria such as credit ratings, prices and fees as the yardstick for entry. For example, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which loans directly to large companies, requires them to have an investment-grade rating and pay a 1% fee up front.
There are also limits on how much debt the companies can issue. The Fed has said market conditions determine the rates companies pay.
What is likely to matter politically a year from now, however, is which companies show up and what cost they paid because Congress also is focused on helping just about anybody who requires aid.
Equity, Fairness
“The emergency assistance needs to be broad-based, not just for the biggest companies or the wealthiest political jurisdictions,” said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth professor and former adviser to the Fed board. “The Federal Reserve needs to be very attentive to issues of equity and fairness, especially when it’s engaging in truly extraordinary measures like this.”
With the $2 trillion stimulus bill, known as the CARES Act, to support the economy, Congress mandated the Treasury work with the Fed to support municipalities, states and businesses. The relationship already is expanding. The Fed said April 6 it will create a program to help speed the flow of funds to small companies by providing term financing to banks against loans issued under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program.
Just how this translates into the Treasury’s relationship with the central bank remains to be seen.
The CARES Act “forces the Fed into this almost intimate relationship with Treasury,” said Mark Spindel, co-author of a book about the relationship with Congress. “This is fiscal policy, picking winners and losers.”
And even though they would like to set broad-based criteria for who gets money, in the end their decisions will be subject to political review “in the extreme,” he added."
"April 11, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/04/10/sat-act-2021-coronavirus/,The Washington Post,"Dozens of colleges and universities are dropping SAT/ACT requirements for fall 2021 applicants, and some for longer","A record number of colleges and universities have in recent weeks dropped the requirement that students applying to enter as freshmen in fall 2021 submit an SAT or ACT test, and some are using it as a pilot to determine whether to eliminate the requirement altogether — actions that could presage a broad shift away from admissions testing in higher education.
Dozens of schools — including major universities and such highly selective schools as top-ranked Williams College and other major universities — have announced new test-optional policies for high school juniors as a response to the shutdown of most public life, in the United States and around the world, to try to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Each day brings new suspensions, and many more are expected in the coming weeks, admissions experts say.
There is a growing chorus of voices for even more schools to take such action. The student-led nonprofit group Student Voice is holding a news conference next week to urge every college and university in the country “to prioritize equity in the admissions process” and adopt test-optional policies for freshmen entering in 2021, according to a statement.
The test-flexible movement, which has been building for years, has grown exponentially this year, with concerns mounting about the value of a single test score and the fairness of using that score in admissions when all students do not have the same access to great teachers and test preparation. But the shift has accelerated since the pandemic hit.
Stay-at-home orders prompted the College Board and ACT Inc., which own the SAT and ACT exams, respectively, to cancel several administrations of the exams. As a result, schools started suspending the rule for 2021 freshmen in numbers never seen.
Some of the most selective liberal arts colleges in the country have suspended the testing requirement, including Williams, Amherst, Haverford, Davidson, Pomona, Rhodes, Scripps and Vassar colleges. Davidson, Rhodes and Williams, which routinely ranks as No. 1 in national liberal arts colleges on U.S. News & World Report rankings, are launching three-year pilot programs to test whether the requirement is needed at all. Vassar plans to review the matter next year to see whether to extend it. So is Trinity University, a liberal arts college in Texas.
A number of highly competitive universities have made similar announcements. They include the influential University of California system, which said April 1 that it would suspend its admission testing requirements for students seeking to enter in fall 2021. The UC system, with its renowned undergraduate campuses in Berkeley, Los Angeles and seven other locations, is a major force in public higher education.
Tufts University has announced a three-year pilot. Boston University plans to review their policies next year to see whether to extend it. Northeastern University, all public universities in Oregon, Texas Christian University and Western Michigan University are just some of the universities that have switched to test flexibility for 2021 because of the pandemic.
These bring the number of accredited, bachelor-degree-granting schools that have recently dropped ACT/SAT requirements for some period to more than 50, according to a list maintained by the National Center for Fair and Open Testing (FairTest), a nonprofit organization that works to end the misuse of standardized tests. In addition, some 45 schools have temporarily waived testing requirements for high school seniors applying to start college this summer or fall.
FairTest, which has been keeping records for years of standardized testing requirements at colleges and universities, says there are now more than 1,100 four-year colleges and universities that do not use the SAT or ACT to admit large numbers of bachelor-degree applicants. (You can see the full list here.)
Bob Schaeffer, interim director of FairTest, said the growing wave of schools moving to test-optional policies could be a turning point for the way colleges and universities assess the value of using test scores in admissions decisions in the future.
“The question is what will policymakers do about testing after the current crisis is over?” he said. “Will there be a knee-jerk restoration of high-stakes testing? Or will the fact that high-quality educational decisions continued to be made in K-12 and higher education without standardized exams persuade many to seriously review the evidence before they react? Assessment reformers hope that one positive consequence of this awful threat to human health will be a wholesale rethinking of the ways America evaluates students, teachers and schools.”
He also said that he thinks standardized testing suspensions — which have also occurred in K-12 schools — will have a more permanent impact in the area of universities.
“It’s a lot easier for admissions leaders at an individual institution of higher education to keep a well-functioning test-optional policy in place than to convince a majority of legislators (and, especially, the test-and-punish ideologues who support them) to vote to repeal testing requirements,” he said.
Zachary Goldberg, spokesman for the College Board, said in an email that “the health and safety of students is our first priority,” but also suggested that it was working on “innovative means to ensure all students can still take the SAT this fall,” even if schools can’t open because the pandemic has not subsided. He did not provide further details, but the College Board is already arranging for Advanced Placement tests to be taken at home in May or June if schools are still closed.
Edward Colby, spokesman for ACT Inc., said in an email that “ACT scores continue to be widely used in admissions, placement and scholarship decisions” and that even though “some institutions make temporary adjustments to their admission criteria to mitigate COVID-19 impact on applications and enrollment, we’re reminding students and colleges that ACT remains committed to benefiting them both.” He also said ACT was exploring new options for the test for the next school year, saying that “testing at home is one of the new test options that we are currently exploring and evaluating.”
Research has consistently shown that ACT and SAT scores are strongly linked to family income, the education level of the test-taker’s mother, and race. The College Board and ACT say their tests are predictive of college success, but there is also research showing otherwise.
The issue of elitism in college admissions was underscored by last year’s Operation Varsity Blues, a federal investigation into admissions fraud that resulted in the indictments of dozens of people, including wealthy parents and college coaches who prosecutors said created false records to secure admission to top schools. Actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were two of the better-known defendants.
Nearly 50 accredited colleges and universities that award bachelor’s degrees had announced from September 2018 to September 2019 that they were dropping the admissions requirement for an SAT or ACT score, but the pace of such decisions has rapidly increased this year.
This is Goldberg’s complete statement:
“The health and safety of students is our first priority, and we are collaborating with higher education institutions to provide flexibility to students and to support admissions under these unprecedented circumstances. We’re working to address testing access issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic and will provide additional SAT testing dates and increased capacity as soon as the public health situation allows. If, unfortunately, schools cannot reopen this fall, we’re pursuing innovative means to ensure all students can still take the SAT this fall. In every situation, we are committed to finding opportunities through which all students, especially low income students, can distinguish themselves in admissions.”
This is Colby’s complete statement:
ACT scores continue to be widely used in admissions, placement and scholarship decisions. As some institutions make temporary adjustments to their admission criteria to mitigate COVID-19 impact on applications and enrollment, we’re reminding students and colleges that ACT remains committed to benefiting them both.
ACT has already announced that we will be offering new test options, such as online testing and ACT section retesting, in the next school year as part of our national test dates. However, we are also currently exploring and evaluating new testing experiences, including remote proctoring for at-home testing, based on our online research and development. We are committed to supporting students’ needs for obtaining an ACT score during these trying times.
In addition, we are reminding students to continue to utilize a host of free resources ACT provides at www.act.org/covid19 [act.org] to help them prepare for test dates ahead and for success in college.
Here is FairTest’s list of colleges and universities with test-optional or flexible policies, as of April 10. The list is updated everyday on FairTest’s website."
"April 11, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/10/secret-service-has-protected-trump-family-members-4000-trips-three-years/,The Washington Post,"The Secret Service has protected Trump family members on 4,000 trips in three years","One of the most common criticisms of former president Barack Obama during his two terms in office was that he and his family took an exorbitant number of vacations. Donald Trump, then a private citizen, liked to use Obama’s trips as a critique.
Once Trump took office, his position on trips (and on Obama’s golf habit) shifted dramatically, though the rhetoric of many of his supporters didn’t. While the media tracked Trump’s regular trips to his privately owned properties in Florida and New Jersey, Trump’s supporters regularly defended Trump by pointing to the frequency and cost of Obama’s trips.
Data compiled by the Treasury Department shows the distribution of protected trips within the administration from 2010 to 2016. The figures, obtained and published by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, show that Obama, then-first lady Michelle Obama and their family took about 4,700 trips from 2010 to 2016. Just under 1,000 of those were for members of the president’s family, excluding Michelle. Most of the protected trips that were taken over that period were by former officials, including former presidents and their families.
(The Secret Service defines a protected trip as “any instance that an individual protectee spends time within the jurisdiction of a single USSS field office, other than the protectee’s home district.”)
The data obtained by CREW extended into Trump’s own term in office. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, members of the presidents’ family took 4,560 trips — the bulk of them in the past two years.
The data are collated in government fiscal years, which run from October through the following September, so the 2017 data include about four months of Obama’s presidency. Given that the number of trips by family members jumped from 121 in fiscal 2016 to 1,311 in 2017, it’s safe to assume that Trump’s family has gone on more than 4,000 protected trips since he took office.
There are several reasons that Trump’s family might require more protected trips than did Obama’s. For one, Trump’s children are older and more numerous. Obama’s two daughters were teenagers when they lived in the White House. Four of Trump’s children were college age or older when Trump took office. The Trumps also spend a lot of time traveling, including on official business for the Trump Organization and as surrogates for their father’s campaign and presidency. His daughter Ivanka, of course, is a member of the administration, along with her husband, Jared Kushner.
The distinction is nonetheless stark. Forty percent of the protected trips in 2019 were ones involving members of Trump’s family — again, as distinct from trips taken by Trump and first lady Melania Trump.

In the past two fiscal years, Trump’s family has gone on more than 3,200 protected trips, almost 50 percent more than the number of protected trips taken by former White House officials. The number of trips taken by Trump’s family in the past two fiscal years is more than three times the number taken by Obama’s family from 2010 to 2016. Trump, Melania Trump and his family took about 4,200 trips in fiscal 2018 and 2019 — about as many as Obama, Michelle Obama and Obama’s family took from 2010 through 2015.
Many of Trump’s own trips have been to properties he owns. In recent weeks, though, he hasn’t visited any Trump Organization properties. The coronavirus pandemic has led to the second-longest stretch of Trump’s presidency in which he hasn’t visited a golf course. (The longest stretch was during the government shutdown in 2018–2019.)
In August 2017, the Secret Service announced that without additional funding, its employees would be forced to work overtime without being paid.
As The Post reported at the time, “the cost of protecting the president and members of the extended first family, who have traveled extensively for business and vacations, has strained the Secret Service, local governments and at least one other federal agency, the Coast Guard.”
That, apparently, was just the beginning."
"April 11, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/10/weapons-sales-saudi-arabia-reveal-that-canada-is-willing-trade-jobs-its-principles/,The Washington Post,Weapons sales to Saudi Arabia reveal that Canada is willing to trade jobs for its principles,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to hold the world’s attention, Canada has decided to resume selling weapons to the butcher regime in Saudi Arabia. An April 9 release from Global Affairs Canada entitled “Canada improves terms of light armored vehicles contract, putting in place a new robust permits review process” stretches the limits of feel-good government double-talk, effectively stating that the country is willing to trade jobs for its principles, albeit with a bit more transparency and an “arms-length advisory panel of experts who will review best practices regarding arms exports.”
Well, that’s all sorted then. And never mind the timing. As journalist Martin Lukacs put it on Twitter, “Thursday afternoon before a four-day weekend in the midst of a global media-monopolizing pandemic… the perfect time for Liberals to announce they’ve green-lighted exporting more death machines to the Saudi dictators.”
I guess Canada is back, but hoping no one was watching.
Prior to this statement, Canada had put an indefinite hold on weapons exports to Saudi Arabia after the 2018 murder of journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The announcement of the renegotiated contract reiterates, “Under our law, Canadian goods cannot be exported where there is a substantial risk that they would be used to commit or to facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law, international human rights law or serious acts of gender-based violence.”
So what’s changed then?
In 2019, researchers Jeremy Wildeman and Anthony Fenton wrote, “[Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau’s Canada also appeared the polar opposite of a conservative kingdom infamous for denying women basic rights, such as the right to drive or travel without a male guardian’s consent. The infamy includes frequent use of the death penalty. Public beheadings and crucifixions are regularly meted out in cases of public protest, homosexuality and sorcery.” Around the same time, Amnesty International warned the world that Canadian military equipment was being used in the Saudi war against Yemen — a conflict that has brought about extraordinary suffering and loss, including widespread famine and the death of more than 100,000 people.
Last year, Global Affairs Canada disputed the claim that there would be “negative consequences” from Canadian exports of military equipment to the Saudi regime. Experts immediately pushed back. I know who I believe.
Canada’s inconsistency and two-faced treachery is maddening. But at least the ministers of foreign affairs and finance are saying the quiet parts loud. “We can confirm that the cancellation of this $14-billion contract — or even the mere disclosure of any of its terms — could have resulted in billions of dollars in damages to the government of Canada, with potential damages amounting to the full value of the contract,” they said in the release.
The ministers add, “This would have put the jobs of thousands of Canadians at risk, not only in Southwestern Ontario but also across the entire defense industry supply chain, which includes hundreds of small and medium enterprises.” So, the deal, shared with the country and the world under cover of the covid-19 pandemic, is death and destruction abroad in exchange for jobs at home.
I’d call it a Faustian bargain, but it’s far worse. At least Faust wanted knowledge; Canada already has knowledge. We know this is a bad deal with bad people sending dangerous weapons abroad that have a significant likelihood of being misused — or, rather, used as intended.
The government of Canada ought to be ashamed of itself for going forward with this deal. And Canadians ought to be ashamed of their government for doing so. There is no “if…” to append to this judgment, no “what about…”
The decision is wrong. The decision is immoral. The decision ought to be condemned. The decision ought to be reversed. And, in the meantime, Canadians ought to give careful consideration to the chasm between what Canada says it prefers, values and represents, and how it behaves when put to the test."
"April 11, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/10/when-you-drown-government-bathtub-people-die/,The Washington Post,"When you drown the government in the bathtub, people die","I had been expecting this for 21 years.
“It’s not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’” the legendary epidemiologist D.A. Henderson told me in 1999 when we discussed the likelihood of a biological event causing mass destruction.
In 2001, I wrote about experts urging a “medical Manhattan Project” for new vaccines, antibiotics and antivirals.
Reporting on a congressional briefing in 2005, I quoted public health experts predicting a pandemic that would overwhelm hospitals and exhaust respirator supplies. “I want to emphasize the certainty that a pandemic will occur,” the Mayo Clinic’s Gregory Poland said.
In 2009, during the swine flu scare, I relayed warnings about “the nation’s patchwork of a public health system” and the need for better “vaccine and public-health infrastructure before a more severe pandemic comes along.”
I repeat these things not to pretend I was prescient but to show that the nation’s top scientists and public health experts were shouting these warnings from the rooftops — deafeningly, unanimously and consistently. In the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the Bush and Obama administrations seemed to be listening.
But then came the tea party, the anti-government conservatism that infected the Republican Party in 2010 and triumphed with President Trump’s election. Perhaps the best articulation of its ideology came from the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, who once said: “I don’t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.”
They got their wish. What you see today is your government, drowning — a government that couldn’t produce a rudimentary test for coronavirus, that couldn’t contain the pandemic as other countries have done, that couldn’t produce enough ventilators for the sick or even enough face masks and gowns for health-care workers.
Now it is time to drown this disastrous philosophy in the bathtub — and with it the poisonous attitude that the government is a harmful “beast” that must be “starved.” It is not an exaggeration to say that this ideology caused the current debacle with a deliberate strategy to sabotage government.
Overall, entitlement programs continued to grow, and the Pentagon’s many friends protected its budget. And Trump has abandoned responsible budgeting. But in one area, the tea party types, with their sequesters, debt-limit standoffs and other austerity schemes, did all too well. Between 2011 and 2018, nondefense discretionary spending fell by 12 percent — and, with it, the government’s already iffy ability to prevent and ameliorate public health emergencies unraveled.
John Auerbach, president of Trust for America’s Health, described for me the fallout: Over a dozen years, the Public Health Emergency Preparedness grants to state and local public health departments were cut by a third and the Hospital Preparedness Program cut in half, 60,000 jobs were lost at state and local public health departments, and similarly severe cuts were made to laboratories. A $15 billion grant program under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the Prevention and Public Health Fund, was plundered for other purposes.
Now Americans are paying for this with their lives — and their livelihoods.
If the United States had more public health capacity, it “absolutely” would have been on par with Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, which have far fewer cases, Auerbach said. South Korea has had 4 deaths per 1 million people, Singapore 1 death per million, and Taiwan 0.2 deaths per million. The United States: 39 per million — and rising fast.
To have mitigated the virus the way Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan did would have required spending about $4.5 billion a year on public health, Auerbach estimates. Instead, we’re spending trillions to rescue the economy.
Democrats aren’t blameless in pandemic preparedness. And some Republicans tried to be responsible — but the starve-the-beast crowd wouldn’t hear of it.
After Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) voted for the 2009 stimulus bill because he secured $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health, he was essentially forced out of the GOP. Rising in the party were people such as Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), whose far-right Republican Study Committee in 2011 proposed a plan, applauded by GOP leadership, to cut NIH funding by 40 percent.
In 2014, NIH chief Francis Collins said there likely would have been a vaccine for the Ebola outbreak if not for a 10 percent cut in NIH funding between 2010 and 2014 that included halving Ebola vaccine research. Republicans jeered.
In 2016, when President Barack Obama requested $1.9 billion to fight the Zika virus, Republicans in Congress sat on the request for seven months and then cut it nearly in half.
Since then, Trump has proposed cuts to the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so severe even congressional Republicans rejected them. And last month they fed the “beast” a $2.2 trillion feast to fight the pandemic."
"April 11, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-attack-on-vote-by-mail-is-an-attack-on-democracy/2020/04/10/984e1d34-7a84-11ea-a130-df573469f094_story.html,The Washington Post,Trump’s attack on vote-by-mail is an attack on democracy,"“REPUBLICANS SHOULD fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting,” President Trump tweeted on Wednesday. Mail-in voting, he explained, “doesn’t work out well for Republicans.” The relevant question, though, is not whether mail-in voting would “work out” for Republicans, but whether it would work out for American democracy during the coronavirus crisis. If Mr. Trump has a better alternative, he should present it.
Public health experts continue to warn Americans not to leave the house unnecessarily, and certainly not to pack into a polling place with many other people. Tuesday’s disastrous election in Wisconsin provides a peek at what happens when Republicans “fight very hard” against mail-in balloting, the way Mr. Trump suggested. Wisconsinites who could not get absentee ballots had to decide whether to venture out to vote in person or listen to the doctors and epidemiologists counseling them to do no such thing. Election workers failed to show up, leading to mass polling-location closures. People who decided to risk their health had to wait in lines for hours. Many others were deterred. Milwaukee was particularly hard-hit, no doubt to the satisfaction of the Republicans who engineered the fiasco: state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. The likely upshot was to depress Democratic turnout in a state Supreme Court election.
Given the potential dangers of in-person voting, and the serious problems with online voting, a mass shift to mail-in voting is the most credible option during a time of social distancing. States such as Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii and (deep-red) Utah conduct all of their elections by mail. Though no system is immune from fraud, they have not experienced major problems with illegal voting. Electoral fraud of all types is extremely rare across the nation.
About 30 additional states allow people to vote absentee for any reason. Mr. Trump admitted that he voted in last month’s Florida primary by mail. No doubt many more voters will request absentee ballots in the coming months, a move that states should encourage by sending out mail-in ballot applications to all registered voters. States will have to work out some kinks, ensuring they have enough ballots to dispatch and machines to process them when they return. Some polling locations must be kept open for people without fixed mailing addresses or with vision problems. Simple measures such as ballot tracking can combat absentee ballot fraud. Yet the president insisted Wednesday that only groups that happen to be Republican-leaning, such as senior citizens and military voters, should be allowed to vote by mail.
The only alternative appears to be the Wisconsin model — that is, chaos — or postponing elections. Neither is a legitimate option, particularly come November."

The WHO has made mistakes in this outbreak and others, but it has also provided valuable guidance, resources and action. Mr. Trump and his GOP pals are looking for scapegoats to distract attention from the administration’s bungling.
At a White House briefing, Mr. Trump declared, “We’re going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it.” Then he said, “We’re going to look at it.” He said on Twitter, “The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look.” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James E. Risch (R-Idaho) declared the WHO “has become a political puppet of the Chinese government” and called for an investigation.
The United States has provided the WHO $893 million over the agency’s current two-year funding period, or 14.67 percent of its total funding. The WHO is constantly strapped for support, and its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, appealed to nations for more at the outset of the pandemic. Congress probably will not agree with Mr. Trump to hold back U.S. aid, but the president’s threat is counterproductive and diversionary.
The WHO seriously erred at the outset of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, in which 11,310 people were killed. Reexaminations of its performance then led to a greater emphasis on rapid response to outbreaks, among other issues. The agency did better in Congo’s Ebola crisis, which was complicated by violence and insecurity on the ground. When the coronavirus first surfaced, from December to late January, China misled its people and the world about the outbreak. In early comments, the director-general and other WHO officials were excessively positive about China’s performance. They should have been more cautious. The agency was probably attempting to protect its access to China, no small matter given how Beijing attempted to conceal the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The WHO has also mistakenly treated Taiwan poorly to stay in China’s good graces. All of these issues can and should be addressed in subsequent investigations.
But the WHO has been a mainstay of the global response, fielding diagnostic tests and providing information to countries that did not have them. The agency regularly is in the trenches fighting disease, including AIDS, malaria, measles and tuberculosis. The WHO’s work around the world also helps protect Americans from these scourges, and it would make sense after the pandemic to explore how global public health efforts can be expanded and strengthened. It certainly makes no sense to undermine the people who are helping the world navigate this storm."

Trump isn’t doing that.,"ENSHRINED IN law for four decades, the system that allows persecuted migrants to seek refuge in the United States has survived sustained assaults since the Trump administration took office. Now Mr. Trump, having weaponized a public health crisis to ignore long-established statutes, rules and procedures, has finally managed to crush it.
For the past three weeks, virtually every category of migrant without papers has been turned back at legal ports of entry along the southern border or expelled immediately upon apprehension by border agents; 10,000 have been thrown out so far in the crisis. They include minors who may have been trafficked and asylum seekers, individually or in families, who may face persecution in their home countries. Immigration courts are suspended, deportation procedures have been ditched, and due process is a thing of the past.
For years, President Trump has disparaged unauthorized migrants as disease carriers, with paltry evidence. Now he justifies the brutal measures, imposed March 21, by insisting that in the midst of a pandemic, migrants could ignite a “perfect storm” of contagion that would endanger border agents, the health-care system and the public. “Left unchecked,” he warned, they could even “cripple our immigration system” — the very immigration system he has tried by every means to dismantle since taking office.
The evidence for that is, so far, scant; a hundred times more people have tested positive for the coronavirus in the United States than in Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala combined — the countries of the overwhelming majority of migrants at the southern border. That adds weight to the suspicion that Mr. Trump, contemptuous of what he calls “the worst immigration laws ever,” is obliterating them through the legally dubious means of a health emergency measure enacted in 1944.
It is reasonable in the face of this pandemic to exercise extreme caution in screening those who are admitted to the United States, and even barring most foreign travelers from Western Europe and China, some of the world’s most ravaged regions. It’s a different thing to impose a systematic, draconian, extralegal regime, one never contemplated by Congress, whose effect is to ignore and override 40 years of asylum and immigration law.
Mr. Trump had severely tightened asylum procedures before the pandemic but had not, and could not, expunge the possibility that migrants with reasonable asylum claims could apply and be heard in court. Respecting those asylum procedures, like respecting civil liberties, presents few challenges during prosperity and peacetime. It is more difficult, and requires political courage, when the country is reeling economically, and on what amounts to a war footing, as it is today.
Yet it is precisely in times of emergency that any country faces its most severe tests — ones that call into question the nation’s essential character and values. It shames itself when it fails to live up to those qualities and values, as the United States did when it forcibly imprisoned more than 100,000 Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II. That is what Mr. Trump is doing now by betraying this country’s long tradition as a beacon to those fleeing oppression."
"April 13, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/five-step-plan-for-reopening-business-gets-a-test-run-in-china/2020/04/12/8c0bc17e-7acb-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,Five-step plan for reopening business is put to the test in China,"Employers and employees around the world are eager to get back to work as soon as possible. A picture of how that will unfold is starting to emerge — and it’s far from straightforward.
Businesses have long relied on a five-tier inverted pyramid called the “hierarchy of controls” to reduce workplace risks to employees, ranging from chemical exposure to physical injury. This framework will also be the basis for companies’ plans to get back to work, occupational safety experts say.
Companies in China have already begun following the hierarchy to restart production. But the process has been expensive and slow, as it is likely to be in the United States. That’s because many of the standard tools for workplace safety are ineffective against a risk like the novel coronavirus.
Distributing masks and nagging employees to wash their hands count among the more uncertain methods for ensuring employee safety, experts say. But these are largely the methods that Chinese companies have been relying on as they have restarted production — and American businesses may not have many better options.
Governments and companies face a difficult choice in coming weeks: They can either reopen business with layers of stifling and expensive hygiene controls or return to work with fewer controls and accept the risk of second-wave infections.
Either way, there is no silver bullet against further spread of the virus, and the global economy cannot sustain a lockdown until a vaccine is developed — which could take at least another year.
Susan Arnold, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health, said the most effective way — the top rung of the hierarchy of controls — to keep workers safe from a health risk is to eliminate it from the workplace. This is easy if the risk is a toxic chemical or dangerous machine, but it isn’t currently possible for the virus, she said.
“When we have a vaccine that’s widely available and accessible, then we will be in the position to eliminate that hazard from the workplace,” she said. “The only other way to do that right now is to shut workplaces down.”
As Chinese businesses return to work, Beijing has sought to reduce the transmission risk by requiring employers to check workers’ health and temperature daily, with quick quarantines for anyone showing symptoms. But some of the infected are asymptomatic, and test kits can produce false negatives, making these checks far from foolproof.
The next most effective method on the hierarchy of controls is to find a safer substitution. Again, this works when swapping out a toxic chemical for a safer one in a manufacturing process, but it is not applicable to covid-19, the disease the virus causes, said Kirsten Koehler, an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “In this case, we can’t swap one virus for another.”
That leaves the three rungs that workplace safety experts have long considered the least effective and most costly: engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment, or PPE.
Engineering controls, or redesigning workspaces to physically prevent virus transmission, are the next line of defense. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is recommending that retailers consider installing “sneeze guards,” or walls of plastic or glass, to protect cashiers. Companies should also consider adjusting production lines to provide more space between workers.
At many Chinese factory canteens, cardboard dividers have been set up on lunchroom tables to separate diners. Some factories also have placed mats soaked in disinfectant at entrances.
One engineering control is to improve ventilation, either through air filtration or introducing outside air, said Koehler.
Many of the measures that are easiest for businesses to adopt are administrative controls, which are safety protocols for workers to follow — for instance, frequent hand-washing.
Also included are work schedules that minimize employee crowding. Some Chinese Internet companies have returned to work in recent weeks on “AB shifts,” with two teams coming into the office on alternate days. ByteDance — the parent company of viral video clip platform TikTok — recently reopened its office in Wuhan on such a schedule, as has Chinese Internet search giant Baidu.
Koehler said factories may face limits in how much they can space out assembly lines, but they could at least consider leaving some time between shifts to minimize crowding.
The small, pointy base of the hierarchy of controls is personal protective equipment, which occupational safety experts consider the least effective method and the safeguard of last resort. The emergence of the term “PPE” as a household phrase in recent weeks reflects how the other four rungs have proved ineffective at stemming the spread of the virus.
There is growing international consensus that workers outside the health-care industry should also wear face coverings for protection, though there is also concern that scarce mask supplies might be diverted from hospitals if the general public scrambles for them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended the American public wear cloth face coverings, not medical-grade masks.
In China, some manufacturers like Foxconn have begun producing their own masks to ensure a steady supply for their assembly-line workers.
Arnold said employers should consider what they can do at each of these five levels as they prepare to reopen.
As for employees preparing to go back to work, she said: “Just be mentally thinking that any of my co-workers could still be potentially a source of exposure. Anything I touch could potentially be a source of exposure.”"

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce asked Congress for “urgent action” to replenish a $349 billion small-business relief program, which may run out within days. The nation’s governors, meanwhile, are demanding Congress provide half a trillion dollars in economic aid to plug revenue gaps.
Lawmakers are still scattered across the country, so getting something done this week would likely require unanimous consent in Congress -- a tall order in any event and harder still with party leaders themselves nowhere near agreement.
House Democrats announced Monday the chamber is not expected to return to Washington before May 4, rather than April 20 as previously scheduled, although members could be called back early if votes are needed on legislation related to the coronavirus.
President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell want to give the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program a $250 billion infusion and leave other issues for another stimulus package to be negotiated later.
Democratic leaders Monday reiterated their demands for changes to the small business loan program and aid for state and local governments as well as for hospitals in whatever Congress does next.
“Small businesses, hospitals, frontline workers and state and local governments across the country are struggling to keep up with this national crisis,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a joint statement. “They need more help from the federal government and they need it fast.”
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated Monday that the administration was sticking to focusing on the small business aid.He said at a White House briefing that there is an immediate need to add funding to the Paycheck Protection Program and if more needs to be done to support other areas of the economy the administration will work with Congress to accomplish that later, with a so-called phase four stimulus package.That could include money for infrastructure projects to put people to work, aid to hospitals and incentives for Americans that will bolster restaurants and other businesses, Mnuchin said.
The economy faces fierce headwinds that have leaders in both parties proposing massive additional spending. Some 17 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past month. By Monday evening, there had been more than 959,000 applications for the small business aid approved totaling over $232 billion, about two-thirds of the money available, according to the SBA.
“No family and no business should be bankrupted by the temporary economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic,” Chamber of Commerce President Suzanne P. Clark wrote in a letter to congressional leaders.
The shutdowns of businesses and the millions thrown out of work also are plunging state budgets into turmoil as revenue falls and expenses escalate. Governors want half a trillion dollars in economic aid, far more than even the Democrats have suggested so far.
“The Covid-19 response is resulting in catastrophic damage to state economies, and fiscal assistance is critical now so that we can continue leading this fight,” National Governors Association Chairman Larry Hogan, a Maryland Republican, said in a statement Monday. “Without sufficient federal relief, states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to essential services.”
Hogan said he spoke with Vice President Mike Pence in hopes of breaking the logjam.
The Senate had a brief pro-forma session Monday that was quickly adjourned without action, with the next such opportunity scheduled for Thursday.
Mnuchin, who brokered the $2.2 trillion rescue package that passed in late March, talked with Schumer and Pelosi, though there was no sign of a breakthrough.
Democrats want changes to the Paycheck Protection Program to focus more of the money on smaller banks and smaller businesses. They also want to allocate an additional $250 billion in aid to states and hospitals.
Republicans painted Democrats as obstructionists, saying their demands are blocking McConnell’s proposal for a quick addition of $250 billion to the PPP program.
GOP Representative Devin Nunes of California said Saturday on Fox News that Democrats want it loaded up “with a lot more junk.”
Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Saturday the small-business money would be depleted by Friday.
The political risks of delay will ramp up once the money is gone, given that millions of businesses -- particularly smaller ones -- risk getting left out as banks prioritize their best customers. Many small businesses are on the brink, or worse.
Given that dynamic, an eventual deal appears all but certain. But to do it this week, lawmakers will have to find a way to bridge the partisan split so that legislation can be approved by unanimous consent.
Even if the leaders agree, any one senator or House member can force days of delays or even roll call votes, which as of now must be conducted in person despite the risk of spreading infection. Objections are all but certain unless both parties can get at least some of what they want.
So far, the machinations are a near replay of what happened a few weeks ago, when McConnell held multiple votes on the Republican stimulus proposal while negotiations between Schumer, Mnuchin and top White House legislative liaison Eric Ueland continued in private.
Give and Take
Those talks, which included input from Pelosi, ultimately added hundreds of billions of dollars to what was then the third rescue package, swelling it to about $2.2 trillion and yielding an historic 96-0 Senate vote.
A wish list of ideas from Pelosi and her progressive wing helped give McConnell a political foil to keep his troops in line, while oversight provisions and the extra spending on assorted Democratic priorities -- including a vastly expanded unemployment insurance program and $150 billion for states -- appeased liberals.
One key difference is that last time, senators were in town and McConnell had convened bipartisan task forces that had hammered out much of the bones of the legislation over multiple days, with buy-in from key senators.
There was no such bipartisan give-and-take last week. And getting a complicated, multi-part package like the one Democrats are demanding will be challenging with most lawmakers out of town and talking to each other via conference calls.
In addition to this interim infusion, both sides have been talking about a larger follow-on package. But exactly what that will entail remains up for debate."

Trump, the Republican National Committee and their joint fundraising committees have now raised more than $1 billion toward his reelection campaign, and entered April with more than $240 million in their accounts, officials said Monday, announcing their figures ahead of upcoming federal filing deadlines.
In comparison, former president Barack Obama, the Democratic Party and their joint fundraising operation raised about $127 million in the first quarter of 2012, according to data from the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute.
The Trump campaign and joint committees raised more than $63 million in March alone, for a total haul of more than $677 million, they said. The committees raised $60.5 million in January and $86 million in February, and the new figures suggest fundraising dropped off in March.
Trump has had a fundraising advantage as the incumbent, and began raising reelection money far earlier than any of his predecessors. Party officials said Trump’s fundraising operation has gone completely virtual amid the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 880,000 volunteers making more than 17 million voter contacts since March 13.
“Americans can see President Trump leading this nation through a serious crisis and they are responding with their continued enthusiastic support for his re-election,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. “Joe Biden, Democrats, and the media continue to oppose his every action, but the people know that President Trump is fighting for them so they are fighting for him as well.”
Biden has raised at least $121 million so far. As the presumptive Democratic nominee, he and the Democratic National Committee can strike an agreement to jointly raise money for the general-election campaign and close the money gap with Trump and the RNC. By this point in the 2012 campaign, presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney had begun his own joint fundraising operation.
DNC officials said Monday that they do not yet have official plans for one, saying in a statement: “We will have conversations with the campaign and figure out the best path forward that puts our nominee in the best position possible in order to beat Donald Trump.”
Biden posted his strongest monthly fundraising record in February of $18 million, and aides said the campaign raised $33 million in the first two weeks of March, when donors consolidated around his candidacy after most of the other Democrats ended their bids.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) suspended his campaign last week, leaving Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee to challenge Trump."
"April 13, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/13/oil-texas-oklahoma/,The Washington Post,Texas and Oklahoma weigh production quotas for oil,"Now that Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to cut oil production, dragging the other countries belonging to the so-called OPEC Plus group along with them to some extent, Texas and Oklahoma will have to decide whether to follow suit.
President Trump hailed Sunday’s agreement to halt the Saudi-Russian price war, declaring Monday that the cuts worldwide will amount to much more than the advertised 10 million barrels a day, even as many analysts expect them to be considerably less.
Trump has said American oil production also will decline because of market forces let loose by the coronavirus pandemic and that the U.S. government will not impose quotas on producers — an act it doesn’t normally have the power to do anyway.
That’s not true for the states.
The Texas Railroad Commission regulated the quantity of oil production from the early 1930s to 1972, and on Tuesday it will consider a petition brought by two Texas producers to “prorate” oil production in the state once again. A similar appeal was filed with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission on Friday. Last month, North Dakota, another major oil-producing state, suspended a regulation that limited the amount of time wells could be inactive, in hopes production would fall without imposing quotas.
Proponents argue that the steep fall in prices — West Texas Intermediate traded for about $23 a barrel Monday — and demand for oil could bankrupt scores of producers and allow the oil majors to consolidate control of the American industry. Oil services companies already have laid off thousands of workers nationwide.
“We want to keep this industry alive and well, and it’s struggling today,” said David Little, head of Kingery Energy in Ardmore, Okla.
Opponents of prorationing, including the American Petroleum Institute, Marathon, Occidental and Chevron, argue that the government should let the marketplace determine oil production and not try to manipulate output.
The market already responded “flexibly and appropriately,” and prorationing could lead to “a precarious and slippery slope,” wrote R. Dean Foreman of API in a comment to the Texas commissioners. He also suggested Texas production alone isn’t big enough to make a difference.
“It’s naive to say we need a free marketplace in oil — there’s never been such a thing,” countered Mike Cantrell, of Cantrell Investments in Ada, Okla., and a member of the Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance, which is asking the state to impose controls.
Citing the “monumentous” events of the past month, he said in a conference call last week that “we just need to make sure we have an American industry that’s as preserved as we can preserve it.”
The two Texas petitioners are Pioneer Natural Resources, of Irving, and Parsley Energy, based in Austin.
“This crisis, aggravated by government actions around the globe, calls for appropriate government measures to mitigate the economic consequences,” Mark Berg, executive vice president of Pioneer, wrote to the Texas Railroad Commission. Taking note of the steps to end the price war abroad, he then wrote, “For leadership from the United States to be most effective, however, Texas — the world’s fourth largest oil producer — must step forward as well.”
Berg has an ally in Harold Hamm, head of Continental Resources, based in Tulsa, and someone who appears to have Trump’s ear.
Landowners who collect royalties also would rather see cheap production cut back, calculating that the oil is worth more for now in the ground.
Judy Stark, president of the Panhandle Producers and Royalty Owners Association, endorsed the proposal to prorate and noted that many of the problems afflicting the Texas oil business predate the covid-19 pandemic and Saudi-Russian price war. She called on the commission to set up a proration system that would curb the tremendous loss of natural gas because of flaring at the well heads in Texas — enough gas to supply the entire residential demand of the state, according to some estimates.
She was joined in this by several environmental groups.
Ryan Sitton, one of three commissioners on the Texas Railroad Commission, said: “I have not advocated for Texas to prorate. I have advocated that we consider it. I felt that we should be open to evaluating any path that helps to bring the international oil community together in a global deal. ”
Sitton said while he has advocated for the state to “take a lead role in this conversation, I still have many reservations, and I will be examining heavily if and how proration could be done.”
Both state commissions are empowered to act to reduce “waste,” and naturally this has led to arguments about what constitutes waste. Stark and her allies say it’s flaring of gas. Some oil producers say the commissions should act to make sure that as storage capacity everywhere fills up, excessive oil won’t needlessly be pumped — and therefore wasted. Production should be moderated to meet demand, they say.
They argue it’s not about propping up prices but apportioning the remaining business fairly.
Others are overt about their motivations, especially as the price producers are getting for oil has dropped as low as $7 a barrel in Oklahoma, said Dewey Bartlett, head of the energy producers alliance. It reportedly dipped even lower in North Dakota. (The prices usually quoted for oil reflect what traders pay on global markets, not what producers receive.)
“The drilling and production of oil at these prices,” said Joe Warren, of Cimarron Production, of Oklahoma City, “constitutes economic waste.”
But regulating production would introduce “uncertainty” for investors and induce them to seek opportunities outside Texas, which produces 43 percent of American petroleum, wrote Douglas J. Suttles, chief executive of the Ovintiv oil company. “We respectfully submit that proration is not required to mitigate waste; waste is already addressed by strong market forces.”
The Baker Hughes company reported last week that the number of working rigs in the United States had fallen by 62, or 10 percent, in the previous month.
Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said last week that he expects U.S. oil production to fall by 2 million barrels a day, or more, by the end of the year, as a reaction to market forces. Some analysts have said that’s understating it. Global demand is down by an estimated 25 to 30 percent from the beginning of this year — considerably more than the 10 percent cut in production that the OPEC Plus producers hammered out.
“No one’s driving, no one’s flying, no one’s on a cruise ship,” said David House, of Kizer Creek Energy in Tulsa. “We need to get our state to act in the best interests of the state.”
Offshore oil producers along the Gulf Coast are seeking relief on royalty payments to the federal government. Erik Milito, head of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore producers in the Gulf of Mexico, urged Trump on Monday to “utilize his full policy toolkit, including offshore royalty relief and lease extensions.”
The Trump administration already has dismissed the idea of a blanket royalty waiver for offshore drillers. But Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), chair of a Senate subcommittee on energy, said Interior Secretary David Bernhardt promised his department would do “targeted royalty relief” for companies that applied for it. Interior Department spokesman Conner Swanson said Monday one offshore producer has begun the process of requesting relief."
"April 13, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/13/bernie-sanderss-endorsement-joe-biden-is-marriage-necessity/,The Washington Post,Bernie Sanders’s endorsement of Joe Biden is a marriage of necessity,"Former vice president Joe Biden announced a news conference on the coronavirus with a “special guest.” He made a few remarks referencing President Trump’s dereliction of duty in failing to prepare for the covid-19 pandemic. He then introduced his special guest: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who offered a full-throated endorsement of Biden. “I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,” Sanders said. He added, “We’ve got make Trump a one-term president.”
They then embarked on a somewhat stilted conversation in which Biden praised Sanders repeatedly, calling him the strongest voice on issues such as wage inequality. “You’ve been the most powerful voice for a more fair and just America,” Biden gushed. (When Biden began, “You do not get enough credit for . . . ,” Sanders broke into a grin.) Sanders asked questions for which he knew the answer (e.g., Do you support a $15 minimum wage?) so Biden could affirm to Sanders supporters that, yes, he shares the same goals as Sanders (e.g., higher wages, student loan relief, transition to a green economy). They announced a proposal to set up “task forces” to address issues including on the economy, education, immigration, criminal justice reform and climate change.
The cessation of hostilities was made possible, in large part, because of the friendly relationship between the two, and because of the Biden camp’s extreme solicitousness in refusing to call for Sanders to get out of the race. Both plainly wanted to avoid a repeat of 2016, when the animosity between the Hillary Clinton and Sanders camps lasted all the way to the convention.
Biden also took the opportunity to appeal to Generation Z — a core base of support for Sanders — by offering free state-college tuition and community college to the middle class, for example. They acknowledged that they had differences on issues without specifically mentioning Medicare-for-all, but the effort was to present a show of unity, however contrived.
The event underscored some key considerations for the Biden camp. First, Biden’s team has bent over backward to make certain Sanders’s supporters have no reason to oppose Biden or drag their feet getting behind the campaign. Second, for all the talk of task forces and common ground, Biden cannot afford to actually move to the left during the general election. He presumably knows this, so expect the task forces to put some pretty packaging around Biden’s agenda. And third, the media event actually underscores how progressive Biden’s platform has been from the beginning. He did not need Sanders’s help to support a $15 minimum wage, a robust green energy plan, easing rules for unionization, sick leave and workplace safety for workers, access to legal and safe abortions, LGBTQ rights and a slew of other items. The difference between the two is that Biden is willing to look for the common ground, move one step at a time and avoid scaring voters. That is, in large part, why Biden is the presumptive nominee and not Sanders (along with his record as vice president).
Sanders deserves credit for getting the basic question right: Do you want to deprive Trump of a second term? (“You believe in democracy, and so do I,” Biden said with Sanders nodding along.) With the stakes as high as they are, Democrats and the country at large should be grateful that Biden graciously gave Sanders a route to withdrawal and endorsement — and that Sanders obliged."

It’s a problem for everyone.,"Michele L. Norris wrote in her April 9 Thursday Opinion essay, “Black America is squarely in the bull’s eye,” about the disproportionately negative effects that covid-19 is having on African Americans. As she said, covid-19 is “not an equal opportunity disease.” Blacks make up a large proportion of those affected by the disease, and the pandemic is having severe impacts on their families and communities. This is shocking to many, even President Trump, who mentioned at one of his news conferences that he did not know why African Americans are more likely to contract the disease.
However, decades of research and clinical observations have shown that minorities make up a disproportionate share of the population with chronic illnesses, which places them in jeopardy of contracting other illnesses. Health-care experts need to inform the president. This crisis should serve as an impetus for federal, state and local governments to be equipped with adequate budgets to eliminate or lessen the effects that health-care disparities have on the most vulnerable groups.
I trust that the next president will take up this charge and rebuild our public health infrastructure with the resources necessary to address health-care disparity as one its highest priorities.  
Michael Gerson’s April 7 op-ed, “Coronavirus presents a crisis for Africa. We have a duty to help.,” acknowledged that President Trump, whose governing precept is “America First,” “lacks the ideological tools and personal empathy” to respond. Our duty to Africa is not just a moral imperative. A pandemic out of control anywhere can lead to a renewed outbreak everywhere, including in the United States."
"April 14, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nursing-homes-are-in-the-pandemics-crosshairs-they-cant-be-neglected/2020/04/13/7341919a-7db0-11ea-a3ee-13e1ae0a3571_story.html,The Washington Post,Nursing homes are in the pandemic’s crosshairs. They can’t be neglected.,"FEWER THAN half of 1 percent of Americans reside in nursing homes, but they account for roughly 3,600 coronavirus deaths, more than 15 percent of the 22,000 in the United States as of Monday, according to a tally by the Associated Press. More than 85 percent of those deaths have occurred in the past 10 days — and that may understate the actual numbers given that many nursing home patients die without ever being tested for the pathogen. In addition to the nation’s 1.3 million nursing home residents, nurses, orderlies and other workers at the facilities are also at heightened risk.
In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) is sending “strike teams” to nursing homes composed of doctors, nurses, health officials and National Guard members who will administer speeded-up tests; ensure segregation of confirmed and suspected covid-19 cases; determine equipment needs; and provide on-site care and medical assessment.
Mr. Hogan’s move is far more proactive than most governors have managed, but it is late in the game given the devastation that has already befallen nursing homes in Maryland and nationwide. Forty infected residents of a facility near Richmond have died; 37 from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Wash.; 18 at a nursing home in Carroll County, Md., northwest of Baltimore. In the New York City area, where the pandemic has beset virtually every nursing home, some distribute disposable ponchos to staff who lack proper protective gear, and refrigerator trucks acting as makeshift morgues are idling in some facilities’ parking lots.
Federal guidance issued last month recommended that nursing homes bar nearly all visitors and volunteers, scrap communal dining and other group activities, and screen residents and health-care staff for fever and respiratory symptoms. The stark reality is that in a crisis there is no way to monitor compliance at the nation’s more than 15,000 nursing homes, and quality control varies considerably from facility to facility. At best, states could follow Mr. Hogan’s lead as a means of enforcing quality control.
In the end, the burden will be on nursing homes themselves to improvise in an emergency in the face of staffing shortages and hundreds of other challenges that have overwhelmed them. They will need to communicate transparently with patients, relatives and officials. There can be no tolerance for homes that instruct workers not to wear protective gowns or masks for fear of alarming patients, as some have, or continue to blithely assure relatives that all is well even after the disease has broken out in a facility. More useful communication would convey specific information on mitigation efforts under way to contain the outbreak.
Unlike in some other parts of the world, relatively few elderly Americans live with their children and grandchildren. Many are out of sight, but that cannot be license to disregard and neglect them — still less in a pandemic whose particular lethality has fixed the elderly, more than anyone, in its crosshairs."
"April 14, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-historic-oil-price-truce-wont-last/2020/04/12/f635505c-7c82-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,The Washington Post,The Historic Oil Price Truce Won’t Last,"After four days of high drama, low farce and long periods of tedium, the OPEC+ group of countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, finally agreed to a record cut in their oil production in response to the coronavirus-triggered collapse in demand. But the deal will come under pressure when the world becomes a more normal place again.
The drama was provided by Mexico refusing to accept its allotted cut. The farce followed when the country’s oil minister left the virtual OPEC+ meeting to hold separate talks with her U.S. and Canadian counterparts, while the other energy ministers agonized for hours, and then for days, over how to respond. The tedium? Well, that was just the bits in between.
Mexico was asked to cut 400,000 barrels a day of production in the first phase of an OPEC+ deal that would run for an unprecedented two years. It offered one-quarter of that, and from a slightly higher baseline than what was asked for.
An unlikely white knight appeared to ride to the group’s rescue on Friday in the form of U.S. President Donald Trump. He proposed an arrangement with Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as AMLO) in which 250,000 barrels a day of the “market-driven” decline in U.S. output would be rebranded as “Mexican.”
But don’t be fooled: That wouldn’t have taken a single additional barrel of oil off the market beyond those that would disappear anyway because of the Covid-19-prompted collapse in demand. Eventually, after nearly four days of trying to persuade the Mexican government to budge, the Saudis and the Russians finally decided to cut their losses and swallow Mexico’s lack of genuine commitment. The alternative would have been to allow the commodity markets to open on Monday morning with the group still in disarray and to risk another big price slump.
In fairness, the OPEC+ deal is historically grand in its scope, given the size of the cuts and their duration, although it’s questionable how much value there is in setting targets two years hence, when so much remains uncertain. The 20 producers taking part will initially cut output by 9.7 million barrels a day, with all but Mexico reducing production by 23% for two months — May and June. As it stands now, Mexico’s cuts will end with the first phase of the deal, when it will presumably have to leave the OPEC+ group. The reduction for the remaining 19 countries will taper to 7.7 million barrels a day until the end of the year, and then to 5.8 million barrels for another 16 months, until April 2022.
Don’t be surprised if the headline numbers published by OPEC+ are even bigger than these. There has been some suggestion that the official figure could be closer to 12.5 million barrels a day, but that would be achieved by raising the starting production numbers for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, who have all boosted production this month, leaving their real targets unchanged. This is smoke and mirrors to try to make the cuts look even more substantial.
The deal raises some even bigger questions than Mexico. Russia, for example, is to cut its output by 2.5 million barrels a day over the next three weeks. Really? Igor Sechin, head of state-controlled oil company Rosneft, was a fierce critic of Russia’s modest contribution to previous reductions. I can imagine how he’ll react when he’s told his company has to cut output by almost 1 million barrels a day by May 1.
The contribution from Friday’s meeting of G-20 energy ministers — which followed Thursday’s marathon OPEC+ call — was, to put it mildly, underwhelming. India’s minister mentioned filling the country’s strategic oil reserve, but there were no concrete new offers from the group. With oil prices on the floor, building up reserves makes sense anyway, and China and India have already started. But storage space is limited.
The U.S. has room for another 77 million barrels in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but Congress refused last month to approve the budget for an initial 30-million-barrel purchase. Oil traders and analysts estimate that China could buy an extra 80 million to 100 million barrels this year. Meanwhile, the Indian government is asking state-run refiners to buy 15 million barrels of crude from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq to fill its tanks. Beyond those three countries, there’s little storage capacity elsewhere.
U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told the G-20 meeting that the oil market collapse will impose some 2 million barrels a day of American output cuts by the end of the year without any government intervention. Some predictive models, he added, see the drop as big as 3 million barrels. Russia previously rejected such “free market” cuts, arguing that production falling in response to a lack of demand is not an output reduction. But in the end it capitulated, along with the other OPEC+ countries. There was no mention in the OPEC+ communique of the deal being dependent on the actions of anyone else outside the group. Other non-OPEC+ producers, including Canada, Brazil and Norway have also contributed “market-driven” output cuts.
This is the second time in less than five years that Saudi Arabia’s attempt to pursue a pump-at-will policy has collapsed. After just one month, this one has lasted an even shorter time than the previous effort, brought to an end by the OPEC+ deal with Russia and other countries toward the end of 2016.
But these are quite clearly extraordinary times, with an unprecedented demand collapse. Don’t be surprised if the war over market share between the Saudis, the Russians and the Americans resumes once the lockdowns ease and people want oil again. This is a temporary truce rather than lasting peace between the three biggest producers."

What happens after the virus passes is a different story. The strength or weakness of the country’s rebound, whenever that comes, will be heavily influenced by actions taken today and over the coming months.
Economists pointed to three crucial areas they say will matter most. For one, the speed with which small and mid-sized business aid finds its mark. A second, the level of support for states and cities later this year. And third, something -- anything -- to restore public confidence in getting back to life, and business, as usual.
A clean, so-called V-shaped recovery may be unrealistic, but effective steps on each of those fronts could help make the difference between an energetic bounce-back and a recession that is long-lasting, or even catastrophic.
“Where we are headed in the long run can be shaped, with unusual effectiveness, by policy decisions that are happening right now,” said Kartik Athreya, director of research at the Richmond Fed.
The unprecedented nature of the current contraction makes it almost impossible for forecasters to tell us how bad it’s going to get. Their models, after all, rely heavily on documented historical experience. No surprise then that forecasts span an eye-popping range. Estimates for second-quarter annualized GDP growth submitted to Bloomberg since April 10 range from -65% to 0.4%.
Economists are even more powerless when it comes to issuing any prescription for improving the short-term outlook. With public health the priority, policy is focused on temporarily smothering activity that drives whole sectors of commerce.
To its credit, the federal government has made significant stimulus available. Congress in late March appropriated more than $2 trillion to beef up unemployment benefits, send direct aid to lower and middle-income households, offer grants to small businesses and provide bailouts for airlines and other big firms. President Donald Trump swiftly signed the legislation into law.
Even more funding for small businesses is currently being discussed by lawmakers. The Federal Reserve has also announced a barrage of new emergency lending programs capable of mobilizing trillions more.
But what’s desperately needed now is the rapid disbursement of cash. And so far, more than three weeks after the first stay-at-home orders were issued, very little money has been delivered.
Rocky Start
The Paycheck Protection Program -- created to hand out $349 billion to small companies through loans that convert to grants if a company retains or rehires its workers -- got off to a rocky start. The White House said April 9 that $128 billion of loans had been processed. But very little, if any, of that money had actually been disbursed.
The Federal Reserve is preparing a separate program, the Main Street lending facility, that will make $600 billion in loans available to small and mid-sized companies. But even as officials revealed details of the scheme on April 9, they couldn’t give any timetable for when it might open.
Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said Friday that getting the loans to mid-sized U.S. businesses through the Main Street lending program is two-to-three weeks away.
Juice Company
“There’s going to have to be a certain tolerance of imperfection” in getting aid programs running, said David Wilcox, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “They cannot afford to be cavalier or haphazard, but they do need to recognize the urgency of the situation because economic dreams are being shattered on an daily basis.”
Shizu Okusa and her employees at the Washington D.C.-based bottled juice company Jrink could be an example. Okusa has closed her brick-and-mortar outlets and laid off 30 of her 38-member staff as revenue collapsed by 80%.
On April 3 she applied for a $170,000 PPP loan that will let her rehire her staff and pay rent and other bills. Her bank, EagleBank, said they might be able to approve the application and release funds this week. But maybe not. Okusa is already exploring options -- including the possibility of a merger or sale.
“It’s like you’re about to board a plane, and you’re all hovering around the entrance waiting to board, but they’re not letting you in,” Okusa said.
Every business failure represents a miniature blow that rolls forward.
Suppliers and vendors lose future revenue and laid-off workers cut back on spending, further reducing demand across the economy. That can create what Columbia University’s Glenn Hubbard, a former chief economist to President George W. Bush, has called a “demand doom loop.” Without large rapid government intervention, it could trigger a Depression-like downturn, he said.
States, Cities
Past the fire wagon stage, Congress will have another chance to heavily influence the pace of the eventual recovery by bailing out cities and states, which are headed for major budget shortfalls as tax revenues plummet and corona-related spending rises. Without help they could be forced to make draconian cuts to spending and jobs.
That’s what happened after the recession of 2007-09, contributing to the tepid recovery.
“The State and local government component is going to be critical because so many states have balanced budget amendments,” said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities LLC and a former Treasury official. “Any way to prevent contractionary fiscal policy, whether federal or state or local, is going to help differentiate the recovery after this recession from the last one.”
Third Challenge
The third challenge may be harder to address. Even if the novel coronavirus doesn’t flare up again in the autumn or next year, the fear of its re-emergence may cause dramatic and long-lasting changes to social behavior, and by extension to economic activity.
The Great Depression cast a shadow on the saving and spending habits of millions of Americans for decades. Even the Great Recession of 2008-09 had a documented impact. The current crisis could go deeper.
“This is not just a threat to your economic livelihood, it’s a threat to your health,” said Peterson’s Wilcox. “It’s going to affect behavior in more dimensions than I can begin to imagine.”
Rebuild Confidence
That in mind, steps that rebuild public confidence in normal activities will be central to restoring economic normalcy. The best solution will come with a vaccine, estimated to take another 18 months. In the meantime, other new medical therapies may reduce anxiety.
Athreya at the Richmond Fed said government officials might also help by establishing new safety regimes aimed specifically at business sectors that have been hit the hardest.
He suggested, as one example, the Centers for Disease Control might publish a set of best practices for restaurants that could reduce the risk of new transmissions. Restaurants could then post a notice saying they have complied with the CDC guidelines.
“We need to have a regime in place, something credible, to give people confidence in communal consumption,” he said."

It’s bad. But it’s only paper. The Japanese conglomerate faces a far more tangible problem as the value of portfolios plummet and credit ratings get slashed. The issue is cash. Specifically, at the $100 billion Vision Fund.Most venture capitalists  operate by taking in money from limited partners and throwing it at speculative investments, and then distributing the results (less fees) as those startups sell out or list. The fund does all that, but it also has a curious side deal that allowed it to raise such a large pile.
Approximately $40 billion of its money came in the form of preferred equity, requiring managers to pay a 7.5% annual dividend. That’s $3 billion that must be paid out every year, no matter how the underlying portfolio performs.
Ordinarily, we’d expect a steady flow of stock listings — like Uber Technologies Inc., Slack Technologies Inc. and the We Co. — to feed that cash-hungry beast. But the fund’s initial public offerings have so far been lackluster, and the WeWork disaster compounds the lack of cash flow.
Other promising startups, such as Grab Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd., may one day bear fruit. In the current coronavirus market environment, it’s unlikely they’ll churn enough profits to get IPO investors excited, which means the companies are likely to be left in the oven to cook a little longer.
For now, that’s not a problem. The Vision Fund, not SoftBank, last year took out a $4.1 billion, three-year loan led by Mizuho Financial Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS Group AG and Saudi Arabia’s Samba Financial Group. Yet with the fund almost fully spent and major exits of holdings unlikely in the coming year, the ability to keep paying the dividend isn’t guaranteed. It’s also unclear whether margin calls need to be met on this loan, and whether the plunge in fund value would trigger them. It’s another cloud over SoftBank’s cash needs.
A likely scenario is that the Vision Fund will once again find bankers willing enough to front the required money, but one would expect (hope) they’d ask for some collateral to back it up and charge a hefty enough interest rate to make it worthwhile in these unstable times. If any  new loan is structured to invoke margin calls, the fund could ill-afford further paper losses.
While I don’t think SoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son would like to, there’s also a chance that the Vision Fund may sell  or collateralize its assets to shore up cash. SoftBank has already announced plans to do just that for itself — a move that spurred Moody’s Corp. to cut its debt rating — but the fund’s own cash needs can’t be ignored. This would look a lot like another firesale.
The final thing to consider is that even if it the fund can manage to borrow enough cash to pay those dividends, and it can continue to service such loans, and it doesn’t face margin calls, and the sun again shines on the IPO market, those multiple years of $3 billion dividend checks will take away from eventual profits.  
The upshot is that for all of Son’s crowing about investing in the coolest tech that will change the world, the future of the Vision Fund really hangs on the ability of bankers to cobble together enough cash to keep it running."

Steve Holland, Reuters: “There’s a debate over what authority you have to order the country reopened. What authority do you have on this one?”
Trump: “Well, I have the ultimate authority.”
— Exchange at the briefing
At a coronavirus news briefing Monday, Trump said he could order hunkered-down states to reopen their economies. He claimed to have the “ultimate authority” on such decisions and that his authority was “total.”
This will be a short fact check, because the president of the United States is not a king.
The Facts
After declaring independence from Britain and shaking off the yoke of King George III, the Founders of the United States adopted a system of government in which power would be split between the states and a centralized federal government.
The federal government has enumerated powers that it cannot expand, but the state legislatures are free to adopt powers not explicitly forbidden by their constitutions or the U.S. Constitution, according to Robert F. Williams, an expert on state constitutional law at Rutgers University Law School in Camden, N.J.
The 10th Amendment says, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
James Madison wrote in the Federalist 45: “The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.”
The federal government’s powers, Madison wrote, “will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce.” The states, he wrote, would have power over “all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.”
Which brings us to covid-19. Many states have adopted stay-at-home orders to mitigate the spread of the virus, but the economic costs have been steep and millions of people have lost their jobs amid the lockdown. Trump says he has the “ultimate authority” to decide when states reopen for business. But a variety of governors and legal experts say he’s wrong.
“This is basic federalism — the role of the states and the role of the federal government,” said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.). “We don’t have a king in this country. We didn’t want a king, so we have a Constitution and we elect a president. … All other powers remain to the states.”
The moment the president declares a national emergency, as Trump did for covid-19 on March 13, many limits on presidential power can be set aside. But not all limits. There doesn’t appear to be any constitutional provision, federal statute or court ruling that allows Trump to override the emergency actions taken by the states. Like the federal government, states also have strong emergency powers in their body of laws, especially to protect public health and safety. The stay-at-home orders in place operate under those laws.
“The President has no formal legal authority to categorically override local or state shelter-in-place orders or to reopen schools and small businesses,” Stephen I. Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor, wrote on Twitter. “No statute delegates to him such power; no constitutional provision invests him with such authority.”
The Supreme Court has reinforced the separate roles of the states and the federal government multiple times. The court ruled in 1992 that the federal government cannot force states to run federal programs, what’s known as the “anti-commandeering doctrine.” In 1997, a court majority ruled that parts of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act violated the 10th Amendment because it was a federal law requiring state and local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on people attempting to purchase handguns.
Trump said at the briefing that “numerous provisions” in the Constitution gave him power over the states. The White House did not respond when we asked for an explanation.
The Pinocchio Test
The vast authorities bestowed on the U.S. president don’t include the power to micromanage states’ public health actions in an emergency.
Trump claimed to have “total” authority over the states and the “ultimate authority” to decide when they will reopen their businesses. But he couldn’t point to any law or constitutional provision backing up that assertion, and the White House did not respond to our query.
Meanwhile, a variety of legal experts and governors say he’s wrong. Madison’s writings, the text of the 10th Amendment and the Supreme Court’s rulings on the issue also run counter to Trump’s claim. He earns Four Pinocchios."
"April 15, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/hedge-fund-managers-are-claiming-bailouts-as-small-businesses/2020/04/14/dbe0f098-7e36-11ea-84c2-0792d8591911_story.html,The Washington Post,Hedge Fund Managers Claiming Bailouts as Small Businesses,"Free money.That’s the enticing prospect hedge funds and other trading firms are pondering after realizing they too might be able to participate in a historic U.S. stimulus package to keep small businesses alive through the coronavirus pandemic.Since early April, law firms have hosted Webinars and sent out alerts, and accounting firms have reached out to clients, all with the goal of explaining how they might be able to tap into the Paycheck Protection Program. The $349 billion package administered by the Small Business Administration provides loans to cover payroll, rent and utilities for up to eight weeks. The loans can convert to grants if recipients retain or rehire their workers.Some hedge funds already have applied, filling out forms to show they have fewer than 500 employees and certifying the “current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations.”
Ironically, hedge funds are designed to employ as few people as possible so star traders don’t have to share millions of dollars in fees. The industry gets its name from the premise it can generate gains even when markets fall.
The question of whether to partake in the program is dividing members of the money management community. Some traders have called it morally corrupt, while others insist they are small businesses -- just like hair salons, restaurants and dry cleaners -- that could use a helping hand after global markets tumbled and cost them money. Given that the program is first come, first served, some managers were quick to submit their paperwork, according to market participants, even if eligibility remains unclear.Donald Motschwiller, head of First New York, a trading firm that runs $2.9 billion in assets, said he was still deciding whether to request money that could be used to pay employees, including a receptionist and office manager, who are still on the payroll even though, with everyone at home, they essentially don’t have jobs to do. He canvassed about 15 hedge funds in his circle, from small managers to multibillion-dollar firms, “and no one has said ‘no’” to the possibility of taking the loan, he said.
Scaramucci’s Defense
The industry’s most prominent firms probably have no interest in the program, but it might make sense for money managers to apply if they are just starting their businesses and gathering capital, said Anthony Scaramucci, owner of SkyBridge, a firm that farms money out to hedge funds.
“Just because the business has a name, private equity or hedge fund manager, doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re loaded with rich people,” he told MSNBC in an interview earlier this month. Some are in their 20s and scared, he said.The chatter among money managers has grown loud enough to prompt a warning last week from Aksia, which advises institutional investors on placing money with hedge funds and other alternative investment firms. The firm said it would view any opportunistic use of the program “negatively” when counseling pension funds and other institutions with about $160 billion to invest.A manager with a healthy business who takes advantage of a program that isn’t “precisely defined, is not only showing poor moral judgment and potentially hurting the reputation of the alternatives industry, but it’s also probably crowding out struggling workers and businesses severely impacted by Covid-19,” Aksia said in the memo.
‘Complete Abomination’
Some lawyers have cautioned their clients that they may yet be disqualified. While the rules make clear that banks and insurance companies aren’t eligible for the small-business loans, the guidelines are murkier regarding hedge funds and proprietary trading shops. The Treasury and the Small Business Administration could yet come out with clearer policies that prevent those firms from participating. Representatives for those departments either didn’t immediately respond to messages or had no immediate comment.
One manager, who asked not to be named, said he was outraged when he received a note from his accountant analyzing his potential eligibility. Why, he asked, would a hedge fund that collects management fees, and can make money if it’s skilled, avail itself of a government handout?“It’s a complete abomination,” agreed Nate Koppikar, a partner at San Francisco-based money manager Orso Partners. He noted that firms that avail themselves of the money may later be publicly identified under the Freedom of Information Act.
A spokesman for former Vice President Joe Biden, the expected Democrat presidential nominee, shared similar sentiment.
“Leave it to the Trump administration to execute a program meant for America’s small businesses in a way that instead gives relief to hedge fund managers who don’t need it -- while mom and pop shops are forced to wait in line,” spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. “The Trump administration has shown its hand: their priority is to take care of the wealthy and well-connected as fast as possible and with as few conditions as possible.”
The Managed Funds Association, the hedge fund industry group, also came out against using the loans, though somewhat less stridently.
“While we recognize that every manager must make their own decision about the viability of their firm, we have provided guidance to our members that we do not believe the money in this program was intended for managers general partnership interests,” Bryan Corbett, president and chief executive of the organization, said in a statement."

Again, The Post has not told readers an important aspect of a shooting that anyone interested in reducing gun violence (i.e., the majority of Americans) would like to know: Whose gun was used in both murders? And, was the gun owner (or seller) held responsible in any way? 
This two-time murderer who pleaded insanity for the first killing was released from St. Elizabeths Hospital after 17 years. How did this person obtain a gun? The April 10 report of U.S. coronavirus deaths set the number at about 18,000. But this year there will probably be more than 36,000 gun deaths (and 100,000 gun injuries), according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
If we could dedicate a fraction of the media coverage given to the pandemic to the sources of gun violence and publish the names of the self-described “responsible” gun owners and sellers who are a major cause of such tragedies, perhaps we would finally get effective legislation from the federal government. But we need the media to pursue this. Will it ever happen?"
"April 15, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/04/14/obama-video-biden-endorsement-president/,The Washington Post,"Obama gives Biden his endorsement. He should really give him his lighting, that set and his camera.","It did not look like a hostage video, which has become the cinematography standard for far too many of the Democrats during this presidential election cycle. Former president Barack Obama endorsed former vice president Joe Biden in a 12-minute video released on social media Tuesday, managing to be intimate and formal, biting and urgent. He was helped along by impeccable framing, flattering lighting, a pitch-perfect set and a powder blue, open-collar shirt that was more neighborly and genial than a politician’s all-business white one.
Obama’s statement was cogent and precise. He praised Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, and thereby extended an olive branch to his supporters. It was not Obama in full soaring rhetoric; he was relaxed and low-key. It was just right for the medium, which means it was just right for this election, which will be virtual for the foreseeable future.
Virtual campaigning through social media is not new, but it’s now all there is. Communicating with voters is no longer a matter of how eloquent a candidate might be. It’s heavily dependent on whether he can get the lighting right, keep the background from being impersonal but not distracting and dress in a manner that’s just right for his home office as well as your living room.
It’s no easy feat, and it’s Biden’s challenge.
The endorsement video opens with a close-up of Obama offering his concern and condolences as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic. He settles into his thoughts before he gets to Biden. Obama never mentions the current president by name, but he briskly lays out his negative assessment.
The tight focus on Obama’s face makes the tone more conversational and less like a speech; but it also gives his words a sense of importance. Obama had the advantage of being able to practice his remarks. He’s not being forced to speak off the cuff. But he also must hold his audience’s attention without the benefit of cutaways to video clips or a PowerPoint graph. He’s just talking and asking people to listen.
He’s aided by the setting. The room is creamy white, and there are bookshelves in the background. There are pictures on the shelves, as well as mementos. Awards, maybe. A basketball, definitely. But it’s all a bit blurry. It’s spread out. You can see that things are there and they create a sense of place and personality, but they aren’t distracting. They give the eye a place to go for a brief respite, but you always return to him.
This is stagecraft for your mobile device. It has been tough for Biden to get it right. All too often in his online campaign videos, there’s just too much stuff behind Biden. Or some ill-placed object that draws focus. The lights are too hot. There’s a reason Realtors tell home sellers to declutter before putting their property on the market. People need air, space, oxygen in a room before they can get a clear picture of what’s for sale.
Most of the other former Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed Biden. Some did it from the stage of a rally — back when campaigns were all about handshakes, back-patting and selfies. But Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) offered her endorsement in a video. It looked as though she’d recorded it in an alley at dusk. It was disconcertingly sterile even though it was shot with the informality typically reserved for FaceTiming with a relative.
Making a video look light and breezy while the candidate comes across as articulate and compelling is hard work. (Just trying not to look like a shiny zombie on Zoom is a high hurdle.) Professionally, it’s a little like producing a fashion shoot in which the models all look perfectly natural — as if all they’re wearing is a little lip balm and mascara, a perfect white T-shirt and faded jeans, and tousled hair. No one wakes up like that. It takes a village.
The rules of campaigning have abruptly changed. Being good on social media isn’t just a bonus, it’s mandatory. It’s not superficial or vain to know which is your good side, whether red makes you look ruddy and how you’re best lit. It’s essential.
It’s important to be natural. Conveying that to the public requires a good bit of artifice."
"April 15, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/airlines-failing-in-covid-19-era-fail-to-refund-passengers-as-required-lawsuits-say/2020/04/14/5addf26c-7e7b-11ea-8013-1b6da0e4a2b7_story.html,The Washington Post,"Airlines, besieged in covid-19 era, fail to refund passengers as required, lawsuits say","A lawsuit filed against Southwest Airlines alleges the carrier violated its contract with customers by failing to provide refunds for flights canceled during the coronavirus pandemic.
In the suit, traveler Adrian Bombin says that when Southwest canceled his trip from Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport, via Florida, to Havana last month, he asked for a refund.
And, as has happened to many other travelers, Bombin said in the federal lawsuit filed Monday in Pennsylvania, the airline would offer him only a voucher.
The suit points to language in Southwest’s contract with customers, which says the airline in such situations would put customers on the next available flight or refund their fares “in accordance with the form of payment utilized for the Ticket.” It alleges Southwest violated that contract for Bombin and seeks class-action status to represent everyone Southwest has failed to refund since March 1.
“We’re not trying to ask them to do anything special because of covid. We’re only asking them to honor the agreement they wrote,” said Bombin’s attorney, Hassan A. Zavareei.
Other airlines, including United and Spirit, have also recently been sued under similar circumstances.
Southwest said in a statement that it offers “customer-friendly policies” and that people “may request a refund to the original form of payment.”
“Southwest will review this complaint and will defend our policies accordingly as our focus is always on taking care of our Customers, especially during these unprecedented times,” the airline said.
United said in a statement that “eligible travelers on both domestic and international flights” can request a refund “if their flights have been severely adjusted or service to their destination suspended either due to government mandates or United schedule reductions related to COVID-19.”
The airline said at one point it was providing credits to customers, but is now “providing refunds as outlined above and people who were provided credits can request for those to be converted into refunds.”
The Transportation Department said earlier this month that it has been receiving “an increasing number of complaints” from passengers being denied refunds, despite airlines’ “long-standing obligation” to provide them when they cancel flights or make significant changes to schedules.
“The focus is not on whether the flight disruptions are within or outside the carrier’s control, but rather on the fact that the cancellation is through no fault of the passenger,” the department said.
In a statement Tuesday, the department said it will monitor airlines’ refund practices and may issue warning letters or fines “as necessary.” But for now, it said, it is using its discretion “to give airlines an opportunity to come into compliance.”
A group of nine senators sent letters to airlines March 31 saying the “ongoing pandemic is placing enormous financial strain on millions of Americans, and families need cash to pay for essentials such as food, housing, and medical care.
“In light of this pressing need and the unprecedented bailout — to the tune of $25 billion — that the airline industry just received from Congress, we believe your company has a moral responsibility to provide real refunds, not travel vouchers, to consumers,” the letter read."
"April 15, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-world-will-reopen-when-is-not-the-right-question-to-ask/2020/04/14/cb6ffe98-7e8b-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html,The Washington Post,The important question isn’t when the government is going to lift restrictions. It’s this.,"Someday, the world will reopen. Someday, you will attend birthday parties, cash paychecks, go to church, take vacations.
You know that, of course. What you want to know is when.
I suspect it’s the absence of a when that makes people so impatient with the lockdowns. If authorities would give us a certain date, we could plan. Without it, our quarantines seem to stretch, unreasonably, into eternity. That’s when our mouths start to form the words: “I can’t do this anymore.”
Unfortunately, we’re not trying to make it to a particular date, but to an unknown day when the coronavirus is under control. So the only answer a responsible policymaker can offer at this point is “We’ll reopen when it’s safe.”
Yes, I can hear you crying, but when will that be? Unfortunately, I can’t give you a when. But I can offer you a why and a how.
Why we’ll lift the restrictions is clear: We’ll do it because the virus can be controlled by less-stringent means. Which brings us to the how: We’ll relax when, in addition to mask-wearing and scrupulous hand-washing, three new conditions are met.
First, the viral transmission rate must fall until, on average, each infectious person isn’t infecting one other person. In epidemiological jargon, the reproduction rate (R0, or R-naught) of covid-19 must fall below 1.
However, the R0 is partly a function of how many others a sick person comes into contact with. Right now, it’s not many, which is why the epidemic seems to be slowing. Unfortunately, if we all go back to acting as though it’s Jan. 15, the R0 will soar back above 2, and our exertions will have been for nothing. So we’ll want to err on the side of being a little late rather than too early, because too early gives us the worst of both worlds: nasty recession combined with lots of fatalities.
Getting the timing right also means having the public health infrastructure ready to keep new infections low by identifying new cases, tracing everyone they’ve been in contact with and isolating those people, too.
So our second criterion is the capacity to do widespread surveillance (of viruses, not people). That probably means a combination of policies: making covid-19 testing, for both active infections and antibodies, a standard part of medical care; setting up random testing programs in every sizable community; and making voluntary testing easy and free. We’ll need not just lots of swabs and reagents and lab equipment, but also people to do the testing and explain the results.
Third, we must be able to act on positives swiftly: quarantine not just the sick person but also everyone they’ve come in contact with, so that the virus doesn’t have the opportunity to spread.
Technological solutions, such as apps that detect when another phone is near yours, can help. But we’ll have to build and staff a whole new public health infrastructure to track people down and notify them about exposure. We should also explore providing voluntary quarantine centers where the mildly ill can pass their isolation pleasantly without infecting roommates or family. Luckily, we seem to have a lot of fairly nice surplus hotel rooms at the moment.
When the number of new cases has fallen, and we have the tools to keep it low, we can start to gradually lift restrictions — for example, allowing restaurants to reopen at half their normal capacity, or reopening schools but keeping kids to a single teacher in a single classroom. This will have to happen in fits and starts, relaxing some restrictions, carefully watching for signs of outbreaks and tightening up again where necessary.
That’s probably not what you were hoping to hear. What you wanted me to tell you was that in a few weeks, at most, you could go back to your old life. But the government didn’t take your old life; the virus did. The government can’t give it back, except by containing covid-19.
So the important question is not “When is the government going to lift the restrictions?” but “When is the government going to have the testing and tracing infrastructure that can let us go about our lives without being afraid?” For those of us who are sick of just sitting at home and waiting, a third question might be even more important: “How can I help the government do what it needs to?”
Two answers to that question: “By supporting politicians who propose solutions instead of days on the calendar” and “By staying close to home now, without complaining or cheating even a little, so that we can all knock R0 down to size as quickly as possible.”
If we all come up with the same answer, and act on it, we can probably start coming out of our shells in the next month or so. Better yet, we might avoid having to retreat back to them almost as quickly as we came out."
"April 15, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-voter-motivation-in-wisconsin-has-republicans-worried/2020/04/14/431df23e-7e77-11ea-a3ee-13e1ae0a3571_story.html,The Washington Post,Democratic voter motivation in Wisconsin has Republicans worried,"John Carter, 71, stood in line for three hours last week to cast his ballot for Jill Karofsky, the liberal candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Carter, a retired bus driver from Milwaukee and African American Democrat, said he wanted badly to oust conservative Justice Daniel Kelly. And he wanted to send a message to President Trump and state Republicans, who pushed for in-person voting despite the threat of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
“I saw the line and thought, ‘Oh my God,’ ” Carter said. “’But I have to vote. I must stay here.’ That’s why so many people stood in those lines. They wanted change. They’re looking for a change.”
On Monday, Karofsky claimed a surprisingly decisive victory, defeating the Republican incumbent by 11 points. She was propelled by thousands of motivated Democrats, who were angered by GOP insistence on going forward with the election amid the pandemic — seen by many as a way to suppress turnout and boost the conservative candidate in an obscure state court race.
The mobilization of these voters could signal a warning to Republicans in a state that will be key for Trump in the fall.
“There’s no question in my mind that Democrats are more motivated to vote than Republicans,” said Mark Mellman, a D.C.-based pollster who has done work for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D).
A number of Republicans said too many factors were at work last Tuesday to draw conclusions about November, notably the presence of a competitive Democratic presidential primary. Scott Walker, a former Republican governor, said in an email that November turnout will be twice as large as it was last week. It’s a “completely different model,” he said.
But some Republicans said the results show a worrisome enthusiasm gap.
“I was surprised at the turnout in the Democratic primary. It was more than what I thought it would be,” said Brandon Scholz, the former chairman of the Wisconsin GOP. The results reminded him how much Democrats hate the president, he said, and what a motivating force that could be.
Although November “will be different,” Scholz said, “a cautionary note should be sounded.”
Democrats are also delighted — and Republicans worried — about the geographic sweep of Karofsky’s victory. She dominated not only in the states’ two liberal strongholds, Milwaukee and Madison, but also in its suburbs and even some of its rural areas.
Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette University Law School poll, said the results underscored how changing voting patterns have increasingly cut into Republican margins in suburban counties around Milwaukee.
“Wisconsin has been a little slow to join the suburban shift that other states have seen earlier or bigger, but we are seeing the markers of that,” he said.
Kelly carried suburban Milwaukee counties but by reduced margins from historical norms. “Our suburbs have been deep, deep red,” Franklin said. “They still are red, but by a smaller and smaller margin.”
Meanwhile, Karofsky won small majorities in three counties in the Fox Valley that have long favored Republicans. Franklin attributed the changes there to ever-stronger support for Democrats in the cities of Green Bay, Appleton and Oshkosh, which are surrounded by strong Republican rural areas.
Something else caught Franklin’s eye. Karofsky swept the counties in the state’s southwestern area, which included several that had voted for President Barack Obama in 2012 but shifted to Trump in 2016.
Andrew Hitt, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said Democratic turnout was much higher than on the Republican side because of the presence of a Democratic presidential primary on the ballot and an uncontested primary for Republicans. He predicted that turnout will be much more even in November.
“Hats off to Democrats for convincing Bernie to stay in the race to help Jill Karofsky,” Hitt said, referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who conceded the Democratic nomination to former vice president Joe Biden the day after the Wisconsin primary. “I don’t know how they did it, but clearly that’s what they did.”
Keith Gilkes, a Republican strategist and longtime Walker adviser, said Trump’s strength in the northern part of the state remained solid, and he senses lack of real enthusiasm for Biden. But he noted that the Trump campaign cannot take for granted support from Republican suburban women and even some Republican suburban men.
“It’s always a good warning for the Republican Party,” he said of the primary results. “I think it’s meant to help keep us on our feet. . . . This isn’t a gimme state and it just fuels our toss-up nature.”
Democrats who accused Republicans of trying to suppress turnout by going forward with the elections in Wisconsin said the GOP should abandon that strategy elsewhere.
“This election took voter suppression to the most dangerous level possible,” said Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. “You were forcing people to choose between their own safety and health and their fundamental right to vote. That is such a cynical ploy.”
And it didn’t work, Perez added. More than 1.5 million Wisconsinites turned out to vote, either in person or by mail — more than any of the spring elections of the past three years.
“The average Wisconsin voter saw that, and saw right through it, and they made their voices heard,” he said.
An additional factor may have been at work last week, and that was an infusion of money from Democratic groups keen on flipping Wisconsin back to their column in November. Among them was the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, the group founded by former Obama attorney general Eric Holder to target Republican governors, legislators and judges who could stand in the way of his fight against partisan gerrymandering of political districts.
Holder’s group gave about $220,000 to support Karofsky’s campaign, including $50,000 to a grass-roots group in Milwaukee called BLOC — Black Leaders Organizing for Communities.
That group’s activity, combined with Republican insistence on going forward with voting even though Milwaukee was able to open five voting locations out of the usual 180, helped spur high turnout, Holder said.
“It’s an indication how you can spend a relatively small amount of money and have an impact, a grass-roots impact,” he said, adding: “Republicans will act at their peril, both the president and people at the state level, if they employ tactics to deny people the opportunity to vote in a way that is safe for them and safe for their communities. I think that will drive turnout up. They will find ways to vote.”
Angela Lang, the founder of BLOC, said one of the group’s great successes was orchestrating a dry run for the fall election, teaching voters how to vote by mail and forging relationships that will last through the cycle. The group made nearly 35,000 calls and sent nearly 82,000 texts in Milwaukee, Lang said.
“People didn’t know that requesting an absentee ballot was an option,” Lang said. “We gave them a crash course in understanding the different ways to vote.”
In the end, about 70 percent of voters cast ballots by mail in last week’s elections — up from a typical number of less than 15 percent.
Franklin, the pollster with Marquette University, offered an additional caveat that makes direct comparisons with November’s presidential election more difficult: Trump himself was not on the ballot, and his ability to draw his voters out is considered one of his strongest assets.
But the patterns that helped decide the Supreme Court race worry Republicans nonetheless. The shifts were evident in the presidential races of 2012 and 2016 as well as in the gubernatorial elections of 2014 and 2018. In all cases, the Republican suburban strongholds were beginning to erode.
Said Gilkes, the GOP strategist: “I don’t think this is going to be an easy win in any way shape or form.”"

The president’s claim, first conveyed in a tweet Monday morning and underscored at a White House news conference and subsequent social media posts, caught his aides off guard and prompted them to study whether Trump would have such authority in a time of emergency like the ongoing pandemic.
Republicans were largely tepid in their criticism of Trump’s expansive views on his power, which he has wielded throughout his presidency as he circumvented the legislative branch on matters of spending and subpoenas, while enjoying decisions in which he maintained universal authority such as issuing pardons. Trump has also issued a multitude of executive orders while relying heavily on myriad acting administration officials rather than subjecting them to the Senate confirmation process.
At a White House briefing late Tuesday, Trump offered conflicting statements about which entity had the authority to reopen, seeming to backtrack from his claim Monday but at the same time insisting the federal government would have the final say.
“The governors are responsible. They have to take charge,” said Trump, who added that some states want to reopen now and probably can before May 1, while others aren’t there yet. He said that if a state with many cases tries to reopen early, the federal government might step in.
“If we disagree with it, we’re not going to let it open,” he said, before adding, “We’re there to help. But we’re also there to be critics.”
Earlier in the day, Trump’s comments on reopening the nation were challenged by his presumptive Democratic rival this fall, former vice president Joe Biden, and also by prominent governors overseeing the public health crisis in their states such as New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who in his daily news conference Tuesday skewered at length Trump’s position as wildly off-base from the Constitution.
Cuomo said the president’s claim of total authority is “not an accurate statement,” because the basic principle of federalism is enshrined in the Constitution, in which powers not given to the federal government remain with the states.
“The statement that he has total authority over the states and the nation cannot go uncorrected,” Cuomo said. “There are many things that you can debate in the Constitution because they’re ambiguous. This is not ambiguous.”
Later Tuesday in his own remarks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) was less pointed toward Trump but nonetheless unequivocal, tweeting: “When it comes to reopening, SCIENCE — not politics — must be California’s guide.” Newsom outlined six factors he will consider in doing so, including protecting communities from the spread of the virus and ensuring that hospitals could handle any surge in cases.
The fresh power struggle between the federal government and state officials came as the toll of the pandemic continued to grow, with more than 25,000 people dead from the virus in the United States and more than 600,000 confirmed to be infected.
The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the pandemic is causing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It is also inflicting acute pain in the medical sector, which continues to struggle with supplies and personnel becoming sick, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying Tuesday that 9,000 health care workers have tested positive.
In another assertion of authority, Trump said he would halt funding to World Health Organization while a review was conducted. He has criticized the organization for its slow response in the early days of the outbreak, but by Jan. 30, the organization declared a global health emergency, after which the president continued to play down the outbreak and compared it with seasonal flu.
Governors also began outlining their strategy for reopening their states in the coming weeks and months, while a consortium of seven East Coast states continued a plan to explore how and when to lift restrictions in their geographically aligned states.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) was among the state leaders who made clear Tuesday that the facts on the ground must dictate when the current restrictions can begin to ease.
“This monster is still going to be with us at least until we get a vaccine,” DeWine, who has said his state has had a good working relationship with federal officials so far, said at a Tuesday news conference. “It’s not going away, and that’s the sad news. . . . We are 12-18 months away from this going away. We’re going to have to live with it..”
Two White House officials said there was no broader planning for Trump’s comments that he had “total” authority and that they were both surprised by his tweets to that effect Monday. There was no legal underpinning for the remarks in advance, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly, and “it is widely viewed with skepticism in the building that we should be doing this.”
The White House Counsel’s Office is studying what authority the president actually does have during a national emergency, according to the officials. But the operating plan in the White House is not to try to force any state to reopen, although one senior White House official said they had been in contact with some states — such as Texas, Mississippi and Tennessee — about reopening sooner rather than later.
“I am almost positive James Madison fell off a cloud somewhere today when Trump said that,” said Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor. “The founders of the republic stitched together a complicated game of chess to ensure our president was a very weak king who could be simultaneously slowed down by the legislature, judiciary and federalism. His authority is far from total.”
Another prominent GOP donor, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said there was an effort “to talk him into a better place.”
One official said Trump is frustrated that the governors are getting so much credit and no blame while he gets all the blame and none of the credit. He particularly complains about Cuomo, this official said.
“Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc.,” Trump tweeted earlier Tuesday. “I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!”
Trump has said repeatedly that the federal government is merely a backup to the states and that the onus is on the governors to deal with the pandemic.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said in a recent interview that “at the end of the day, it will be the governors that make these decisions.”
One Republican ally close to the president said Trump did not initially want to be associated with decisions to close down the government because “closing is bad news, and opening is good news.” And he spoke with governors such as Florida’s Ron DeSantis (R) who were skeptical, said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.
Trump was happy to accept the argument from some advisers that he should invoke federalism, and the president repeatedly emphasized states’ rights when questioned by reporters in recent weeks why he was not instituting a national stay-at-home order. But he sees a political triumph in reopening the economy and wants credit for it, this person said.
In a tweet Monday, Biden said that he is “not running for office to be King of America.”
“I respect the Constitution,” Biden said. “I’ve read the Constitution. I’ve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country’s governors — Democratic and Republican — are doing under these horrific circumstances.”
Within the GOP, Trump’s biggest challenge to his exertion of executive power came last year, when a dozen GOP senators voted to reject an emergency declaration the president issued to take taxpayer dollars from the military and other accounts for a border wall that Congress had denied.
Of that dozen, two — Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) — issued comments Tuesday, both stressing that states should retain the power to regulate their own activities. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said in a statement: “I respect the authorities of the office of the presidency. I also recognize that it will take all of us — elected leaders and citizens — to effectively stop the spread of this virus.”
A spokeswoman for Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) pointed to his remarks from a Fox Business interview earlier Tuesday in which he said the matter was not just up to elected officials “deciding when it’s time and coming up with some arbitrary deadline,” but the science and whether people feel safe leaving their homes.
Aides to two others — Utah Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee — said the senators would have no response. None of the other six responded to requests for comment. They were Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Roy Blunt (Mo.), Susan Collins (Maine), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Roger Wicker (Miss.).
At least two other prominent elected GOP lawmakers, past and present — Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking leader among House Republicans, and Republican-turned independent Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) — challenged Trump’s notion.
Cheney, whose father, Richard B. Cheney, had pushed for broad executive authority as vice president in George W. Bush’s administration, cited the text of the 10th Amendment in a tweet: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
But other GOP lawmakers questioned about Trump’s bold claim, an assertion refuted by constitutional experts, were reluctant to challenge the president.
Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the No. 2 House Republican, argued in a Fox News interview Tuesday that states had largely taken their cue from Trump and the federal government over the past two months, particularly when it comes to social distancing guidelines.
“When the president said that, you saw almost every governor in the country take that cue and say, ‘Okay, we’re going to institute a new set of policies,’ ” Scalise said. “And so, while the president hasn’t said every state has to do this, he’s been setting the guidance using the experts from CDC and other agencies, and then you see states following suit.”
A spokesman for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Tuesday declined to comment beyond the governor’s remarks to CNN on Monday in which he said governors were best positioned to make the ultimate decision on when their states can safely resume everyday activities.
“It’s not my understanding of the Constitution,” Hogan said in the CNN interview of Trump’s interpretation of his own powers."

Those predictions weren’t nearly pessimistic enough.
Both JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. posted their highest loan-loss provisions in a decade, setting aside more than $12 billion to cover defaults across the economy, but especially from credit-card borrowers and oil companies. Banks faced criticism in the last crisis for being slow to recognize the coming pain, and Tuesday’s results show they intend to avoid that this time.
“This is the reality check,” Credit Suisse Group AG bank analyst Susan Katzke wrote after JPMorgan’s results. “More to come.”
JPMorgan’s profit fell 69% to the lowest in more than six years, even as the firm’s traders seized on record volatility to deliver their best quarter ever. Wells Fargo posted earnings of 1 cent per share, down from $1.20 a year earlier.
“If we can help the country get through this, everybody’s better off. If we lose a little more money in the meantime, then so be it,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on a call with analysts. “We’re adults, we know that if the economy gets worse, we’ll bear additional loss. We know we can handle really, really adverse consequences.”
Shares of both banks slipped in New York trading at 11:58 a.m. as the broader market rose, with optimism the pandemic is slowing driving up the S&P 500 more than 2%. JPMorgan slumped 3.7% and Wells Fargo was down 4.4%.
“I’m surprised all the bank stocks are down,” said David Donovan, who leads the Americas global financial-services practice for Publicis Sapient, which helps set strategy for banks. “I’m surprised the Street didn’t foresee the fact that all of these banks are going pump up their loan-loss reserves. That’s just good business.”
Boosting Reserves
JPMorgan set aside $8.29 billion for bad loans, more than double what many analysts expected. That was on top of a $4.3 billion increase in total reserves that the bank had previously announced, prompted by a new accounting standard this year known as CECL, which requires banks to set aside provisions earlier in a cycle. Wells Fargo’s $4 billion provision was also well beyond expectations.
The reports give a first glimpse of what’s likely to come as the rest of Wall Street reports results this week. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are set to report Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley coming a day later.
Banks are also grappling with lower interest rates that will likely mean a slump in lending revenue at the same time that slowing economic activity causes loan losses to spike.JPMorgan cut its full-year outlook for net interest income -- revenue from customers’ loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors -- by $1.5 billion to $55.5 billion, while Wells Fargo stopped providing an annual forecast for the figure.
While the provisions were eye-popping, the first quarter didn’t actually feature significant pain. JPMorgan’s net charge-offs fell from the fourth quarter, and Wells Fargo’s nonperforming assets were lower than they were a year ago.
Tough to Gauge
Still, banks tried to anticipate how the global lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus would affect businesses and consumers. JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said the firm would likely add more to reserves in the second quarter after boosting them by more than $11 billion in the first quarter, but the bank is still trying to gauge what government relief programs will mean for defaults.
“We haven’t actually seen the stress emerge,” she said on a call with analysts. “What we took in the first quarter was our best estimate of future losses.”
Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said the bank doesn’t see anything in its loan portfolio right now that would force it to boost reserves in coming quarters.
“But if confidence does deteriorate and the shelter-in-place orders stay on for longer, which is possible, it wouldn’t surprise me that loss estimates would have to go up,” Scharf said on a call with analysts.
Scharf said economists are still struggling to forecast the trajectory of unemployment rates and gross domestic product, saying there’s no clear path on what’s to come.
Banks also have to determine how many lending commitments will turn into funded loans as companies tap previously unused revolving credit facilities. Scharf said commercial clients had tapped $80 billion of loan commitments just in March. JPMorgan said customers had drawn more than $50 billion of existing revolvers and were approved for $25 billion in new credit in March.
U.S. banks have maintained that they are much better positioned for this crisis than in 2008. JPMorgan’s key capital ratio was 11.5%, within its medium-term target range. Wells Fargo’s was 10.7%, above its internal target.
“We like to be conservative in reserving,” Dimon said. “Plan for the worst so you can handle it.”"

When he and his colleagues in one of the nation’s three busiest corporate bankruptcy venues switched to video hearings, they adopted a more informal approach that doesn’t include their tradition-bound courtroom attire.
“The judges all talked about it and we decided that was unnecessary and sort of silly if you are at home,” Sontchi said in an interview.
Dispensing with formalities is just one of many coping mechanisms deployed by the U.S. bankruptcy system during the coronavirus pandemic.
Judges across the country have pushed off non-urgent cases and big law firms are gearing up for a wave of multibillion-dollar cases. The U.S. Trustee program, which oversees the bankruptcy system, has canceled tens of thousands of in-person meetings between debtors and creditors, installed 1,200 new conference lines and added 250 attorneys to specialize in small-business cases.
The result, say those in charge, is a system that is more prepared today than it was during the last major default crisis that pushed so many consumers and companies into bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crash.
“I think we are better positioned to deal with the roller coaster today than we were years ago,” said Clifford White, director of the U.S. Trustee program, who oversees 360 government attorneys who are vital to helping consumers and businesses navigate the bankruptcy courts. “We have learned from experience.”
While big, corporate reorganization cases ticked up in March compared with a year earlier, overall, fewer businesses and consumers filed for court protection that month, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. The dip in smaller cases will likely reverse itself in the coming months, said ABI Executive Director Amy Quackenboss.
Lawyers Vetted
Because of a bankruptcy law change, small business cases had been expected to rise even before the current economic turmoil, leading White’s office last year to vet about 250 new lawyers to help handle a surge of filings.
The new law lets smaller companies use bankruptcy to clear their debts and reorganize faster and more cheaply than previously. Last month, Congress boosted the number of businesses eligible for the program by making it available to any company with less than $7.5 million in debt.
The new lawyers aren’t government employees, but instead will be appointed to act as mediators and advisers in small-business cases. White pre-selected them from among 3,000 applicants, picking those with some accounting and general business backgrounds to give courts a pool of experts to draw from.
Consumers and small business owners have seen the most dramatic change in the bankruptcy system so far. That’s because in normal times, U.S. Trustee attorneys preside over thousands of meetings a month between debtors and creditors. These so-called 341 meetings, named after a section of the bankruptcy code, are the only time a creditor can directly ask a debtor questions under oath. The answers are key evidence in every consumer and small business case.
Because of social-distancing requirements, 60,000 such meetings were canceled, White said. Future meetings will be held by telephone, which is why U.S. Trustee offices have added 1,200 new conference lines, according to an agency statement.
‘Pivotal Step’
“It’s a pivotal step particularly for consumers,” White said. The U.S. Trustee has probably sent 1 million notices to people about the cancellations, he said.
The changes have been more subtle in big corporate cases, which generate almost all the headlines but were a tiny fraction of the 757,000 bankruptcies filed last year.
At the start of the pandemic, judges in the three main corporate bankruptcy venues -- Delaware, New York and Texas -- switched to video for most routine court hearings and in some cases canceled more complicated proceedings. In Wilmington, Delaware, where Sontchi is chief judge, lawyers were told to wait until May if a dispute wasn’t time-sensitive.
Retail cases like, Pier 1 Imports and Modell’s Sporting Goods, were put on hold because they involved liquidation sales that can’t be held when stores are under orders to stay closed.
“It is hard,” Sontchi said. “If it’s important, if it’s urgent, we’re hearing it.”
Oil-Patch Cases
In Houston, which will soon be swamped with insolvent oil industry companies, Judge David R. Jones and Judge Marvin Isgur have been holding training sessions for lawyers on how to use the court’s videoconferencing software to smooth out proceedings.
Corporate bankruptcy lawyers, who often charge more than $1,000 an hour, have been busier than ever preparing cases. Still, they are holding back on filing them because the system is under so much strain.
The cases that may be ready to go probably won’t make it to court until the end of June, said Robert Hirsh, a bankruptcy partner with the law firm Lowenstein Sandler.
There will be fewer filings in April “unless it’s a true, dire emergency or pre-arranged case,” he said. “There’s so much backlog and things are on hold. Getting first-day hearings are not going to be easy.”"

Why does he feel so small?,"Joe Biden the idea lives in our minds. He’s a statesman, a senator, a vice president who helped start wars, confirm Supreme Court justices and expand health care to millions of Americans. He’s larger than life, a big effing deal.
This story was featured in Drop Me The Link, our one-story election newsletter. Sign up to get it in your inbox three times a week.
Joe Biden the man, on the other hand, takes up considerably less space.
“I’m locked in a basement,” he said, live-streaming into the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO’s virtual convention on a recent Tuesday from his home in Delaware. “Like a lot of you are.”
This month, Biden as much as clinched the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. It is unquestionably the biggest thing to happen in his decades-long career as a public servant, and yet, shrunken down to the size of an iPhone screen or panel in a Zoom chat, the candidate has never seemed quite so small.
“I would like to see more of him,” said Gloria Wilkins, 66, a self-described “enthusiastic” Biden supporter in Georgia. “I’ve started to wonder if [New York Gov. Andrew M.] Cuomo should run for president.”
“I think he should be more present,” said Stephanie Johnson, a social worker from outside Denver. “I think he should be getting his opinion out there more, or telling us what he would be doing, or at least saying what an idiot Trump is.”
“Huh, you know, I really haven’t seen him much,” said Denise Minton, a retired pipe fitter in Michigan. “I wonder if that’s intentional.”
It’s not, the Biden campaign says. He’s increasing his time in the friendly corners of television: going on “The View,” wearing a Phillies baseball cap on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show on what would have been Opening Day (“It’s the way to be able to sleep with my wife,” Biden said. “She’s a Philly girl”), and having an amiable back-and-forth with CNN’s Chris Cuomo (“It’s good to see you, pal,” he said). This week he chatted with Sen. Bernie Sanders on Periscope, the two calling for a unified party just one day before former president Barack Obama came off the sidelines to endorse his former wingman.
He also upped the number of “virtual town halls,” started podcasting and looked for outside-the-box opportunities to get his message out, even if that means staying in with his bookshelves, his family photos and that small desk lamp in the corner.
Maybe he has no choice but to follow the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to be a model citizen and ace social distancer, to seek his connections with the electorate in isolation. And maybe the approach will have political benefits. It’s possible that voters will look at Biden stuck at home and see a pocket-size reflection of themselves — even though he wears a suit (including the pants, his campaign confirmed).
But then again, after a month of amateur haircuts, canceled gym memberships and questionable personal hygiene, who wants to look in a mirror right now?
The coronavirus affects the various political animals differently: Where it's caused Biden to shrink, it's pumped even more airtime into the Donald Trump show, giving the president the opportunity to vamp, contradict his scientific advisers, and pick fights with the media in front of millions of viewers who tune in to his nightly news conference-cum-campaign rally. It's even made New York Gov. Cuomo into something of a Democratic star, who, with his state a center of the pandemic, has provided his own daily briefings for a nation desperate for solid information.
“The challenge for Biden is that he doesn’t have a perch from which to do that at the moment,” said Ian Sams, a former spokesman for Sen. Kamala D. Harris’s presidential campaign. “He’s retired.”
Sure, he can roll out endorsements or release blueprints to rebuild an economy, but traditional political news can’t survive long in a pandemic. It usually dies as soon as Trump’s evening performance in the White House briefing room comes to life.
Sams is of the belief, shared by many, that politically speaking this may not matter. People already know who Biden is, and what he stands for, Sams said. Or, to put it in consultant speak:
“His brand as a candidate is already baked in,” he said. “His brand is appealing right now. His brand is competence.”
Even if his brand is Ovaltine, something marketed to older people that doesn’t really taste very good — at least it’s not a nondescript bag of dried beans in the basement. The idea of Biden has always meant a return to “normalcy,” and even if such a thing isn’t possible anymore, it’s been enough for him to vanquish his flashier Democratic rivals. So what if he stumbled at the debates (“My time’s up,” he said), or that the more time he spent in a state, the worse he seemed to do there (hello, New Hampshire and Iowa).
Biden, who has run for president three times, has always had his weaknesses as a campaigner. He’s prone to misstatements and trips over his messaging (most recently, refusing to call for Wisconsin to delay its in-person primary held in the midst of a pandemic, only to say after the fact that his “gut” told him it was a bad idea).
Perhaps all he needs to win this election is to not be Trump. The president may be getting good television ratings, but the more people hear him speak, the more they seem to disapprove of the job he’s doing. Perhaps less is more for Biden.
And so, an idea has taken hold among some in the chattering class, that the best thing Biden can do is keep a low profile so as not to tarnish the myth with reality.
“Joe Biden is stuck in his basement,” a Los Angeles Times column read. “It just might help him win.”
This school of thought, according to Lis Smith, the spokeswoman for Pete Buttigieg’s campaign, is “insane.”
“What’s the lesson we learned from 2016 about sitting around and waiting for Donald Trump to self-destruct?” she said.
Now is the time, she said, to be “omnipresent.” Get Biden on popular podcasts, get him on sports shows, have him talk to Instagram influencers, or do virtual cooking shows. In the last presidential election, it could seem as if Trump controlled every news cycle — even an empty lectern awaiting his arrival seemed to get more airtime than his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Even if the news was bad, he was there and never faded, in the polls or from the forefront of anyone’s mind.
“This is a time to throw caution to the wind,” Smith said, noting that the Biden team deserves credit for moving in this direction. “He’s a human guy and has the opportunity to provide a stark contrast to Donald Trump, so I say do it.”
But then again, perhaps that contrast is as clear as it needs to be. Maybe everyone has seen enough of the two to get it already.
“So much of this election is going to be about the virus and the president’s response to it,” said David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama. “I’m not sure there’s a hell of a lot Biden can do about that.”
Biden, it appears, isn’t so sure either. The old joke about senators is that when they look in the mirror, they all see presidential candidates. And yet on the precipice of clinching the nomination, Biden, the three-time candidate for president, was pining for his old desk.
“I wish I were still in the Senate,” he said late last month. “Being able to impact on some of these things.”
It's easy to feel small in the face of a crisis. No one knows that better than Biden. He's suffered more than most, losing his first wife and an infant daughter in a car crash, and a son to brain cancer. He's not a candidate who can ""feel your pain,"" so much as the candidate who can show you how to live with it. He's always been able to make people believe they are the only ones in the room, but is it possible to transfer that feeling when he's in a room by himself?
“It’s his empathy and his compassion,” his spokeswoman Kate Bedingfeld said, listing the qualities that make him the right candidate for this moment. “As we think about campaigning now, we’re looking for moments and venues and opportunities for forging that connection with people on virtual platforms. It’s easy for him to create in real life; our challenge now is how do we create those moments online.”
So, when not getting briefings or jumping on the phone with Trump for a “good” but otherwise newsless phone call, or broadcasting an unadvertised chat at 3 p.m. on a Monday with Sen. Sanders, he spends his days making calls to supporters. He talks to people who lost family members and lost jobs, and offers to call their mothers and kids, and everyone gets the sense he really would, that his own pain is never far off.
“As a matter of fact, my son Beau’s children live a mile away as the crow flies,’’ he told Jimmy Kimmel. “They walk over through the woods and through a neighborhood, and they sit out in the backyard in two chairs, and I sit up in the porch, and we have our conversations, because I’m not allowed to go hug them. I miss it.”
That, in itself, as Americans shared Passover seders and Easter brunches with their families over videoconference apps, may be the most relatable part of the Biden campaign. Is asking any more of him asking for too much?
“This idea of him breaking through seems to be one of the more idiotic ideas going around Washington right now,” said Anita Dunn, a top adviser to Biden’s campaign. “What you do at a time like this, what Joe Biden is doing, is you put out your best ideas and best proposals, you model presidential leadership.”
And if only a few people notice? Well, hopefully they’ve already got the idea of Biden living somewhere in their heads."

The U.S. Small Business Administration on Tuesday released the most comprehensive report to date of the $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program, a cornerstone of the federal government’s $2.2 trillion response to pandemic. It details more than 1 million applications totaling $247.5 billion approved as of Monday.
As of late afternoon Tuesday, almost 1.2 million applications, totaling more than $268 billion, had been approved since the program launched April 3, according to the SBA’s latest totals. Funds for the program could be exhausted by Thursday, a top White House adviser said, but negotiations in Congress to replenish it remain stalled.
There’s no comprehensive accounting of how much money lenders have disbursed to small businesses so far. JPMorgan & Chase & Co. has funded $9.3 billion to firms and has more than 300,000 businesses in the application process representing $37 billion in loans, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said Tuesday.
Construction companies received approval for 114,838 loans totaling about $34 billion through Monday, the SBA report shows. Professional, scientific and technical service companies were approved for 126,372 loans worth $30.3 billion, while holding companies had 2,278 loans approved totaling $888 million. Manufacturing firms had applications totaling $30.3 billion, and health care and social assistance firms $27.9 billion.
Loan applications from Texas, California, Florida, Illinois and New York accounted for nearly a third of the total amount, according to the report.
Tuesday’s report shows that 70% of the loans approved were for $150,000 or less, but they accounted for just 15% of the $247.5 billion in total approved lending. Almost 40% of that total went to loans between $1 million and $5 million, and about 10% to businesses that borrowed more than $5 million.
The program offers loans of as much as $10 million. They are forgivable if proceeds are used to keep workers on the payroll and cover rent and other approved expenses for about two months, a short-term stopgap designed to help businesses get by until the economy reopens."

Fintechs had been pushing to provide emergency loans to small businesses since mid-March, more than a week before passage of federal legislation that created the Paycheck Protection Program. The companies have said that they can approve loans faster than traditional banks and reach the most vulnerable businesses but ran into obstacles before getting Small Business Administration approval.
“The PPP program has manual checks and processes that require time, and we’re doing the best we can despite having tech that can operate at scale and efficiency,” said Brian Peters, executive director of Financial Innovation Now, an industry group that counts PayPal and Square as members. Fintechs have had to “retool their lending programs to make PPP work.”
PayPal Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman was on calls with the Treasury Department for weeks prior to getting PPP approval Friday, including speaking directly with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to a company representative. They discussed PayPal’s capacity and capabilities to get funds in a timely manner to small and midsize businesses, particularly those from disadvantaged areas or demographics.
One reason it took fintechs longer than traditional banks to participate in the PPP was that they had to wait on final authorization from the Small Business Administration, said Karen Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former SBA administrator. The Treasury Department and the SBA didn’t release the application form for fintech and other non-bank lenders until last week.
“I think the fintechs were working very hard on the front end, but the back end of the pipe that hooks up to the fire hose of money, they had to wait for the Treasury for that,” Mills said.
The SBA didn’t provide an immediate comment.
PayPal, Square and Intuit all serve small businesses that are often overlooked by large banks because it’s costly for them to underwrite very small loans, according to Jo Ann Barefoot, chief executive officer of the Alliance for Innovative Regulation.
Smaller Loans
As many as 70% of PayPal’s small-business loans go to U.S. counties that have lost 10 or more banks since the financial crisis in 2008, according to Schulman. The company’s loans are generally less than $25,000 each -- something true as well for small businesses seeking help from PayPal under the PPP, Schulman said in an email.
Square also serves borrowers that “have been locked out of the financial system,” said Jackie Reses, Square Capital lead. Women make up 55% of Square Capital borrowers, and 37% are under-represented minorities, she said in an interview.
Under the PPP, financial institutions including Bank of America Corp. have been favoring existing small-business customers because the process is easer if a borrower has been previously approved. On Monday, a federal judge ruled that preferential treatment under the CARES Act wouldn’t be barred after Bank of America was sued by a number of small businesses for being left out.
Florida Senator Marco Rubio said Monday on Twitter that the main challenge with PPP is no longer lender confusion, but that more lenders, including non-bank lenders, are needed to speed up distribution.
Fintechs are starting to take part in the PPP when almost three-quarters of the $349 billion program has already been allocated. The funding may run out as early as Thursday, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said. An effort to add an additional $250 billion has stalled in Congress.
PayPal is offering access to the PPP to its existing 10 million merchants through a relationship with WebBank, a Salt Lake City-based bank that it already partners with for its Working Capital business. The company’s first emergency-loan borrowers include a chiropractic office in Kansas City, Missouri; a nail salon in Bayonne, New Jersey; and a shoe store in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the PayPal representative said.
Automated Process
Intuit is using QuickBooks Capital, its existing business-loan platform, to automate and expedite the PPP application process, according to a company statement. Square’s program is first being offered to users of the Square payments platform, but the company said it plans to extend it to other borrowers once processes start moving more efficiently. The company has yet to approve any PPP applications.
“We launched when we were confident we could provide a smooth processing experience for all applicants, to give sellers more transparency around the status of their funds,” Reses said. “This is also why we’ve staggered our application rollout to Square sellers, as loan reviews are still a manual process.”
Now that fintechs have PPP approval, the next challenge is getting enough funding from the federal government to reach everyone in need, said Mills of Harvard Business School.
“I’m encouraged by the progress,” she said, “but we are not quite at the point we need to be where billions of dollars are flowing seamlessly to smaller and more vulnerable businesses.”"

The cuts target Head Start, a national early-childhood program aimed at educating children from low-income families. Chancellor Lewis D. Ferebee said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the program, planned to withhold federal funding after flagging safety issues in the school system’s operation of the program. Rather than lose the funding, he pulled the application, he said, adding that he plans to address the systemic issues and consider reapplying in future years.
The school system will not lose any prekindergarten seats for 3- and 4-year-olds, Ferebee said. But 83 employees who provide social, health and academic support to the Head Start program and its students are expected to lose their jobs.
Established in 1965 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty program, Head Start is intended to give children living in poverty a quality education before they reach kindergarten. The program also provides wraparound social and health services and teacher training. It has survived Democratic and Republican presidents, receiving funding increases under the Trump administration.
Congress has passed stringent regulations for the program. Funding is competitive and programs need to meet the standards to receive it. The D.C. school system received about $14 million in Head Start funding this academic year, Ferebee said, although he said an influx of higher-income families would have cut that funding by half or more next school year.
The District uses Head Start funding in its universal prekindergarten program for 3- and 4-year olds. Students who qualify for the program learn in the same classrooms as students who don’t.
But the school district has long run into trouble for failing to comply with the program’s requirements. A 2010 federal review of the program said “we believe the DCPS Head Start program currently does not have the capacity to manage accounts for Federal funds and is not capable of operating a Head Start program in accordance with Federal regulations.”
More recently, the federal government, which requires that schools report incidents to the federal program managers, has found safety issues, largely involving supervision of children. A 2019 performance report from the federal Office of Head Start listed two sexual incidents involving the program’s young participants. In one incident, an aide found two toddlers unsupervised in the bathroom. She said one was performing oral sex on the other.
The incident was reported to police and other local agencies but not to the regional Head Start offices, according to the performance report. Head Start learned of the incident when an anonymous person reported it to a program hotline.
Other child-care operators, including many private child-care centers, in the city also receive Head Start funding. Those programs will not be affected by the chancellor's decision to pull the school system’s application.
United Planning Organization, a nonprofit that operates Early Head Start programs across the city, runs programs for infants to 2-year-olds on some campuses in the traditional public school system. Ferebee said he is not in charge of those applications but anticipates those programs will remain intact.
Erika Bryant, a Head Start teacher at Excel Academy Public School in Southeast Washington, said many elementary school principals do not have a background in early-childhood education and Head Start ensures there are age-appropriate curriculums and activities in preschool programs.
D.C. Public Schools pays the salaries of preschool teachers, and Head Start funds paraprofessionals and support staff that are shared between multiple campuses.
“Head Start has a high-quality model,” Bryant said. “The performance standards is what makes sure that wherever Head Start is, they have those high-quality standards. It can be hard doing it, but it’s worth doing.” 
The loss of Head Start funding arrives as the coronavirus crisis threatens the District’s financial outlook. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) proposed in early March a significant 4 percent increase in spending for each public school student next year. But given likely budget constraints, it is unclear what the school system’s budget will be.
Ferebee did not say whether the city would attempt to use local funds to recoup any of the Head Start losses. But, he said, the local education budget does not rely on this federal funding.
The school system also said the 83 laid-off workers would be first line for school system job openings.
“We haven’t gotten specifics from the city of what the loss of revenue will mean for public schools,” he said.  "
"April 16, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/pentagons-inspector-general-finds-no-evidence-of-undue-influence-in-10-billion-cloud-computing-contract/2020/04/15/9b6e4f42-7f08-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html,The Washington Post,Pentagon’s inspector general finds no evidence of undue influence in $10 billion cloud computing contract,"The Pentagon’s Office of the Inspector General issued a report Wednesday stating it found no evidence of undue influence or pressure on Defense Department personnel who handled a long-disputed cloud computing contract potentially worth $10 billion, despite White House efforts to prevent senior department officials from answering investigators’ questions.
At issue is whether President Trump or his staff sought to influence the Pentagon’s award of its largest-ever cloud computing contract to build the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI).
JEDI was meant to give the U.S. military a powerful, centralized computing system run by a commercial tech company so it could improve deployed troops’ access to intelligence and speed up the Pentagon’s adoption of artificial intelligence. The contract is worth up to $10 billion over 10 years.
Tech giant Amazon had been expected to win the bid, but the Pentagon in a surprise move in October awarded the contract to Microsoft. Trump has not made a secret of his distaste for Amazon, whose founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.
“The evidence we received showed that the [Department of Defense] personnel who evaluated the contract proposals and awarded Microsoft the JEDI Cloud contract were not pressured regarding their decision on the award of the contract by any DoD leaders more senior to them, who may have communicated with the White House,” the report said.
Defense Department officials said they were vindicated by the report.
“The Inspector’s General final report on the JEDI Cloud procurement confirms that the Department of Defense conducted the JEDI Cloud procurement process fairly and in accordance with law,” Air Force Lt. Col. Robert Carver, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement. Carver added that the report should put an end to what he called “media and corporate driven attacks” on Defense Department staff who handled the JEDI procurement.
Good-government advocates said the White House’s decision to invoke executive privilege to prevent senior officials from speaking to investigators could suggest wrongdoing on the part of the president, even though the inspector general found no evidence of a successful intervention.
“Essentially what we learned from the IG report is that while there was no successful effort to influence the award, it appears that they tried given the fact that they invoked the privilege,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. “And that’s not okay. There’s no place for the president’s personal vendettas in a contracting decision.”
The report suggests that investigators were exasperated by the White House’s repeated efforts to prevent senior officials from answering their questions. The investigators made clear that their inability to ask certain questions prevented them from fully exploring the president’s involvement.
“We could not definitively determine the full extent or nature of interactions that administration officials had, or may have had, with senior DOD officials regarding the procurement,” the inspector general wrote in the report.
According to the report, the investigators wanted to interview senior Pentagon officials, including the defense secretary and deputy defense secretary, but the department’s Office of General Counsel “advised us that they would not answer questions related to any communications with President Trump, members of the President’s staff, or other White House officials.”
The Pentagon’s lawyers, the report said, told the investigators that the White House did not authorize the secretary or his deputy to disclose information that would be covered by “presidential communications privilege.”
The investigative team, led by Glenn Fine when he was the acting inspector general, informed the lawyers that the release of any information “potentially protected” by the privilege “would not waive” that privilege, according to the report.
“The DOD OIG is part of the executive branch and therefore distinct from other entities outside the executive branch that may seek” such information, the report said. Further, the team said, it “routinely” receives classified and privileged information from Pentagon components and is able to safeguard it.
Fine undertook the investigation in June, seeking to learn whether current or former Pentagon officials had any conflicts of interest related to their involvement in the acquisition process.
That section of the investigation found that two former defense officials who worked on the JEDI contract violated conflict of interest rules. One of them, a former Pentagon official who worked for Amazon before and after contributing to JEDI procurement work for the Pentagon, violated ethics rules by lying to both Amazon and the Defense Department about the terms of his departure. The report also concluded that a high-level official named Stacey Cummings violated ethics rules by participating in JEDI procurement matters without disclosing that she held Microsoft stock.
The report concluded that neither individual wielded enough power to corrupt the procurement process itself. Five other individuals, including former defense secretary Jim Mattis, were cleared of wrongdoing.
Trump abruptly removed Fine last week as the Pentagon’s acting inspector general. It is unclear whether the dismissal was related to the JEDI investigation. When he lost his acting position, Fine was no longer eligible to run the federal panel Congress created in March to oversee the administration’s management of a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. He remains the department’s deputy inspector general."
"April 16, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/they-werent-close-but-new-yorkers-death-from-covid-19-hit-trump-hard/2020/04/15/0c5417b2-7dc1-11ea-a3ee-13e1ae0a3571_story.html,The Washington Post,"They weren’t close, but New Yorker’s death from covid-19 hit Trump hard","In many ways, Stanley Chera was the opposite of Donald Trump. The president made and lost fortunes mainly using other people’s money, borrowing vast sums from banks around the world. Chera, a major Fifth Avenue property owner who died of complications from the coronavirus last weekend, made his money as a frugal, cash-on-the-barrelhead kind of entrepreneur, cautious where Trump was brash.
But as Chera lay dying in recent days, Trump seemed genuinely affected by his friend’s plight, referring on several occasions to Chera’s rapid descent.
“My deepest sympathies go out to Frieda Chera and the family of the late, great, Stanley Chera, one of Manhattan’s most brilliant real estate minds,” Trump said in a tweeted condolence note to Chera’s family on Monday. “Stanley was charitable, kind, and a wonderful friend. He will be truly missed!”
Trump calls a lot of people his friends, but he has said on several occasions that he doesn’t have close friends in the way most people use the term. Ever since he was a rich kid with a famous name growing up in Queens, Trump was wary of the kind of friendships he saw in the movies.
“I think I have a lot of friends,” Trump said in a 2016 interview with The Washington Post, “but they’re not friends like perhaps other people have friends, where they’re together all the time and they go out to dinner all the time.” He said he always had to wonder whether people wanted to be near him because of his money and power, and not out of genuine friendship.
On the surface, Chera and Trump seemed to have little in common beyond their wealth and line of work. Chera started out in New York’s outer boroughs and was happy to stay there, embedded in the city’s tightknit Syrian Jewish community; Trump had a burning need to get from Queens to Manhattan and never looked back after he made the move in his early 20s.
Chera, who was 78, was a devoutly religious man who gave many millions to charities. Trump was never much of a churchgoer and often failed to fulfill promises to make large donations to good causes.
Despite their differences — Chera once said that his “secret is to stay underleveraged and you can own something forever,” a decidedly un-Trumpian approach — the two men shared a bond that the president has often lamented missing during his three years in Washington. It’s a New York thing, a camaraderie that stems from a common lingo, a brash attitude, a humor that can come off as cruel to people who didn’t grow up with that way of poking those you like as well as those you can’t stand.
“They had a closeness to them, President Trump and Chera,” said Anthony Scaramucci, a fellow New Yorker who did a historically brief stint as Trump’s director of communications in 2017. “In a very weird way, Trump is a bit of a loner. He flattens people very quickly. His relationships are more detached than most people’s. But with someone like Chera, he can connect because he grew up with these people.”
According to three New Yorkers who have known Trump for decades, the president has lamented since arriving at the White House that many Washington politicians don’t get his humor, don’t even realize when he’s being serious and when he’s just mouthing off.
And Trump misses the rough and tumble of New York’s real estate business, where rivals may slam one another one day and make a huge deal together the next. “Most of my friendships are business-related,” he said in the 2016 interview, “because those are the only people I meet. . . . I have people that I haven’t spoken to in years, but I think they’re friends.”
Chera was one of a handful of prominent Syrian Jews who own many of the prime buildings and storefronts along Manhattan’s most storied avenue, which happens also to be where Trump built his most prized structure, Trump Tower.
“Trump never really fit in with the big families that control much of New York real estate,” said one of the top property owners, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing his relationship with the president. “They didn’t really trust him, and they thought he was way too public. These are people who do not like to be in the papers, which Donald lives to do.”
Chera’s son Haim, who is in charge of retail at Vornado Realty Trust, called his father a “giant-hearted champion of the underprivileged.” He told the Real Deal, a New York real estate news site, that his father was a “captain of the team for the correct and just, not the popular.”
Despite their reservations about him, Trump’s Fifth Avenue competitors kept him close and, like him, they played all sides of the game.
As Trump did for most of his career, Chera gave big money to politicians of both parties, often to whomever was in power. Chera’s family real estate firm, Crown Acquisitions, donated more than $20,000 to New York’s Democratic mayor, Bill de Blasio, through his Campaign for One New York in 2015. The next year, Chera gave $30,000 to super PACs backing then-N.J. Gov. Chris Christie (R) and $50,000 to the Trump Victory Committee.
Chera was an early and generous supporter of Trump’s presidential run. From 2016 through 2019, he and his wife gave more than $500,000 to support Trump’s campaigns, Federal Election Commission records show.
Chera attended and organized early fundraisers for Trump. In the 2016 campaign, Chera was one of Trump’s eight New York finance chairs, a mostly honorary position handed out to big donors.
“Chera and I organized a fundraiser for Trump in June [2016],” said Scaramucci, another of the New York finance chairs, “and we had a large room but only about a hundred people — it was still early.”
Scaramucci brought his mother to that event and sat her in the back of the room — “I was trying to fill some seats,” he said. “Stanley went over and moved my mother to the head table. He’s a remarkably classy guy.”
Although Trump did not see him often, Chera was evidently on the president’s mind in recent days. At a news briefing on March 30, Trump said: “I have some friends that are unbelievably sick. We thought they were going in for a mild stay. And, in one case, he’s unconscious — in a coma. And you say, ‘How did that happen?’ ”
The president came back to Chera, without naming him, the next day too: “He’s sort of central casting for what we’re talking about, and it hit him very hard. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Chera had been closely involved in Trump’s reelection effort. During a March 2019 campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., that Chera attended, Trump riffed about him to the crowd: “A friend of mine — he’s very shy, but he’s very rich. He shouldn’t be shy. He’s one of the biggest builders and real estate people in the world. . . . Stanley, those big beautiful buildings in Manhattan. You know those beautiful buildings — he owns them. Stanley, how much did you make this month?”
Beyond their bond as Fifth Avenue property owners, Chera and Trump were connected through the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. In 2008, Chera’s Crown Acquisitions joined with Kushner’s family business, The Kushner Companies, and the private equity firm The Carlyle Group to spend $525 million to buy the retail space at 666 Fifth Avenue, the skyscraper that marked Jared’s debut as a New York developer.
“When you buy a building on Fifth Avenue, the first or second phone call you’re probably going to get is from Stanley,” Kushner said in a video tribute to Chera at a charity event in 2014.
Fifth Avenue landlords described Chera as a dealmaker in real estate and politics — Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were regular visitors to Chera’s office — and an adviser to his three sons and to other entrepreneurs.
Chera’s tenants included Versace, Cartier, Apple and, especially at his properties in New York’s outer boroughs, less well-known retailers such as pharmacies, gyms and other neighborhood services.
Chera started out working at his father’s children’s clothing store, Suzette Kiddie Store, in downtown Brooklyn. Chera expanded the shop, later known as Young World, to several more branches. But he tired of paying rent.
“I was paying $2,000 a month rent, and I was doing business up to the sky,” Chera told the New York Times in 2010. “I said, ‘What am I doing?’ The building next door came up for sale, so I purchased it and started accumulating properties in the city.”"
"April 16, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/democrats-in-array-and-trump-in-denial/2020/04/15/9ffd6486-7f48-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html,The Washington Post,Trump’s bad check,"The dear and wise leader wants you to know that whatever good the government does for you is actually being done by him and him alone, since his authority is “total.”
No, we are not North Korea and don’t yet live under a totalitarian system. But President Trump’s demand that his name be affixed to the stimulus checks authorized by Congress to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis tells us three things.
First, everything he does is self-serving. (He doesn’t mind if he delays your check.) Second, his instincts are authoritarian. Third, his bravado, designed to conceal, only highlights his awareness of the deep political trouble he’s in because of his “corruption, carelessness, self-dealing, disinformation, ignorance and just plain meanness.” After all, “pandemics have a way of cutting through a lot of noise and spin to remind us of what is real and what is important.”
Former president Barack Obama used those words in his Tuesday video endorsing former vice president Joe Biden and didn’t even have to mention Trump’s name, a sign of how “total” the president’s failure is.
This week will thus be remembered not for any of Trump’s antics but as the moment when Democrats rediscovered the Spirit of 2018, the year that gave them control of the House because every wing of the party realized that nothing good can happen in our politics until this plague of a presidency is first contained (the motivation behind the new House majority) and then defeated.
The urgent message from Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and the voters of Wisconsin this week was: Enough!
One three-word tweet, poking fun at years (or decades?) of “Democrats in disarray” headlines, captured the reality. “Dems in array,” crowed Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).
Obama’s endorsement was important not just because of what he said about Biden and Trump, but also for what he revealed about Democrats. Obama went out of his way to declare that “if I were running today, I wouldn’t run the same race or have the same platform as I did in 2008. The world is different; there’s too much unfinished business for us to just look backwards.”
He praised Sanders and echoed Warren’s call for “real structural change” because “the vast inequalities created by the new economy are easier to see now.”
Perhaps I should confess to bias because I recently published a book making this point, but Obama’s speech underscored that Democrats are far less divided than their primary battle suggested. From health care to climate change to economic inequality, Democrats have moved across the board in a more progressive direction. Obama has done so himself because he sees openings for social reform now that he didn’t have when he was in office.
In her Wednesday video backing Biden, Warren alluded to the impact of the party’s internal debates by praising the former vice president’s openness to new ideas. “When you come with new facts or a good argument,” she said, “he’s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.” Sanders spoke in the same spirit about Biden in his Monday endorsement.
Any doubts that the 2020 playing field is very different from 2016’s were laid to rest by the unexpected — and unexpectedly comfortable — victory of liberal Jill Karofsky over conservative incumbent Daniel Kelly in a race for a state Supreme Court seat that was a party contest in all but name.
In 2019, when conservative Brian Hagedorn eked out a 5,960-vote victory over liberal Lisa Neubauer in another Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Trump’s supporters touted it as a sign of how hard it would be for Democrats to carry the state over Trump, despite the Democratic surge in 2018.
So what will they say now about Karofsky’s inroads into conservative areas that allowed her to build a margin of more than 160,000 votes? Yes, Karofsky was helped by the presidential primary between Biden and Sanders that drew Democrats to the polls. But in going to court to force an election in the midst of a pandemic, Republicans figured they would win by holding down turnout in Democratic urban areas most affected by the virus. A shameful ploy was foiled because Democrats mobilized absentee ballots in unprecedented numbers. This speaks to where the energy in politics is right now. It’s not on Trump’s side.
Thus, a wager: When Americans see Trump’s name on those stimulus checks, most won’t regard him as their benefactor. They will see a weak, desperate and selfish man who pretends that the money they pay in taxes is his own."
"April 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/britain-extends-lockdown-as-boris-johnson-recovers-in-countryside/2020/04/16/9b9ec090-7f36-11ea-84c2-0792d8591911_story.html,The Washington Post,"Britain extends lockdown, as Boris Johnson recovers in countryside","LONDON — With its once-accelerating number of coronavirus infections only now beginning to slow, Britain announced Thursday that it will continue its lockdown for at least three weeks — a decision that affects the lives and incomes of millions, and a decision made without Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Like other nations, Britain is struggling to keep its population safe while providing life support to a flatlining economy. But it is doing so without its head of government, who is recovering from a vicious bout with the virus, which Johnson said “could have gone either way.”
It has been 25 days since Britain ordered its version of a lockdown — and Johnson has spent 21 of those days first sick and in self-isolation, then in a hospital ward and an intensive care unit, and now in recovery at the prime minister’s official countryside retreat, where aides say he is not working.
Thursday’s decision by his cabinet to maintain the status quo — involving stay-at-home measures and business closures — is the easy part. Hospital admissions have just begun to plateau in Britain, but the daily death toll continues to soar and infection rates in nursing homes are high.
Much harder is how and how fast to ease social distancing measures and revive the economy. This requires big decisions and a fine balancing of competing interests.
The government is facing mounting pressure to outline its plans for the future — or, at least, give a sense of its thinking.
Asked at a Thursday news conference about specifics on how restrictions may be eased, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is running the government in Johnson’s absence, was vague: “Measures could involve various permutations, some going strong, some easing off.”
Government ministers are debating a slew of potential actions: whether to continue to shield the elderly while allowing younger people more freedom of movement; whether to bring back some business sectors before others; whether to maintain higher levels of social distancing in some parts of the country than others.
Keir Starmer, the new leader of the opposition Labour Party, is calling for the government to publish its “exit strategy” so people and businesses can at least begin to imagine what comes next.
Meanwhile, columnists and commentators say the government’s failure to explain what might come next is frustrating — that it is treating British citizens as children who can’t handle the truth.
Polls show that the British public overwhelmingly supports the lockdown. A recent YouGov poll found that 91 percent of Britons supported an extension beyond its initial three-week period.
Cabinet ministers have said Johnson left them with clear instructions on how to carry on in his absence. But a lot has changed while he has been sick.
Nursing home deaths have surged, and authorities have struggled to obtain and distribute protective equipment to health-care workers and to quickly make available tests that can detect both ongoing and past infection.
Johnson’s personal struggle with the coronavirus focused Britain’s attention on the seriousness of the pandemic and encouraged people to submit to drastic measures to restrict movement.
Now, as Britain contemplates its next moves, it must do so in the absence of a prime minister known for his ability to communicate.
This week, especially, communications have been somewhat muddled. Northern Ireland, one of the four nations in the United Kingdom, did not wait for Raab’s extension announcement and unilaterally said its lockdown would be extended until May 9. Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, said now was the time to “dig in, to stay strong and save lives.”
Earlier Thursday, before Raab’s announcement, Britain’s top two health officials appeared to be talking past each other.
Deputy Health Minister Nadine Dorries raised eyebrows when she tweeted that “there is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine.”
Many experts have said it would take 12 to 18 months for a vaccine to be developed and distributed.
Asked about the remarks Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock stressed that Dorries’s use of the word “full” was key. But he conceded that it would “take time” before things return to the way they were.
Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King’s College London, said an extension of the restrictions was not surprising — not least because Johnson isn’t in the driving seat.
“It’s just inconceivable that this lot would try and take decisions without Boris Johnson being there. He’s the beating heart of this government in a way that hasn’t been the case since the heyday of Tony Blair,” the Labour Party leader who served as prime minister from 1997 to 2007.
The cabinet, Menon said, owed their jobs to Johnson, not to mention the Conservative Party’s thumping December election victory, which was led by the prime minister.
“No one is taking big decisions in his absence,” Menon said.
Downing Street officials say all decisions will be “guided by scientific and expert advice.”

One of Britain’s top epidemiologists, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College in London, told the BBC on Thursday, “It’s not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some form of social distancing, a significant level of social distancing, probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available.
Earlier, Ferguson and his team, whose models have informed 10 Downing Street and the White House, said a strategy to suppress the virus would have to remain for as long as 18 months, until a vaccine is widely available, and that governments should not think of one wave but successive waves of infection, which could entail authorities loosening, then tightening, then again loosening restrictions.
Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank, said that constitutionally, Britain is governed by a cabinet, the government’s top leadership team, and this is true whether Johnson or Raab is at the helm. “The U.K. prime minister doesn’t have the same overt executive powers that a U.S. president has,” she said.
She noted that though the prime minister is “the first among equals in the cabinet,” his role was “sort of a chairmanship role over his cabinet, rather than being a CEO alone.”
That doesn’t mean the prime minister doesn’t have power. He has the power to advise the queen on who is in his cabinet — in other words, he decides whom to hire and fire, which gives him a lot of political power.
Raab, Haddon said, was “only there through the borrowed authority of Boris Johnson. If the cabinet turned around and said, ‘We don’t respect his authority and Raab should cease doing his job,’ then you’d have a clash that would have to be resolved. How you resolve is a tricky constitutional question.”"

On Wednesday, folks in Maryland — like people in other states and cities across the nation — had to begin wearing face coverings in stores and on public transit to curb the spread of the coronavirus. And outside the rural farm and feed store where I buy our pets’ food, it got ugly.
“Sir, you can’t enter the store without a mask,” a worker stationed outside the entrance said to an older man forging ahead past the fruit sapling and tomato plant display with nothing to hide the scowl on his face. “Sir.”
The man jutted his chin out and pulled his shoulders back.
“This is America,” he spat. “You can’t tell me what I gotta wear.”
A second, larger store employee joined the first guy, silently, and the huffing boomer swatted at the air and returned to his truck.
Yes, this is America, sir.
And buying the stars-and-stripes yard art and truck decals and listening to the country music playing inside that Maryland store isn’t what defines being an American right now.
Clogging the state capital in Michigan, waving American, Trump and a few Confederate flags while chanting “Lock her up” in defiance of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order — as protesters are doing this week — isn’t living up to that ideal either.
Holding religious services and parties in defiance of social distancing is not American.
Right now? Sacrificing is American.
Wearing the mask, staying at home, innovating, pivoting, doing what you can to keep people safe and working is American.
This is the first time since World War II that all Americans have been asked to sacrifice.
Sure, we had some warm-fuzzy unity in the weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. But the biggest change in behavior for most Americans was airport shoe removal and building security. The families of those killed and wounded that day, the military and Muslim Americans bore the load on that one. The rest of America moved on, even as the war that began almost two decades ago continues.
We’ve got a president (and two former presidents) who demonstrated how easy it was for many Americans to avoid putting their lives at risk during the Vietnam War.
The nation has seen other conflicts, other financial and health crises, but not any that required every single American to sacrifice in some way.
That’s why we keep mooning over the Greatest Generation. World War II touched everyone and demanded sacrifices from everyone. And here’s our chance to emulate them.
Nearly half a million Americans made the ultimate sacrifice during that war.
But while men and women went to war zones, the Americans — all of them — back at home supported them and went without.
They planted victory gardens, bought more than $180 billion in war bonds, sealed loose lips and baked war cakes. They went without stockings and sugar. The women left home and riveted in America’s factories and shipyards.
There were terrible injustices: Japanese Americans were robbed of their property and liberty, African Americans were subjected to segregation and violence. Yet their sons still fought for this country, displaying astonishing heroism.
Once again, we have a global threat impacting every single American. Some have lost loved ones, some have lost paychecks, some have lost businesses they spent years building. At least 22 million jobs have vanished in the past four weeks.
“We will not comply” chants from protesters in Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio this week are heartfelt when they come from folks who can’t work and are on the brink of losing everything.
But these protests — one is also planned in Virginia’s capital this week — are disturbingly political.
The public health orders and shutdowns aren’t the whims of overreaching governors, as right-wing agitators are trying to paint them during these angry rallies, swaddling the angst in cheap Americana and further dividing a nation that is struggling to unite and sacrifice together.
This is happening everywhere.
From Times Square to Trafalgar Square, from Bondi Beach to Waikiki Beach, the Eiffel Tower to the Macau Tower — everything is shut down by necessity.
Tucker Carlson is telling his Fox News viewers that Whitmer’s social distancing guidelines are a show to catch Joe Biden’s eye for a VP slot.
So does that mean every leader across the globe is shutting down their nation’s economies to impress Biden, too? Ridiculous. Dangerous. Divisive.
There is only one group of people who can help us survive this pandemic — the people in power.
When we needed factory workers during World War II, American leaders found a way to create progressive and nurturing child-care centers that even sent kids home with a warm and healthy dinner so women could go to work.
Instead of harnessing that kind of power and action, Washington is filled with infighting and finger-pointing. The $350 billion Paycheck Protection Plan ran out of money in two weeks while glitches are preventing the $1,200 stimulus checks from reaching many Americans.
It’s time for the Trump administration and Congress to set an example.
And it’s time for the guy at the feed store to put a mask over his piehole and understand what it really means to be an American."

We made it through most of President Trump’s term in office without facing a crisis that required great presidential leadership. Now, our luck has run out, and we are on our own.
It is difficult to overstate the scope of the challenge that covid-19 presents to the nation and the world — or the tragic inadequacy of Trump and his administration. Sometimes, an underestimated president improbably rises to meet the moment: Think of Harry S. Truman rebuilding a free and peaceful Europe after World War II, or George W. Bush rallying the nation with his bullhorn in the ruins of the World Trade Center. But Trump has become smaller, pettier, more self-absorbed. He failed.
There is much that the nation desperately needs right now: more financial help for the tens of millions of newly unemployed; more support for small businesses on the brink of failure; more consistent guidance on surviving the crisis day-to-day. But there is one need that surpasses all the rest, because meeting it could change everything and put us on the path to recovery: quick, reliable, universal testing that can tell us who has been infected with the novel coronavirus and who has not.
Trump could make that happen. Bizarrely, and tragically, he refuses to act.
Private companies, universities and government scientists have quickly developed an array of tests. Trump should use his powers under the Defense Production Act to mandate production of enough test kits — and the build-out of enough laboratory capacity to process all those tests promptly — to make it possible for every American to be tested periodically. That information would allow the nation to function at some reasonable level for the 12 to 18 months until, hopefully, we have an effective vaccine.
This would be a massive logistical effort, analogous to the way automobile companies shifted to war production during World War II. It would necessarily involve sourcing much-needed equipment from other countries, especially China. Only the federal government has the capacity to design and oversee such a program. Instead, Trump refuses to do his job.
“States can do their own testing,” he has said. “We’re the federal government. We’re not supposed to stand on street corners doing testing.”
That is precisely what the federal government should be doing. But it’s a daunting task, requiring consistent, determined leadership — which Trump will not even try to provide. What he gives us instead is “The Trump Show,” a daily televised farce in which he tries to keep alive his reelection hopes by deflecting responsibility and trying to change the subject.
Governors have had to fill the vacuum. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) of New York, whose state is the epicenter of infection in this country, has displayed steady leadership and continues to give must-see daily briefings that provide not just solid information but also a welcome measure of comfort. Govs. Jay Inslee of Washington and Gavin Newsom of California, both Democrats, reacted to covid-19 with early stay-at-home orders that kept infections, hospitalizations and deaths in their states relatively low.
Cuomo and Newsom have each organized regional consortia of states, one in the Northeast and one on the West Coast, that will coordinate the steps they take toward reopening once that process can be started. Governors of seven Midwest states reportedly are forming a similar compact. Cuomo said Thursday that the Northeast states will keep their social distancing orders in place at least through May 15. Such coordinated blocs of states will surely do all they can to bring testing capacity up to scale — but it is difficult to see how they could even get close to universal testing without help from the federal government.
Private companies will play a role as well. Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos (who also owns The Post) said Thursday that he hopes to soon begin regular testing of all of Amazon’s 900,000-plus employees. Other big employers are likely to follow. But that will be just a start.
Thus far, only about 3.3 million Americans have been tested — out of a population of 328 million. Unbelievably, according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fewer tests are being done this week than last week. How is this possible? Does American exceptionalism now mean hapless incompetence rather than resolute strength?
Meanwhile, Trump is reportedly still fixated on the dangerous fantasy of reopening the country in two weeks and filling professional sports stadiums with cheering fans. We will win this war because we must. But victory won’t come because of Trump; it will come in spite of him."
"April 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/small-business-fears-come-true-as-virus-rescue-funds-run-out/2020/04/16/b91a291e-7ff1-11ea-84c2-0792d8591911_story.html,The Washington Post,Small Business Relief Funds Drained Fast With Many Shut Out,"The U.S. Small Business Administration said it has stopped accepting applications for two programs meant to help small firms survive the coronavirus outbreak after funding ran out, leaving many worried about getting desperately needed aid.
Funds for the $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, to keep workers on payrolls have been exhausted, the SBA said on Thursday. And money also has lapsed for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, or EIDL, offering government loans and emergency grants of as much as $10,000.
“These two loan programs are essential, and neither one is operational now,” said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis for the National Federation of Independent Business, the largest group representing small businesses in the country. “It’s absolutely terrible for the small business sector.”
Congress is debating adding an additional $250 billion to PPP, and small business advocates are calling on lawmakers to add more money for the disaster loan program as well. About 100 members of Congress signed a letter Thursday to SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza with concerns about the EIDL program, saying they would strongly back a request for more funding. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters he supports adding money to the program, and a Senate Democratic bill floated last week included money for it.
Without more money for the PPP program, many small firms that have flooded banks with applications won’t get help because the government-backed loans were available on a first-come, first-served basis, and after just two weeks there’s no money left for the SBA to guarantee additional loans, officials said.
Brad Close, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, the largest group representing small businesses in the country, said its members’ worst fears just came true.
“America’s small businesses are on the brink, trying desperately to keep their doors open and support their employees,” Close said in a statement. “They have been let down by lawmakers and the bureaucracy, with the smallest businesses most disadvantaged in attempting to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program.”
Small businesses are continuing to seek loans and existing applications are still pending SBA approval, and Congress needs to act, Consumer Bankers Association President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Hunt said.
“The millions of men and women who work at America’s small businesses and their families are battling a health crisis while also facing an economic crisis unless Congress authorizes additional funds for this program,” Hunt said in a statement.
Wells Fargo & Co., which was the No. 3 SBA-approved lender by volume last year, said it will continue accepting new applications so it will be ready to proceed if and when Congress adds funds to the program. The firm said Tuesday that it hadn’t funded loans anywhere close to the $9.3 billion in loans that JPMorgan Chase & Co. said Tuesday it had.
Because banks make the PPP loans, not the SBA, the fund isn’t technically “out of money” but rather the agency has guaranteed $339 billion to be disbursed, Celtic Bank spokeswoman Linda Howell said. The bank is concerned about “authorization hoarding” by lenders that potentially can’t fund the loans, Howell said. Celtic Bank has disbursed $50 million as of Thursday morning with an additional $93 million in loans that have been authorized and are being processed, she said.
The SBA said on its website that while it unable to accept new applications for the EIDL loans and emergency grants without more funding, firms that had already submitted their applications will continue to be processed on a first-come, first-served basis.
But small business owners have complained about waiting weeks for answers and funding, and some are getting less than they expected because of the demand. The NFIB said a survey of its members released April 9 found only 4% had been approved and no business owner had received a loan or grant. The SBA has not disclosed how many applications have been approved and funded.
As of Thursday morning, the SBA reported there had been more than 1.6 million applications for PPP loans approved for about $339 billion. That amount is the value of loans approved for lenders to disburse, not money that has reached borrowers. Comprehensive data on how much money has actually been handed out isn’t available, but lenders report that disbursements are being made. The program launched April 3.
Loan approvals had to stop short of the $349 billion total funded by Congress because about $10 billion is needed to cover fees and processing, Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said in a tweet.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza called on Congress to approve more money for the program Wednesday in a joint statement saying it’s “saving millions of jobs” and helping small firms survive the pandemic.
Republicans sought to approve an additional $250 billion for the program last week, but the effort stalled with Democrats also wanting changes to the program and more aid for other groups. Democrats and Mnuchin remained far from agreement after a first day of talks on Thursday.
Ryan Metcalf, head of U.S. regulatory affairs at Funding Circle, an online small business lender that was approved to lend under the program Wednesday, said the company has thousands of people in line for funding. Given how quickly the initial $349 billion was exhausted, the next round should be far larger than $250 billion, he said.
The PPP, which was enacted last month as part of a $2.2 trillion relief package in response to the outbreak, offers loans of as much as $10 million. The loans convert to grants if proceeds are used to keep workers on the payroll and cover rent and other approved expenses for about two months, a short-term stopgap designed to help businesses get by until the economy reopens.
The initiative got off to a rocky start after Trump administration officials said that small businesses would get funding quickly, even the same day they applied. But some borrowers couldn’t find banks to take their applications if they didn’t already have a lending relationship, and lenders couldn’t process loans because of vague guidance and an overwhelmed SBA computer system.
Of the more than 1 million applications that SBA had processed as of Monday, construction firms had a larger share of loans approved than other industries so far, followed by professional, scientific and technical service companies, manufacturers and health care and social assistance firms. The average loan amount for all applications approved was $239,152, an SBA report shows.
“Oh my god,” said Alex Steed, co-owner of Knack Factory, a video production firm in Portland, Maine, that’s awaiting funding for a loan. “This is playing out just about exactly how I expected it to. It never felt like this was for small business owners anyway, or manufactured with our needs in mind.”"

Council on Thursday for tax abatements and other help for restaurants, retailers, hotels and entertainment venues devastated by the coronavirus-related shutdown.
During a hearing held online and via teleconference, members of the recently launched DC2021 forecast a wave of bankruptcies and permanent closures for District businesses unless the city steps forward with help.
“If we can just keep the heart beating, that’s what this is about,” said Monty Hoffman, founding member of the new organization and chairman of the real estate development company Hoffman & Associates. “It’s not making profits, it’s trying to keep these businesses and the jobs they create going.”
Hoffman and other business owners told council members that the sector employs 30 percent of working D.C. residents and provides $2.7 billion in annual District tax revenue. But many of the entrepreneurs behind these businesses are thinking of shutting down and doing something else.
“And if they do something else, then it’s going to cost an enormous amount of capital and time to get someone else to come back in, if we are ever able to get someone else to come back in,” said real estate developer Richard Lake of Roadside Development.
Members of DC2021 told council members they were hopeful for a partial reopening in the summer, but that they expect many businesses to suffer for many more months.
“I believe we are looking at a year or more time frame,” Lake said. Government help could mean “the difference between losing 40 percent of these businesses or losing 70 percent of these businesses,” he said.
Andy Shallal, DC2021 member and owner of the restaurant chain Busboys and Poets, said the District stands to lose a substantial portion of its business tax base.
“For a lot of businesses, they’re paying yesterday’s bills with today’s revenue, and when that spigot is cut off, the avalanche is overwhelming,” Shallal said. “For many businesses that I’ve talked to and many restaurateurs that I’ve talked to, the idea of folding is very real.”
And Shallal said there isn’t much time to help. “This cannot be an issue of months,” he said. “This has to be an issue of days, and maybe weeks at the most.”
The group presented dire potential recovery curves for the restaurant, retail, hotel and entertainment sector, with a best-case scenario showing a 70 percent recovery by early 2021, when a vaccine for covid-19 might be available. The worst-case scenario showed a less than 30 percent recovery for the sector into 2022.
Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) questioned the accuracy of the dismal projections. “I think that what we have here is a period of time when there’s an issue and then a bounce back,” she said.
But Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) called the projections an important “dose of realism.”
“Unfortunately, I think it’s a realistic modeling of what recovery’s going to look like,” Allen said. “It’s not like there’s a switch that’s going to get flipped one day and everything just goes back to the way it was five or six weeks ago.”
Among other tax reductions, the DC2021 members suggested a one-year property tax abatement for District businesses in the sector, which they said would provide $346 million in relief. They said that landlords would pass the tax savings to rent-paying restaurants and other businesses, many of which are failing to pay rent anyway.
The business leaders said the District won’t be able to collect the lost property tax revenue from businesses that have gone under.
Nizam Ali, who’s worked in his family’s historic restaurant, Ben’s Chili Bowl, since he was a child, said the small chain did not pay property taxes due in March on the three buildings it owns.
“We pay $103,000 out of pocket every year for property taxes, and I know that that funds the city, and it’s essential in that way,” Ali said. “But with no income coming in, or extremely little, it’s devastating for us and for other businesses.”
Council members appeared receptive to helping the sector, but said the details would take time to work out and would likely come as part of a broader rescue package for the District’s economy.
“We need to get cash in the hands of those who need the help the most,” Council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) said. But the question is: “What is the most efficient means of doing that?” she asked.
Council member Vincent C. Gray (D-Ward 7) said he supports efforts to lift the District’s larger economy, but residents in his ward will want to be assured that there’s something in it for them.
“Let’s remember the people who are living in areas of the city where they haven’t seen much of the greater good as yet,” he said, “and will need to be convinced . . . in terms of why the investments that we’re arguing need to be made should be made.”"
"April 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/fed-preparing-a-plan-to-publish-transactions-for-crisis-programs/2020/04/16/28781f50-803d-11ea-84c2-0792d8591911_story.html,The Washington Post,Fed Readying Plan to Publish Transactions in Crisis Programs,"The Federal Reserve is working on a plan to publish transactions on its website for its coronavirus emergency lending facilities, as pressure builds for transparency over what could be trillions of dollars of support, according to the central bank.
Congress allocated $454 billion to backstop Fed lending that could expand to as much as ten times that amount in the $2.2 trillion virus relief bill signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 27. The Fed has announced nine programs to help get businesses through the pandemic shutdown, spanning assistance from bridge loans for municipalities, to helping banks push out billions in loans to small- and medium-sized businesses.
The Fed says it is working on a system of robust reporting, though it’s not clear if that will include specific details on which companies received aid. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will face intense congressional scrutiny on who got money and why.
Congressional Pressure
Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the powerful Senate Banking Committee, wrote to Powell and Mnuchin on Thursday to highlight the panel’s role in providing “robust” oversight of the programs, while urging that they work quickly to get them up and running.
Democrat Maxine Waters, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, also sent a letter to Powell Thursday urging him to address concerns over implementation of the Fed’s programs.
The calls came a day after the sole member of a congressional oversight board -- a former top staffer for Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren -- asked Powell directly for information on who was getting cash. Bharat Ramamurti said in a letter to Powell that the central bank had not “announced what information it will publicly release” about its dealings with private companies, or even whether it would release the names of individual beneficiaries.
The Fed launched its initial emergency facilities on March 17 when it offered support to primary dealers in U.S. government bonds and the commercial paper market. It continued to expand the aid as pressure mounted from the virus lock-down. On April 9 it unleashed more measures, including a Main Street loan program, and announced it would buy certain types of high-yield debt. By Thursday, four of the nine programs were fully operational.
Report Due
Bharat, who previously led Warren’s investigations into Wells Fargo & Co., is already preparing for the committee’s first public report on Powell and Mnuchin’s work, due around May 8. The legislation requires the report 30 days after the Treasury and Fed exercise the emergency lending authority. The committee is subsequently required to provide an update monthly.
But the committee’s investigation contains what critics view as an irony. Congress could have set up its own lending board made up of Fed officials and other technocrats to oversee and dole out money. Instead, they gave the Treasury and Fed wide discretion.
The virus-relief bill provides the Treasury Department with funds that can be leveraged up to $4.5 trillion in liquidity through the Fed.
Strings Attached
Congress attached strings to any funding Mnuchin doles out in some programs, ranging from prohibitions against interfering with union organization to limitations on off-shoring jobs. The Fed is adhering to some of the restrictions, asking companies to adhere to limitations in the law on stock buybacks, dividends, compensation, and to make “reasonable efforts” to retain employees during the term of the loan.
“As Congress contemplates loan forgiveness or direct support to firms that are on the brink, it’s reasonable for some conditionality to be attached,” said Nathan Sheets, who has worked at both the Fed and the Treasury Department and is now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income.
But lending by the Fed is “geared toward broad classes of firms, not to a single sector, and with an explicit expectation that the firms are otherwise solvent and that the lending will be repaid,” he said.
Fed programs that buy securities directly in the market are aimed at a broad universe of companies, and it would difficult to apply constraints. “As businesses get larger, the struggles to apply the regulations to the international aspects” of their operations “becomes more difficult,” said Charles Morton, a partner at the law firm Venable LLP.
Step Removed
“With the Fed programs, they can claim to be one step removed and the assistance is provided through a facility rather than being directly negotiated with each company,” the way Treasury’s loans and loan guarantees are set up, according to Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury official during the global financial crisis.
Congress’ limitations on aid from Treasury or the Fed were hotly debated between lawmakers and the Trump administration, according to another person familiar with the matter. Congress had the opportunity to change some of the restrictions on the Fed that were imposed under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act -- specifically a provision that banned bailouts of individual companies -- but lawmakers ultimately decided against it."

Some banks have been doing pretty well out of the latest one.
As the world economy slowed to a near standstill in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, leaving millions unemployed and companies depending on cash lifelines, one corner of global finance thrived: securities trading. From JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Citigroup Inc., Wall Street firms had their best quarter in years buying and selling stocks and bonds. The feast probably won’t last.
From the historic stock-market correction, to the unprecedented government and monetary stimulus packages and the spike in trading volatility, a “unique combination of events” drove client activity to unprecedented levels, according to JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, Jennifer Piepszak. All told, her bank posted $7.2 billion in revenue from trading shares and bonds in the first three months of 2020, up by almost one-third from the first quarter of 2019. That was its best performance in this business, according to Bloomberg data. Citi posted a 39% jump in revenue, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. a 28% increase and Bank of America Corp. a 22% rise, largely exceeding analyst expectations.
The banks were helped by a strong start to the year before the Covid-19 outbreak hit — the U.S. stock market had reached record highs as had debt underwriting. But the surge in trading flows during the March crisis was pivotal. At their peak last month, daily trading volumes in rates and commodities were more than three times greater than the average daily volumes in January, according to JPMorgan. Currency trading reached levels that were more than twice the January average.
The extraordinary operational and financial challenges faced by the investment banks meant this performance — which softened the blow from the billions of dollars of provisions that they made for possible credit losses — was by no means guaranteed. As we entered the lockdowns, it was unclear whether securities firms could manage the dispersal of teams of traders who thrive on proximity and depend on ultra-fast electronic connections. The extreme price and liquidity swings during March’s markets meltdown could have caught them out at the best of times. While JPMorgan and Bank of America have been putting pressure on traders to go into the office, most staff have been working remotely, many from home. Regulators had to allow for greater flexibility around compliance.
And what worked for the Wall Street giants doesn’t necessarily work for everybody. While traders usually love volatility, the breakdown of historic trading patterns has caught some finance firms off guard. As wild price movements rocked the markets, many hedge funds and high-frequency traders pulled back from equity derivatives, for example, allowing JPMorgan and Citi to step in, Bloomberg News reported last month.
For others there could be trading losses eating into revenue. Take France’s BNP Paribas SA. My Bloomberg News colleagues revealed that the French bank, typically a leader in stock derivatives, lost an estimated 200 million euros ($219 million) on equity derivatives, including dividend futures and structured products. The widespread cancelling of corporate dividends also ate into Goldman’s equity revenue, the bank said on Wednesday. The performance of Europe’s investment banks in the quarter remains uncertain.
At the same time, the extraordinary market gyrations and central bank and government interventions are unlikely to be repeated. The near-term markets outlook is uncertain. Goldman executives said trading activity has remained higher than average in the first two weeks of April, but Citi expects a “normalization” of trading in the second quarter. “Low rates and low economic activity may even be a headwind,” JPMorgan’s Piepszak said.
Morgan Stanley CFO Jon Pruzan said on Thursday that trading volume has fallen by between 20% and 30% since March. The bank warned that without the trading boost it got in the first quarter, the crisis will hit earnings.
In a report published this month, Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm, and Morgan Stanley estimated that a 2% drop in global gross domestic product in 2020 would cause credit and equity trading revenue to plummet, with rates and currency trading only offsetting part of the hit. That would cause revenue at the global banks to fall by as much as 17% this year to $131 billion. 
The Federal Reserve’s historic move on April 9 to buy some junk bonds will facilitate trading. But the specter of steep falls in banking revenue this year remains. The International Monetary Fund expects global GDP to shrink by 3% in 2020.
Scale is the only way to shield profitability, according to the Oliver Wyman-Morgan Stanley report. That puts Wall Street in position to build its lead over its European rivals. But for all banks, the early crisis wins can’t be counted on."
"April 17, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/17/trumps-bark-is-always-worse-than-his-bite/,The Washington Post,Trump doesn’t do much other than create chaos,"President Trump earlier this week insisted that governors report to him and he has “total” control. Neither is true. And while it is true that there is a complex, difficult task for the federal government to perform in reactivating the economy — ramping up testing and contact tracing — Trump and his administration of sycophants are entirely incapable of performing it. Hence, he talks big, as he has done throughout his career, and delivers pathetically little, also a feature of his career.
The Post reports: “President Trump unveiled Thursday broad guidelines for states to follow as they begin reopening amid the persistent coronavirus pandemic while leaving the specific plans to the governors.” It set out generic criteria that multiple states have already issued for assessing how to reopen for business. There is no deadline — not even a phony one — and no sign the federal government is to perform the important role of funding and administering a testing and tracing program. This is the ultimate nothing-burger.
Trump told the governors during a conference call earlier Thursday to “call your own shots,” a superfluous admonition. While governors in the pact of northeastern states and in the West Coast alliance all acknowledge that testing is a critical part of any return to work (as did Trump’s own advisers, former advisers, foreign leaders and epidemiologists), Trump tried to muddy the waters (“There are some states where I think you can do with a lot less testing than other people are suggesting. . . . Some are big believers in the testing. Some believe a little less”). No doubt, this is an effort to avoid more questions as to why he is not doing anything to alleviate this critical function.
No wonder Trump’s approval numbers are dropping while those of Congress and governors are soaring. In the latest Gallup poll, Trump’s overall approval rating dropped six points, the “sharpest drop Gallup has recorded for the Trump presidency so far.” In another danger sign for his reelection prospects, “Thirty percent of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S., marking a 12-point drop since the prior reading in early March. A monthly drop this large has only been recorded twice in the past two decades.” By contrast, Congress’s approval is higher than it has been in more than a decade (albeit at a modest 30 percent).
This is not hard to figure out. Trump insults, blames others (e.g., World Health Organization, Democrats, China) and issues decrees as if he is invested with absolute power — even though he does not do much of anything. Insisting his name is on government checks is no substitute for actually constructing stimulus packages (he is a bystander in negotiations) or making full use of the Defense Production Act (either to acquire and distribute ventilators or testing kits).
Voters increasingly understand that Trump was delinquent in his response. A Pew Research Center poll finds, “Nearly two-thirds of Americans (65%) say Trump was too slow to take major steps to address the threat to the United States when cases of the disease were first reported in other countries.” Unlike Trump, they are far more concerned with lifting stay-at-home rules too quickly rather than too slowly.
Despite, or maybe because of, his manic performances at news conferences, voters finally seem to be grasping the reality of the covid-19 threat, understand our current predicament is, in part, a result of Trump’s slothful response and denial and look to those capable of action — Congress and governors — to bring us through the crisis."

The central bank announced nine special lending facilities in rapid succession over the past month, producing what is tantamount to a giant bridge loan for a nation where revenues shrunk, employees stayed home and markets cracked under a stampede of sellers.
Never in Fed history has it done so much, so fast. But of the nine programs, so far four are fully operational -- as the central bank races to roll out some it’s used before and others that are brand new.
While the dizzying acronyms of the Fed’s special lending facilities are confusing, an easier way to look at them is to put them into three buckets:
1. Lender of Last Resort
Since the Fed reached for its emergency lending powers on March 17, many of the programs it introduced qualify as classic lender-of-last-resort efforts. They’re offered to businesses vital to short-term funding markets usually at a premium and in exchange for solid collateral.
Two in this tranche are the Fed’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, which both ensure healthy borrowers aren’t suddenly starved of cash.
Both facilities are operational, with the money market facility reporting $53 billion in loans as of April 8. The CPFF will report holdings April 17.
The central bank also launched a backstop for U.S. government bond dealers to preserve liquidity in this cornerstone of the global financial market known as the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. The facility had $33 billion in loans outstanding as of April 8.
In addition, the Fed created the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility -- like it did in the 2008-2009 financial crisis -- to help financial institutions securitize short-term credits, from auto loans to student loans. The facility is not operational yet.
2. Fiscal Partner
The Fed has entered an unusually close relationship with Congress -- its boss and at times hostile critic -- to combat the pandemic’s economic damage. The $2 trillion virus rescue plan approved by lawmakers appropriated $454 billion for the central bank and Treasury Department to lever up into trillions of dollars of aid as they see fit.
The Fed currently has four facilities in this fiscal-cooperation bucket.
Two of them together make up the Main Street lending program, which will buy up to $600 billion in loans from banks. It’s aimed at supporting mid-sized businesses with up to 10,000 employees and less than $2.5 billion in revenues. Eligible banks may use the facilities to originate new loans or increase the size of existing credit to businesses. Lenders will retain a 5% share of the debt, selling the remaining 95% to the Fed.
The Fed’s working on details of the Main Street facilities and they aren’t running yet.
Another program facilitates the $349 billion Congress designated for Small Business Administration lending, which operate through banks around the country. By serving as a backstop buyer of these assets -- through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility -- the Fed helps free up banks’ capacity to make more of these loans to small businesses.
It’s fully operational and available to provide liquidity to eligible financial institutions.
The Fed’s Municipal Liquidity Facility will buy up to $500 billion in short-term notes issued by large cities and counties and states. It’s designed as bridge liquidity to support them through a period when revenues have been flattened by the shutdown and tax payments are delayed.
In this case, the Fed isn’t providing market liquidity. It is offering to buy notes directly from state and local governments to get them over a revenue hump.
Status: The facility is under development and Fed officials are watching the muni market’s stability and have indicated they could do more. Some members of Congress want the Fed to be able to buy longer-term municipal debt directly outside of an emergency facility.
The scale of these actions are new for the Fed in the post-war period and contain long-term political risk. What’s to stop Congress from asking the Fed to administer disaster relief loans after the next big storm?
“Why is the Fed in charge of all this?” said Aaron Klein, an economic fellow at the Brookings Institution. “The answer is because Congress told them to be. Ironically, the Fed, by being non-partisan” ends up running programs that Congress can’t organize because of partisanship, he said.
3. Investor of Last Resort
Another area Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pushed into is corporate lending. For that, the Fed launched two facilities to support U.S. companies.
One, called the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, will buy debt or loans directly from corporations. The other -- named the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility -- will buy corporate debt in secondary markets, including exchange-traded funds that specialize in high-risk, high-yield debt. The Fed said the combined size of the two facilities could reach $750 billion.
The special purpose vehicles are still under development.
Fed officials regard this as not dissimilar to a program such as the Commercial Paper Funding Facility -- providing liquidity to a market that is critical for corporate finance.
But there is a big difference. The CPFF is mainly limited to top-rated paper, with three month maturity, and companies access it at a penalty rate. The Fed’s secondary bond market facility will buy term debt, some of it at less than investment grade, and will demand more protection from taxpayers as a result.
There isn’t much clarity on pricing for either vehicle but Fed officials want to steer away from discretionary choices if possible and have clear gates and metrics on when and what bonds they buy, and how they determine loan eligibility. It’s going to be challenging.
In the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, the Fed is willing to be the sole investor in a debt issue. John Weinberg, a policy adviser at the Richmond Fed, calls the corporate facilities “the biggest departure” from traditional lender-of-last resort measures.“We are not buying corporate debt to protect the holders of corporate debt,” said Weinberg. “We are buying corporate debt to make sure that the markets for those securities remain liquid.”
“I think there is moral hazard risk with all these things,” he said, “depending on how these actions shape people’s expectations about future policy.”"

The “gating” metrics that states are supposed to meet before reopening are fairly robust: They should see a two-week downward trajectory of flu and Covid-like symptoms, and a two-week downward trajectory of documented cases or positives as a percent of total tests. And they should be well enough equipped to treat all patients without crisis care and to broadly test health workers. If states were to strictly follow these guidelines, many would keep residents at home for several weeks before beginning the first of three gradual phases of an economic restart. The plan advises hitting these metrics again before moving on to subsequent, more open stages. 
The recommendations come with loopholes, however. And unfortunately the president has made it clear, with his talk of opening before the end of the month, that he’d like to see them used. 
The White House plan says “states and officials may need to tailor these criteria to local circumstances,” including in rural and suburban areas where outbreaks have been minimal. It also gives states the option of taking a county-by-county approach. 
If social distancing is loosened piecemeal in this way, however, people will be attracted to more open areas nearby, and may travel there, possibly bringing the virus and renewed outbreaks along with them. Trump’s plan adds to this risk by including sporting venues and places of worship in the first suggested phase of opening, if such places carry out distancing measures. And while the plan acknowledges that it might be good for neighboring states to cooperate with one another in reopening, it offers little in the way of detail or encouragement to do so. If neighbors of already-forming state coalitions open fast, and in a fragmented fashion, they may undermine the best-laid plans of the cooperating states.
“They will be able to go literally tomorrow because they’ve met all of the guidelines,” Trump said in announcing the plan Thursday. “We have large sections of the country right now that can start thinking about opening.”
It’s also possible that the states Trump sees opening soonest only look relatively safe from Covid-19 because of limited testing. Just a few weeks ago, South Dakota would have been in this category; now it’s a hot spot.
The reality is, data-based decision-making relies on accurate information and cautious interpretation. The distressingly vague phrase “downward trajectory,” which is incorporated into several of the plan’s gating criteria, gives states a lot of leeway to open too early based on unreliable data, and the president doesn’t seem inclined to complain if they do.
Without more testing, states won’t have an accurate picture of how far the virus is spreading. Existing flu-tracking infrastructure can help, but it can’t replace widespread Covid-19 screening.
The Trump administration has largely left testing efforts to states, and yet its reopening plan mandates frequent on-demand coronavirus tests — including for front-line workers. States are also supposed to conduct routine “sentinel” testing of vulnerable populations to catch early outbreaks, as well as widespread case intervention and contact tracing. These are excellent requirements. But governors with varying ability and limited information are left to their own devices to work out most of the details and implementation.
Finally, Trump’s plan calls on states to monitor what happens after they loosen social-distancing measures, and quickly return to them if the disease spreads again. This is a crucial fail-safe, and one that’s likely to see too much use."

Congress needs to figure out how to vote from afar.,"HOUSE SPEAKER Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has announced her support for allowing representatives to vote by proxy, a welcome change from Congress’s previous plan not to return to Washington until next month “absent an emergency.” Lawmakers in both chambers ought to get behind the idea as a first step in a broader strategy for legislating remotely. After all, we’re in an emergency already.
The novel coronavirus makes the business of in-person governing riskier than ever. Yet relying indefinitely on a voice-vote strategy just won’t work. The country needs a functional legislature to forge the pandemic response as democratically as possible; unanimous consent leaves little room for minority voices to make themselves heard without threatening to tank an entire lifesaving effort. The country also needs a legislature to conduct other essential business — not least the oversight of a president who this week threatened to adjourn Congress so that he may appoint his nominees without approval.
The plan for proxy voting comes from House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and would allow lawmakers who can’t return to Congress to delegate their votes to others who more easily could. It’s a low-lift, low-technology fix that serves well as a temporary measure. But it still prevents the rank and file from being able to debate, amend and negotiate as they did when it was still safe to sit within six feet of someone. For that, Congress must contemplate a higher-lift, higher-tech move toward virtual voting, hearings and markups in which all members can participate.
It won’t be easy. In fact, the voting itself may be the simplest part: Security concerns exist but shouldn’t be insurmountable. A Washington firm called Markup.Law has crafted a two-factor authentication system on spec and demonstrated it for decision-makers; Congress could also take the more traditional route of allowing members to phone in votes via a secure line, perhaps presenting themselves to the clerk on video as they do so. Result tallies are public anyway, so why not display them in a centralized location with a period for corrections? Facilitating floor motions and committee work will take more effort, but former officeholders tried out a mock hearing on Zoom this week to get things rolling.
There are legal roadblocks. Any form of remote voting will require rules changes — and authorizing those changes could require relying on the same voice-vote tactic this whole enterprise is designed to avoid. Even then, constitutional challenges may emerge. Any proposal also ought to ensure that these protocols are reserved only for emergencies. The drafts circulating so far demanding bipartisan approval to authorize 30 days of remote voting take the right approach.
Something is lost when politics has to happen from a distance. There won’t be any running into a friend from across the aisle in the House gym; deals made in the backroom might become deals made on Zoom. Leadership may miss the ability to speak to members individually and in person — to coax them into line and to learn from them, too. But many Americans are losing things right now, and Congress’s figuring out how to do its job amid the crisis would be to the rest of the country’s gain."
"April 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/congress-must-work-to-fund-small-businesses-instead-were-seeing-a-partisan-battle/2020/04/17/c7327e14-80d4-11ea-a3ee-13e1ae0a3571_story.html,The Washington Post,"Congress must work to fund small businesses. Instead, we’re seeing a partisan battle.","AFTER A rocky start, the Paycheck Protection Program, the $350 billion small-business rescue plan approved in March as part of the Cares Act, seems to be on its way to accomplishing Congress’s goal of enabling small companies to ride out the coronavirus storm without layoffs. The problem is that it has run out of money, after approving low-interest, forgivable loans to 1.6 million applicants. The program needs a second dose of funding — $250 billion, according to a request from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — to help finish the work and save more jobs. With unemployment spiking to Depression-era levels, Republicans and Democrats need to negotiate, urgently and in good faith, toward approval of the necessary funds.
So far, however, what’s been happening is a resurgence of the partisanship and vitriol that lawmakers had seemingly put behind them in passing the Cares Act unanimously. Without consulting Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) brought a $250 billion program extension to the floor, proposing it for passage by unanimous consent given the pandemic-enforced absence of most senators. When Democrats inevitably refused to play along, he and his party led a campaign of vilification against them. GOP operatives have been mocking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as an “ice queen” because she made a video in which she eats ice cream in front of her high-end kitchen refrigerator. President Trump chimed in with a tweet blasting her as “crazy” and “weak.” For their part, Democrats see the need for unanimous consent on an extension not only as a must for the economy but also as leverage for their wish list of funding and policy changes that go beyond the Cares Act agreement.
For all the sniping, a deal is probably possible and reasonable terms identifiable. The Paycheck Protection Program should get its $250 billion, and the GOP should at least partially meet Democrats’ demands for tens of billions more in hospital funding. It is true, as Republicans say, that the first $100 billion for hospitals already allocated in the Cares Act has not all been spent, but the money is bound to run out soon. Encouragingly, a key GOP leader, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), said Friday he would support more funding. Also needed is a substantial increase in a separate, preexisting Small Business Administration program, Economic Injury Disaster Loans, as an additional source of sustenance to hard-hit firms. Democrats should be willing to settle for a binding commitment to address state and local government needs when Congress can convene and vote on that massive item in person.
With communications broken down between Capitol Hill Democratic leaders and both Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, Mr. Mnuchin will have to do the Republicans’ bargaining with Ms. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), as he did in the final stages of Cares Act negotiations. This is a sorry state of affairs for a Congress seemingly intent on undoing the surge in public approval — to a 10-year high of 30 percent in the Gallup poll — that it had achieved through its earlier bipartisanship. With enough adults in the room, however, the parties may yet get to yes. They must do so, for the sake of their own reputations and, more important, for the sake of the country."
"April 18, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trumps-reopening-guidance-has-a-glaring-gap/2020/04/17/9efb793a-80d6-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html,The Washington Post,Trump’s reopening guidance has a glaring gap,"THE WHITE HOUSE guidance titled “Opening Up America Again” released Thursday evening comes with a reasonable aspiration for a phased recovery that does not ignite a fresh outbreak of the novel coronavirus. President Trump wisely didn’t repeat his misguided assertion of total authority. But this new guidance has a glaring gap: Who will address the enormous bottleneck of diagnostic testing, which remains far below what is needed to reopen the country?
Mr. Trump’s guidance to governors and local officials envisions robust testing that does not yet exist. The testing would help isolate the sick so the well could return to work. Mr. Trump said in a conference call to governors on Thursday, “You’re going to call your own shots.” He is pushing them off in a canoe with a smile — and saying good luck finding a paddle.
They cannot do it alone. The United States cannot return to normal without mass testing, and the existing system is inadequate. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, said correctly, “This has to be figured out. I understand that this is a problematic area, and the federal government’s not eager to get involved in testing. I get that, but the plain reality here is we have to do it in partnership with the federal government.”
Judging by his briefing Thursday evening, Mr. Trump does not get it. But his own advisers seem to realize what they are up against. The Post reports that Mr. Trump’s team was thinking of requiring that most workers get tested before going back to work but eventually settled on seeking testing for a far more limited set of four key groups: health-care workers, food-safety workers, those in nursing homes and people with chronic diseases. That alone may require millions more tests that don’t exist. And what about everyone else?
Before the pandemic, the U.S. workforce was about 157 million people. The total tests to date in the United States, 3.4 million as of Friday, would have to be multiplied roughly 23 times just to reach half of the pre-pandemic workforce. Even if the dimensions are less because of job losses, this would seem to be a colossal problem demanding Mr. Trump’s leadership.
Aside from the current scattershot U.S. approach to testing, another major challenge is supply shortages. The diagnostic tests, no matter who does them, require specialized chemicals, known as reagents. The pandemic created a global supply shock. Much of the supply came from China, and it will take time to build infrastructure for more. A separate type of testing, serology, which checks for antibodies in those people who have recovered from infection, currently has sufficient supply, but a shortage is coming there, too. Swabs are a critical element in testing and also scarce.
If Mr. Trump were really in a take-charge mood, he would convene a task force to figure out how to overcome these very real obstacles. The toll taken by leadership failure is growing by the hour."

The U.S. Small Business Administration processed applications from all 50 states and territories totaling $342.3 billion out of the $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program before the agency stopped accepting applications, the report released Friday shows. The balance of funding is for fees and processing, officials have said.
Lawmakers continue to negotiate for additional funding with many small businesses still waiting to apply or get approved for a loan. The amount is what has been approved for lenders to disburse, and there’s no comprehensive accounting of how much funding has been received so far by small businesses.
The average loan amount processed was $206,000, with 74% of the applications for $150,000 or less and about 4% for $1 million or more, data show. The program, enacted last month as part of a $2.2 trillion relief package, offers loans of as much as $10 million. The loans convert to grants if proceeds are used to keep workers on the payroll and cover rent and other approved expenses for about two months, a stopgap designed to help businesses get by until the economy reopens.
Firms in Texas had the most applications approved at 134,737 for $28.5 billion in loans, while California had the largest amount in loans at $33.4 billion, data show. California officials had complained they appeared to be getting shortchanged when initial results were released Monday.
The industries that received the largest share of loans were construction; professional, scientific and technical services; manufacturing; and health care and social assistance, according to the report.
Almost 5,000 lenders participated, with significant lending by community banks and credit unions, according to the release from Treasury and SBA. Almost 20% of the amount approved was processed by lenders with less than $1 billion in assets, and about 60% from banks with $10 billion or less in assets. No lender accounted for more than 5% of the total amount, the release said."

A Chicago doctor who had tested it on severely ill patients suggested it was working — that most of those who were given the medicine recovered and were discharged. The market is reacting as if the drug were already a commercial hit: Gilead shares have been up as much as 12% in early trading. 
Investors should be clear about what this report is and isn’t, however. It is a promising anecdote that suggests the drug might be useful. It is also extremely limited information from a small portion of a trial taken out of context. In other words, it’s miles from providing proof that remdesivir cures Covid-19. The story is even further from being a reasonable basis for a multibillion-dollar stock move.
Anecdotal data gets people excited, especially when it sends a message they want to hear. But it’s not especially good at predicting whether a drug will work. Just a few weeks ago, similar anecdotal reports suggested that hydroxychloroquine, an older malaria drug, could be a Covid-19 miracle medicine. More robust trials show side effects and limited efficacy. 
Before this video emerged, the data on remdesivir was mixed. A New England Journal of Medicine report on compassionate use of the medicine also suggested promise, but it was likewise anecdotal. On the other hand, Chinese researchers running extensive controlled studies on it recently stopped them. A slowing outbreak hurt enrollment. However, RW Baird & Co. analyst Brian Skorney argues that if the drug looked as effective as the Stat report suggests, those researchers would “certainly” have reported data.
The Stat report has sparked particular exuberance because it highlights significant effects in very sick patients — evoking images of people being brought back from death’s door. But in selecting severely ill patients, this trial screened out those requiring mechanical ventilation and those with multi-organ failure or kidney or liver impairment, according to Skorney. That leaves a group of patients who probably had a better chance of recovery from the start, with or without remdesivir. 
The Chicago hospital is just one site in a larger Gilead-sponsored study that lacks a control arm. Even when all the data are in, it will be difficult to know how well these patients might have done with supportive care or other therapies. The world may need to wait longer for a more conclusive verdict from a double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial that’s being run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
Even if the NIAID study succeeds, or the FDA approves the medicine based on earlier data, remdesivir isn’t certain to become a financial or medical blockbuster. The drug may work only relatively early in the course of a coronavirus infection. And because doctors must infuse it over several days, its uses are somewhat limited. The manufacturing process is also long and complicated, and political pressure will keep Gilead from pricing aggressively. 
Absent superlative real data or a manufacturing breakthrough, it’s hard to imagine sales of the medicine justifying the addition of billions to Gilead’s market cap. By fall, we’ll have data from immunosuppressive drugs that have generated promising anecdotal data of their own and from novel antibodies that may supplant remdesivir. 
The best hope for Gilead’s drug is that it will become part of the toolkit for fighting Covid-19. Realizing that promise will take much more than a video."
"April 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/saudi-arabia-shouldspendlike-the-debtor-it-is/2020/04/17/bd44c7ae-8110-11ea-84c2-0792d8591911_story.html,The Washington Post,Saudi Arabia Should Spend Like the Debtor It Is,"There’s a certain devil-may-care glamour about going on a shopping spree when you’re already living beyond your means. It’s probably not the best way to convince your creditors to keep putting up the cash, however. 
Saudi Arabia might want to reflect on that after its recent splurge on oil companies, cruise ships and soccer. In the past month, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund has bought or been linked to plans to buy an 8.2% stake in cruise operator Carnival Corp.; about 80% of Newcastle United Football Club; and holdings in Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, Eni SpA and Equinor ASA. 
Alarmingly, the most sensible item on that shopping list may well be the 13th-placed team in the English Premier League. Carnival shares, for instance, are already down by about a third since the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund completed its acquisition of stock in the business last month.
A country as over-exposed to crude as Saudi Arabia shouldn’t be using its sovereign wealth fund to buy more oil, either. Equinor’s controlling shareholder, the state of Norway, last year instructed its pension fund to sell off investments in upstream oil and gas, so as to “make the government’s wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices.” Saudi Arabia is doing the opposite.
Even the PIF’s more prudent attempts to diversify its exposures into businesses distant from oil demand haven’t panned out so well. A pre-listing investment of $3.5 billion in Uber Technologies Inc. is worth less than $2 billion now. Its 38% stake in South Korea’s Posco Engineering & Construction Co. has lost more than two-thirds of its value since it was bought in 2015. And the kingdom managed to sell out of Tesla Inc. before its extraordinary rally at the start of the year.
As rich heirs have known since time immemorial, a string of failed business ventures doesn’t need to cramp your style as long as that endowment cash keeps flowing — but the problem for Saudi Arabia is that, as we’ve argued, those days are fast running out.
As recently as 2014, years of outsize profits on crude had left the government sitting on net assets equivalent to 47% of gross domestic product. Since then, lower prices and incontinent spending have eroded Saudi Arabia’s nest egg with astonishing speed. Net debt will hit 19% of GDP this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, before rising to 27% next year, while coronavirus and oil-fight measures could push gross borrowing to 50% by 2022.
That’s still modest by rich-country standards, but none is as leveraged as Saudi Arabia is to the price of a single commodity, as my colleague Liam Denning has written. Barring extraordinary cuts to its budget or a 2008-style oil price spike, the kingdom is likely to remain a net debtor for the foreseeable future. 
Lenders already appear to be taking notice. Thanks to the general virus-inspired market panic and the specific effects of the current oil-price war, five-year credit default swaps insuring against non-payment of Saudi Arabia’s debt are currently running at about 179 basis points. That puts the country in the company of India, Indonesia, and Russia in terms of perceived credit risks, and far worse than the likes of Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Iceland.
Its sovereign bonds still have a weighted average coupon of 3.43% and maturity in the latter half of 2030, so for the moment things seem comfortable enough. But lower-for-longer oil prices could cause that outlook to unwind remarkably quickly, especially if the kingdom’s fast-shrinking foreign reserves start putting pressure on the riyal’s dollar peg.
Despite the PIF’s shopping spree, there are signs that Riyadh is aware of how constrained its circumstances are starting to become. Last week’s announcement of a ceasefire in the bloody five-year war in Yemen is welcome for humanitarian reasons — but it’s also necessary on a more pragmatic level. Saudi Arabia’s military spending is the third-biggest globally after the U.S. and China, and amounts to an extraordinary 8.8% of GDP — the highest share of any country for which the World Bank has recent data.
The ceasefire is being attributed to the impact of Covid-19, but it’s hard not to notice that military spending this year will fall to its lowest level in a decade. When the finances get tight, you just don’t have the money to spend on a quagmire that you once did.
That willingness to make cuts is welcome — but once you add the amounts dedicated to domestic security, some 28% of Saudi Arabia’s budget is still going on such expenditures. It’s not surprising that a government lacking popular legitimacy in the middle of a strife-torn region should be spending a lot of money on self-preservation. Still, a country where 40% of the 33 million-strong population is under 25 might want to invest more on health, education and other longer-term goals.
It’s probably that 1 trillion riyal ($271 billion) government budget, rather than splashy overseas acquisitions, where the biggest savings need to be made right now. The message is the same, though: Riyadh needs to start cutting its coat according to its cloth, and fast."
"April 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/20/shake-shack-loan-coronavirus/,The Washington Post,Shake Shack to return $10 million government loan intended for small businesses,"Shake Shack is returning all $10 million it received from a federal loan program intended to help small businesses amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the burger chain announced in a statement late Sunday.
“Our people would benefit from a $10 million [Paycheck Protection Program] loan but we’re fortunate to now have access to capital that others do not,” the company’s executives, Danny Meyer and Randy Garutti, wrote in a letter shared on LinkedIn. “Until every restaurant that needs it has had the same opportunity to receive assistance, we’re returning ours.”
The decision comes shortly after Shake Shack was identified in recent media reports as one of multiple large companies with revenue of more than $100 million that obtained loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, which maxed out last week and stopped accepting claims. The $350 billion lending program, a central part of the massive $2.2 trillion stimulus passed last month, is meant to incentivize small businesses to keep people employed through loans that are forgivable if the workers are kept on payroll, according to the Small Business Administration.
But as CNN reported over the weekend, scores of small businesses have had their loan applications rejected while larger companies including restaurant chains, hoteliers and other publicly traded corporations have received amounts in the millions.
In Sunday’s letter, Meyer, Shake Shack’s founder, and Garutti, the CEO, explained the chain initially applied for federal assistance because it qualified under a stipulation that loans could be paid out to any restaurant location with no more than 500 employees. Though Shake Shack has 189 locations, each individual restaurant only employs about roughly 45 people, the letter said.
“The ‘PPP’ came with no user manual and it was extremely confusing,” Meyer and Garutti wrote. “The best chance of keeping our teams working, off the unemployment line and hiring back our furloughed and laid off employees, would be to apply now and hope things would be clarified in time.”
The burger chain wasn’t the only large restaurant business to benefit from the program, CNN reported. Potbelly Sandwich Shop, Ruth’s Chris steak houses, and Kura Sushi USA, one of the largest sushi chains in the country, among others, all received sizable loans, according to CNN.
Meyer and Garutti said Sunday they were not aware the federal program would be overwhelmed so quickly and acknowledged the outcry stemming from independent businesses that were not able to secure loans. The decision to return the $10 million loan was made immediately after Shake Shack secured separate funding last Friday “needed to ensure our long term stability,” the letter said.
The two executives went on to urge Congress to make sure that moving forward the program is adequately funded, writing, “It’s inexcusable to leave restaurants out because no one told them to get in line by the time the funding dried up.”
“If this health crisis and the associated economic shock has taught us anything, it is that we are all in this together,” Meyer and Garutti wrote. “Restaurants and their employees are craving the moment when we can safely be back in business and bring our guests back to the table. With adequate funding and some necessary tweaks, the PPP program can provide the economic spark the entire industry needs to get back in business.”"

The $349 billion federal relief package for small companies ran out in less than two weeks, leaving many mom and pop store owners shut out after spending days desperately trying to get a lifeline for their business and employees. Among those who succeeded in getting a government-backed loan, some say they fret about an uncertain future past the two months of relief the program provides.
With efforts stalled in Washington to provide more funding, reality on the ground is often grim, particularly for very small businesses with a few employees. The median firm with monthly expenses of $10,000 has only enough cash on hand to last two weeks, according to in a recent survey published in a National Bureau of Economic Research paper. 
Millions of business owners across the country are struggling to get by. Their voices are rarely heard. Some are contemplating shutting their businesses, others are looking ahead at an eventual reopening. Here are some of them, reflecting on the month past and looking at their future:
Ordering Thermometers
At 9.25 a.m. on April 3, Bobby Lance got an email from his bank telling him to get ready for the government’s small business lending program that was about to go live online in five minutes. He then spent the next 60 minutes at his computer furiously clicking on his mouse to submit his application. “It was an anxious time,” he said of the early days in April, adding that he sometimes drank two glasses of wine to help calm his nerves.
Those days almost seems a distant memory now. Lance, who owns Sweet Dreams Ice Cream Café and two other food businesses just outside Disney World in Orlando, Florida, has since applied for another government loan, got up to speed with everything from pathogens to virus testing, and shared what he has learned with other business owners. And now he’s focusing on business in a post-lockdown world.
While Lance waits to hear whether he’ll get federal funding, the 66-year-old is preparing for an eventual reopening. He has ordered masks and plastic face shields for his five employees, thermometers to check their temperatures and looked into “hospital quality” sanitation training for them, he said. Lance has also got quotes from sanitation companies to perform more regular deep-cleaning of his 1950s-style ice cream cafe and he’s started designing plexiglass dividers for its back-to-back seating booths.
“You’re numb at first, but then have to carry on and be positive,” he said. “I’ve been in business for 42 years and I couldn’t live with myself if I caused someone to get sick.”
Painful Layoffs
Justin Catalana, the founder of San Francisco-based Fort Point Beer Company, took painful and early action in the face of Covid-19.
Over the weekend of March 13, ahead of Bay Area cities announcing shelter-in-place orders, the brewer laid off 70 of its 200 staff and shuttered the three bars and restaurants that it owns. The layoffs continued through March and were done so staff could seek unemployment insurance. As of Friday, the company had 65 employees.
Sales to the city’s bars and restaurants have completely dried up. But there is one bright spot: Business with grocery chains and corner stores are up significantly.
“We will mould the business around whatever is generating the most revenue,” Catalana said. “We hope that we are going to be operating at around 40% of what our revenue was projected to be for the next couple of months.”
Catalana’s plan is based around the shelter-in-place orders lasting at least 12 weeks, through to the end of May.
The company applied for the federal Paycheck Protection Program rescue fund and received confirmation the loan’s been approved. However, it has yet to receive any funds. It also applied for the other federal program, called Economic Injury Disaster Loan, and is still waiting on those funds.
Catalana has also continued to pay rent across his three retail locations, including a prime spot on the front of San Francisco’s Ferry Building. His hope: he will be able to reopen all three of the bars and restaurants and hire back the staff, eventually. He is in talks with landlords over relief.
`Keeping Me Up at Night’
John Dantzler has been working on the business plan for his own restaurant and brewery since 2008. He was days away from opening in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood when coronavirus hit.
“In a lot of ways, it was pretty rough timing for us,” he said. “We basically shifted our entire business model overnight.”
Now the CEO and co-founder of Torch & Crown Brewing Co. has morphed his restaurant property into a distribution hub, and is so far keeping his 20 employees busy with beer deliveries in New York. Dantzler himself also is bringing brews to people stuck at home with his 2003 Lexus SUV -- an old car that “roars” and already has 215,000 miles on it.
“You can fit a lot of beer in that, we’ve learned,” he said. ”It’s definitely not how we drew it up in the business plan a few years ago. But it’s getting the job done.”
Delivering 4-packs of brew is helping for now, but revenue is just 40% of what it would have been. Dantzler has been approved for between $150,000 and $200,000 through the payroll protection program, but says he’s unsure if it will come through because he keeps reading about how all the funding has been used up. And even if he does get a check, it will only last him for about a month of staff salaries.
“It’s keeping me up at night,” he said. “What happens when the money runs out -- and we still don’t know if we’ll be open or not.”
`Really Frightening’
John Naekel co-owns four bars with two other partners in Portland, Oregon. All of the bars have be closed with all hourly staff laid off since March 16. Initially he kept salaried managers for two weeks with the hope that it would be brief but had to lay them off as well.
The process of applying for the federal rescue loans has been confusing and frustrating. The loans in the payroll protection program, designed as a short-term stopgap until the economy reopens, convert to grants if proceeds are used to cover salaries over about two months and other approved expenses such as rent. It created a conundrum for many business owners whose locations are shut down under state orders: Shall they rehire their workers?
“We can’t pay them to do nothing and we don’t know when are going to reopen,” Naekel said earlier in April. “What if we come back and the new rule for bars and restaurants is they need to operate at half capacity and stay six feet apart -- our business model is we can’t operate at half capacity. If that’s where we are headed, then it may not make sense to ever reopen. I don’t care what amount of money if we can’t reopen. That part of it is really frightening.”
`Wizard of Oz’
Erik Bruun owns SoCo Creamery, an ice cream shop and wholesale supplier in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. He was told Monday April 13 that his application for a Paycheck Protection Program  loan had been approved, but he has yet to receive any funds.
“I’m very grateful for it, and I understand that these things take time, but there’s a clock that’s ticking for my business and I have to take different steps to hold back time until the loan comes through,” he said. “The lender I work with couldn’t be nicer, couldn’t be more responsive, but she’s in front of a system that you can’t see behind. The money is coming from the Wizard of Oz.”
He rehired some of part-time workers, based on getting the government-back funding. He believes he’ll get the funding at some point but is overcome with a sense of uncertainty in general.
”When and how we will get back to a new normal is the question,” he said. “As an ice cream business, we look forward to summertime, and there’s always this feeling that summer may never come.”
`Nobody’s Lending’
Lisa Leder is a casting director and photo producer who has worked with companies of all sizes -- from small businesses to Estee Lauder Cos. and Levi Strauss & Co. She has owned and operated LL Production and Casting in New York City since 2005. 
“I had money and was doing amazing in March,” Leder said. “Everything was halted on March 12, so all of the money I was counting on to pay people from is gone. I’ve never been in this situation before. I’ve never been late in my life paying a vendor.”
Leder is the sole employee, which has complicated getting aid. She’s applied for every loan she possibly could: the Paycheck Protection Program and another federal program called Economic Injury Disaster Loan, as well as New York City programs. She’s heard nothing.
The way her business operates is she usually gets a budget from a client and money in advance, and then pays people to do the job. At this time last year, she had brought $70,000 in gross for the month of March. At the beginning of the month, she had brought in $13,000 and is now stuck trying to come up with the $50,000 she estimates she owes.
The past month has been nerve-wracking and infuriating. When she called the Small Business Administration a week and a half ago and asked about the status of her application, the representative replied he “had no idea” how to check the status, she said.
“Nobody’s lending,” she said. “Unless you’re really rich or really poor, you get nothing.”"

China has also been making it easier for foreigners to buy its stocks and bonds — something many fund managers are required to do now that major index compilers are including Chinese assets in their gauges, to the dismay of some U.S. politicians. Financial regulators in Beijing say the liberalization drive will continue. The take-up is gathering pace but the going has been tough, even before the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
1. What’s the change?
China is allowing full foreign ownership of life insurers, futures and mutual fund companies this year -- in stages. Foreign ownership caps for securities firms came off April 1 as part of the trade agreement signed with the U.S. in January. China also pledged to take no longer than 90 days to decide on applications from electronic-payment service providers, including for wholly foreign-owned operations. Regulators cleared the way for full takeovers of local banks by foreigners in 2019, a year after it eased ownership caps. Foreign companies can now also be lead underwriters for all types of bonds, and can control wealth management firms, pension fund managers and inter-dealer brokers. The Shanghai-London Stock Connect officially kicked off in June 2019, allowing companies listed on one bourse to trade shares on the other. (Almost a year later, however, only a single company had taken advantage of it.) An earlier program linked Hong Kong with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.
2. Who’s diving in?
Quite a few companies:
3. What’s the lure?
China’s $45 trillion financial services industry. Even a sliver can be lucrative. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that -- barring a major economic slowdown or change of course -- foreign banks and securities companies could be raking in profits of more than $9 billion a year in China by 2030. Wealth management firms are looking at a market poised to reach $30 trillion in assets by 2023, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman. Guo Shuqing, China’s chief banking regulator, sees significant room for foreign investors: They held just 1.6% of banking assets and 5.8% of the insurance market as of May 2019, he said. The percentages have fluctuated; in 2007, for example, the foreign share of Chinese banking assets was 2.3%.
4. What barriers remain?
The threat of financial decoupling looms with the Trump administration looking at restrictions on U.S. investments in Chinese companies and financial markets, a possible new front in the trade war. (China declared it would continue to open markets and encourage foreign investment.) There are also plenty of hidden barriers, including the challenge of cracking a market dominated by government-controlled rivals that have longstanding relationships with clients. The lengthy and often opaque application process also can be a deterrence. Visa, for example, has been waiting since 2015. On top of all that, China’s gross domestic product shrank the most on a quarterly basis since at least 1992 as the world struggles with the pandemic.
5. What about stocks and bonds?
They’re being slowly added to widely followed global benchmarks, including stock indexes by MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell and, for bonds, the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and JPMorgan’s GBI-EM indexes. That’s expected to draw tens of billions of dollars in purchases initially from funds that track those gauges.
6. How’s that going?
Bumpy. In late 2019 MSCI said it wouldn’t add any more yuan-denominated shares until China fixed long-standing concerns over market access. And not every opening is met with enthusiasm: Foreign investors had bought only a third of the total allotment at the time regulators scrapped the quota system for Chinese stocks and bonds in September. Market turbulence in recent years, including major stock sell-offs, has dampened interest. Some investors also worry about being unable to repatriate their money due to China’s capital controls. (The government has long kept a tight grip on money flowing in and out so as to preserve the value of its currency, the yuan.)
7. What’s in it for China?
The benefits may be twofold: U.S. President Donald Trump accuses China of being a one-sided beneficiary of global commerce, so opening up makes the trade seem more balanced. And Chinese leaders have long described the moves as a useful way to improve the competitiveness of the domestic industry -- without challenging its dominance -- as well as to allocate capital more efficiently and attract foreign investment. Central bank governor Yi Gang has described the moves as “prudent, cautious, gradualist.”"
"April 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/20/why-joe-biden-could-swing-votes-by-campaigning-legalize-marijuana/,The Washington Post,Why Joe Biden could swing votes by campaigning to legalize marijuana,"Today is 4/20, the holiday for marijuana enthusiasts around the world.
More Americans are likely to celebrate 4/20 today than ever before. Cannabis sales reportedly skyrocketed just before the coronavirus pandemic began locking down most of the country. One survey similarly showed that marijuana use reached records heights last month.
Marijuana has even become a winning political issue, with a remarkable rise in public support for legalization over the past two decades. Two-thirds of Americans back legal recreational use, up from one-third 20 years ago.
But the political benefits of running on legalization extend beyond that. Legalization is popular in swing states and among swing voters. It’s also one of the only policies that is important to voters across the political spectrum. Together, those facts make marijuana an especially potent campaign issue.
Most voters in every state support marijuana legalization
Recreational marijuana use for adults over the age of 21 is legal in only 11 states, but marijuana legalization has broad support throughout the country.
The map above shows that a majority of voters in every state supports legalization. Over the past three years, the polling firm Civiqs has asked 140,000 registered voters their opinions about legal cannabis. Scrolling across the map shows those results by state. You can see by doing so that statewide support for legalization ranges from about 55 percent in North Dakota to about 79 percent in Oregon and Washington.
More importantly, the map shows that marijuana legalization is also popular in the handful of battleground states that will determine who wins the 2020 presidential election. Swing-state support for legal cannabis ranges from a low 65 percent in Minnesota to a high of 67 percent in New Hampshire.
Undecided and third-party voters support legal cannabis
Marijuana isn’t just popular in swing states. It’s also popular with swing voters. We can look at how small, but potentially pivotal, groups feel about legalization in the UCLA/Nationscape data, an enormous academic survey that has interviewed more than 200,000 registered voters since the summer of 2019.
The graph above shows public opinion about marijuana legalization among undecided 2020 voters, third-party voters from 2016 and pure independents who don’t lean toward one of the two major parties.
As you can see, independent and undecided voters support marijuana legalization by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Americans who voted for Gary Johnson and Jill Stein in 2016 — third-party candidates who both made marijuana legalization central to their presidential bids — even more strongly support legalizing cannabis.
Marijuana legalization is important to voter
It’s one thing to say that voters support legalizing marijuana. It’s quite another to say they would actually vote for a presidential candidate based on this policy.
Americans rarely vote for president based on a single issue. Voters are much more likely to change their opinions about significant campaign issues based on their previous opinions about the candidates than they are to change their votes based on the candidates’ positions on issues.
Nevertheless, a few issues arouse so much passion that candidates’ positions sometimes matter. Opinions about immigration policy, for example, strongly predicted voting for candidates from different parties in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.
Marijuana legalization appears to be one of these strongly held, gut-level issues, too. Political science research from the 1970s found that Americans as a whole held stronger views about marijuana than just about any other public policy.
A much newer study also shows that marijuana legalization is one of the more important issues to voters. To better understand voter priorities, political scientists Lynn Vavreck, John Sides and Chris Tausanovitch embedded a series of innovative “conjoint experiments” into the UCLA/Nationscape survey. The experiments forced voters to decide repeatedly from among random collections of policy outcomes. Those repeated choices revealed the relative importance of more than 50 prominent issues.
When Vavreck and colleagues presented their results, they showed a clear pattern: Marijuana legalization was not only popular across the political spectrum, but it was also one of the more important issues to Democrats, Republicans and independents.
Of course, legalizing marijuana was not as important to voters as the most polarizing issues of the day, such as impeachment and the border wall. But it was a more important priority to voters than any of the fiscal issues that dominate so much political debate, such as taxes and health care, especially among pure independents who do not lean toward either party.
Implications for 2020
To be sure, the popularity of marijuana legalization and its importance to many voters would only matter in a close 2020 election. Most voters are already locked into their choices, given how polarized party supporters are and how strongly Americans feel about President Trump.
But the data still suggest that Joe Biden is missing a big political opportunity to run on legalization in a presidential campaign in which Democrats face an uphill battle in the electoral college. Although Biden’s position on marijuana policy is more lenient than Trump’s, he remains opposed to full legalization in the United States.
Biden has repeatedly defended his position on legal cannabis by saying that the policy’s impact still needs to be studied. The political impact, however, is unambiguous: Marijuana legalization is a winning campaign issue."
"April 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/20/joe-biden-scores-endorsement-big-spending-green-group/,The Washington Post,Joe Biden scores endorsement from big-spending green group,"Former vice president Joe Biden notched an endorsement from a major environmental group — and is signaling he will expand his climate plan in an effort to win over young voters who see rising global temperatures as a generational crisis.
The political arm of the League of Conservation Voters, a Washington-based green group that has spent tens of millions of dollars in recent election cycles to help elect Democrats to office, announced Monday that it is backing the presumptive Democratic nominee in what looks to be a tough fight against President Trump.
Drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions “is going to take leadership,” said Carol Browner, the chair of LCV’s board of directors. “And I have every confidence that the vice president will provide that.”
The endorsement from the LCV could encourage other green groups who supported Biden’s rivals in a crowded primary to fall in line. The group hopes to prevent Trump, who has repeatedly denied the scientific consensus that human activity is warming the planet, from winning a second term.
“Scientists tell us we have 10 years” to get climate change under control, said Browner, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency for eight years under former president Bill Clinton. “We’re going to have to not just put back in place all the stuff that Trump undid from the Obama years, we’re going to have to do more.”
Biden said in a statement that he was “honored” to have the LCV’s endorsement. “For me, this is personal,” said Biden, a former senator from Delaware. “I live in a state that’s dealing first hand with the impacts of climate change and impacts of pollution on kids and families. I’m going to fight for my grandkids.”
But even after the departure of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) from the race this month, Biden may face a tough time winning over some environmental activists on the party’s left who say his plan for tackling climate change falls short of what is needed to forestall a devastating rise in temperatures this century.
Biden, without offering specifics, said in his statement that he wanted to adopt ideas from climate activists and set other “new, concrete goals” for combating climate change before the end of the decade.
“In the months ahead, expanding this plan will be one of my key objectives,” Biden said. “I know this is an issue that resonates with many, including young people and those who have seen floods, fires, and drought destroy lives and livelihoods.”
Biden’s original 22-page climate plan, released last June, calls for the United States to achieve net-zero emissions by at least 2050, all while creating 10 million well-paying jobs and helping fossil fuel workers transition to a clean-energy economy.
Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director, said the campaign “always had an expectation that we will continue to build upon that policy.”
Biden scored his first endorsement from an environmental group, the National Wildlife Federation’s political arm, after posting big wins in last month’s Super Tuesday primary.
But most green groups who backed a candidate endorsed either Sanders or fellow liberal stalwart Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). A handful of local chapters of the Sunrise Movement, which endorsed Sanders, went so far as to insist that it would never back Biden even if he won the nomination.
After years of being an afterthought at the polls, climate change emerged as a top issue in the Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada primaries, ranking second in importance after health care in exit polling.
But it remains to be seen whether the slow-burning crisis of global warming will still be top of mind for voters in November given the coronavirus pandemic, which is raising widespread public health concerns and shuttering the economy.
Even though Trump’s bully pulpit is now arguably bigger than ever, LCV leaders predict that Trump’s handling of the latest crisis will prove unpopular with those who already oppose his moves to dismantle environmental regulations for the past three years.
Tiernan Sittenfeld, the LCV’s senior vice president of government affairs, says the two issues are tied together since both have to do with heeding the advice of scientists.
Trump “ignores experts. He insists that he knows better,” Sittenfeld said. “He clearly is a danger to the health and safety of all people in this country.”
The LCV pumped more than $80 million into the 2018 election to help Democrats win control of the House. “That was a record,” Browner said, “and we believe we can set another record this time.”
The group has also poured $14 million into an online advertising and direct-mail campaign attacking Trump’s environmental record in six swing states — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin."
"April 20, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/20/its-not-about-size-government-its-about-competence/,The Washington Post,It’s not about the size of the government. It’s about competence.,"Republicans who voted for a massive debt-producing tax cut, supported anti-terrorism surveillance, routinely demanded increases in defense spending, shamelessly shoveled federal funds into their states (for opioid treatment, disaster relief and other needs) and have never had the nerve to curtail let alone cut spending for Social Security or Medicare would have us believe they have been protectors of “limited” government. Republicans have also long favored government intervention in the war on drugs, limiting access to abortions and regulating marriage. However, they say now they are “worried” the coronavirus may be a game-changer. Really?
The Post’s Dan Balz captures the fiscal fairy tale Republicans are telling themselves:
Give me a break. “Normal” was record debt and expansion of the spending initiatives and government activities referenced above. And, of course, many of the very actions we see now were based on 2008 legislative models (e.g., TARP, the auto bailout) that many of them supported.
Certainly there are specific policy items now even Republicans have come around to support such as more spending for health care and paid leave. However, the real tipping point — and the danger for the right wing — is the affirmation that competent government is critical and performs functions that cannot be fobbed off on lower levels of government or the private sector.
New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo commented at his daily news conference Sunday, “Government matters today in a way that it hasn’t mattered in decades.” Government has to be competently run with a bureaucracy that has not been dismembered (compare New York or California with the executive branch of the federal government under President Trump). It has to be properly funded (one of three stimulus bills came in with a sticker price of about $2 trillion, more than doubling the 2009 stimulus of about $830 billion). It has to be data driven, informed by experts and communicated clearly and quickly.
The affirmation of the importance of good government is seen in the sky-high approval ratings of governors and the lousy ratings Trump receives. It is seen in the overwhelming priority that voters place on continuing stay-at-home measures that experts recommended and states imposed over vague calls to restart the economy because, Republicans apparently believe, the lesser of two evils is supposed to be allowing thousands more to die.
Republicans have not been serious about limited federal government since Calvin Coolidge. What actually changed over time and reached its zenith under Trump was antagonism toward government and resentment toward elites and expertise. Whether you think this resulted from economic strain brought on by globalization or, as I do, racial and cultural resentment among white, evangelical and non-urban Americans, Trumpian Republicans lauded the denigration and antagonism toward government (egged on by business interests and ideological right-wing donors).
Now, the painful, deadly lesson is laid bare. No significant segment of voters actually wants government to be small. The issue is what you want government to do and how well you want it to perform. The 2008 financial crash and now the covid-19 pandemic have reminded many that one party does not give two hoots about running government well, which in a crisis means it will spectacularly fail to protect Americans."

In practice, Donald Trump is president.
Trump’s daily “briefings” on the covid-19 pandemic offer an unprecedented challenge to both the media and the general public. If journalists take seriously our responsibility to report truth rather than falsehoods, we need to devise some sort of filter — a mental analog to the face masks that so many Americans now wear to keep from contaminating others.
These stage-managed afternoon performances are not really briefings at all. Sometimes, they are campaign rallies designed to stoke passion among Trump’s loyal base. Sometimes they are blame-shifting exercises in which he points the fingers at governors, Democrats, China, the World Health Organization — even the previous administration — for not leaving behind a test for a disease that did not infect humans until nearly three years after Barack Obama left office.
Increasingly, these unhinged sessions primarily serve as opportunities for Trump to complain bitterly about how nobody appreciates what a “perfect” job he and his administration have done in handling the pandemic. Since this narrative is objectively false, Trump has to bluster and fantasize to try to make it sound true, if only to himself.
The president uses the assembled White House correspondents as foils. Protocol and decency require them to treat him with respect, addressing him as “Mr. President” and refraining from, say, calling him a liar to his face. By contrast, Trump often berates them for asking perfectly appropriate questions.
On Sunday, when CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond asked why Trump was highlighting praise for his administration on a day the U.S. death toll from covid-19 soared past 40,000, Trump snapped at Diamond that “you don’t have the brains you were born with.” The president has seemed to go out of his way to target women of color among the press corps, frequently snarling at Yamiche Alcindor of “PBS NewsHour” and telling reporter Weijia Jiang of CBS News to “keep your voice down.”
Trump may believe these daily appearances are good politics, but it’s unclear why. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday showed that just 36 percent of respondents generally trust what Trump says about the novel coronavirus, as opposed to 66 percent who trust the governors of their states and 60 percent who believe Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
From the point of view of former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, an old political maxim might seem to apply: Never interfere with your opponent when he is in the process of destroying himself. Trump can never resist the spotlight, however harsh and unsparing it might be — and no matter how little he understands the material.
Whatever he’s doing to his political standing, though, Trump is clearly making the task of the nation’s governors and public health officials much more difficult. He has begun lobbying for restarting the economy by May 1 or even earlier, despite warnings from Fauci and other scientists that reopening too soon would risk inviting a new wave of infections, hospitalizations and deaths that likely would mean yet another shutdown.
The president’s impatience has helped inspire demonstrations at statehouses around the country calling for stay-at-home orders to be lifted. Anyone who doubts there is a cause-and-effect relationship should note the prevalence of MAGA hats and pro-Trump signs among the protesters.
So what should the media do? I’ve always believed the convention that what the president of the United States says qualifies as news. But with Trump, even the most fundamental beliefs must be reexamined.
In print, we need to find ways not to amplify Trump’s lies in the process of refuting them. Perhaps that means providing the accurate, corrective information before quoting the lie, even in headlines. That is difficult, but not impossible.
Broadcast media should consider either taping the briefings and airing only newsworthy excerpts, or providing some means of fact-checking Trump’s statements in real time. Split the screen, if necessary. Cut away altogether when things go completely off the rails.
Should the White House correspondents walk out en masse? No, because covering the president is their job. Making a pact to follow up on questions Trump refuses to answer truthfully won’t work: Trump can back up a lie with another lie, or just walk away.
But the correspondents do have another option: When Trump finishes a fact-free opening harangue, they should direct their questions to Fauci and the other experts — not to the president. Reporters are there to seek reliable information on behalf of the public, not to play Trump’s self-serving game. "

Epidemiology falls squarely in that category.
Consider a recent Chinese study that traced a cluster of covid-19 infections to a restaurant in Guangzhou. On Jan. 24, a total of 91 people (83 customers, eight staff) were together at lunchtime in a third-floor, air-conditioned room. The source of the disease, whom the researchers call A1, had returned from Wuhan the day before. Eventually nine others (four members from family A, three from family B and two from family C) came down sick.
If covid-19 was truly aerosolized, tiny, virus-laden droplets could linger in the air and travel long distances. Infections could have taken place anywhere in the restaurant. Instead, the researchers found that infections traveled along the airflow from the air conditioner. This makes it more likely that larger droplets that remain in the air for a shorter time were responsible for the spread. “We conclude,” the report said, “that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation. The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow.”
What does that mean? It is a bad idea to overgeneralize from a single study. But if the virus is spread by larger droplets that travel shorter distances, it means that social distancing isn’t hopeless. Staying out of the path of those droplets is a realistic task. Better air circulation and wider distances between tables at restaurants might eventually make a positive difference when we begin returning to normal life.
A study such as this leaves me with admiration and more than a little envy. Scientific knowledge is often difficult to gather, interpret or apply. But the scientific profession at least seeks access to a shared reality. The virus is carried on the air conditioning flow or it is not. The vaccine works or it doesn’t. Scientific truth can be elusive. But the idea of objective knowledge is not itself under assault.
Medicine has a moral clarity that makes politics look ever muddier in comparison. Consider the contrast at the daily White House briefing. On those rare occasions when the scientists are given center stage, they impart useful knowledge and present their best judgments. Their goal — seeking public health — is unconflicted. They are precise, forthright, solid and reliable.
President Trump’s goal — on the days that one is discernible — is the maintenance of power. His method is to claim personal credit for anything that goes right, to blame others for anything that goes wrong, and to complain, and complain, and complain about his shockingly bad treatment at the hands of the media, his political enemies and the “deep state.” He does not argue for his view of events. He pounds his points with the oral equivalent of all-caps. And he assumes (on good evidence) that anyone who shares his side in the culture war will embrace his delusional, self-serving depiction of reality. Or that people will at least conclude that no one’s version of reality can really be trusted.
Trump unfiltered is like a badly polluted canal. The scraps of narcissism, the rotten remnants of conspiracy theories, the offal of sour grievance, the half-eaten bits of resentment flow by. They do not cohere. But they move in the same, insistent current of self, self, self.
The president wants credit for listening to health experts on social distancing when he had no other choice. He also wants to send a theatrical online wink and nod to the populist opponents of social distancing: “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA!”
Will his double game result in risky behavior and additional deaths in Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia? This seems beside the point. Trump is not making an argument. He is assuming a pose. He wants to be president and provocateur. He wants to be fireman and arsonist. He contradicts himself. He is large. He contains multitudes.
In the coronavirus crisis, the scientists are not only our best hope of solving practical problems related to treatment and testing. They are reminders of a moral universe where truth matters, where responsibility is accepted and where a commitment to the common good can be assumed. It is fast becoming a requirement of public health and national sanity: Let the scientists have the briefing stage. Alone."
"April 21, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/kim-jong-un-no-signs-that-north-korean-leader-is-in-grave-danger-south-says/2020/04/21/0a40c438-8380-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,The Washington Post,"Amid rumors of Kim Jong Un’s ‘grave’ health, Trump’s personal diplomacy with the North Korean leader appears to offer no clarity","President Trump's personal engagement with Kim Jong Un was premised on a calculation that it would help avoid the lack of clarity that plagued past bilateral talks. But after a murky report on an obscure website set off global speculation Tuesday over the North Korean leader's health, the United States appeared to be in no better position than before to assess the stability of the regime.
A day of rumors and conjecture was kick-started when Daily NK, a South Korean publication run by defectors, asserted that Kim was recovering at a mountain villa after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure last week. Though the outlet cited a single unidentified source, the report snowballed after CNN quoted a U.S. official ""with direct knowledge"" as saying that Washington was monitoring intelligence that Kim's health was in ""grave danger.""
By the time the South Korean government contradicted the bulletins by telling reporters there was no such evidence, the uncertainty had produced a round of pontificating over why Kim, an obese 36-year-old smoker, had disappeared from public view in recent days and who would be in line to succeed him.
""We're monitoring these reports very closely,"" White House national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien told Fox News, emphasizing that ""North Korea is a very closed society.""
The situation was reminiscent of past incidents in which Kim — and his father, Kim Jong Il, before him — had health scares, leaving U.S. officials in the dark. In 2014, the younger Kim disappeared from public view for several weeks, prompting rumors he might be brain dead before it emerged that he had undergone ankle surgery after he returned to public life sporting a walking cane.
Even Kim's ascension in 2011 was shrouded in mystery, as U.S. officials did not know of his father's death for two days until the regime announced it.
""I would not be surprised if U.S. intelligence or South Korean intelligence simply don't know"" about Kim's whereabouts or condition, said Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst on Korean affairs who left government in 2010.
Such a lack of clarity would further highlight the limits of Trump's unorthodox personal diplomacy with Kim, which has included three meetings over 13 months of fitful nuclear disarmament talks. Though the negotiations have gone dormant since last summer, Trump sent Kim a note in late March that included an offer to cooperate in efforts to defeat the coronavirus pandemic, according to the leader's sister, Kim Yo Jong, who is a high-ranking official in the ruling party.
North Korean officials denied Trump's assertion at a news conference this week that Kim had reciprocated with a note of his own, and the U.S. president's courtship strategy has shown signs of diminishing returns. The North has resumed short-range missile tests, including a series of projectile launches over the past month.
Some former U.S. government officials who worked on North Korean diplomacy suggested Trump's personal courtship of Kim could make it more difficult for intelligence officials to assess Kim's health and the stability of the North Korean regime.
One former Obama administration official noted that despite the leaders' relationship, the rush to forgo a working-level dialogue on the nuclear talks in favor of showy summit meetings has meant missed opportunities to establish deeper engagement throughout the two governments.
Christopher Hill, who served as the lead negotiator in the six-party talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush administration, recalled the uncertainty over Kim Jong Il's health amid U.S. and South Korean intelligence reports that he had suffered a stroke in summer 2008. The assessments were confirmed months later by a French doctor, who was flown to the country to treat him.
Hill said the Trump administration's deteriorating relationship with China could reduce potential intelligence-sharing from North Korea's closest benefactor. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday that Beijing was unaware of the source of the reports on Kim and offered no further comment.
""I don't think North Korea will tell us anything, no matter how many love letters they send,"" Hill said. ""Where we used to get stuff was from the Chinese, and I think the relationship with China has become so fraught that we don't have any kind of offline communication that helps us understand North Korea.""
Kim’s health has long been a concern given his heavy smoking habit and body weight of as much as 300 pounds, but he also has the best medical care North Korea can muster, with the ability to call on expertise from Russia or China. Information about his health is extremely hard to verify in the secretive state.
When Kim failed to show up for an important celebration to mark his late grandfather’s birthday last week, most experts assessed that he was either taking precautions because of the coronavirus pandemic or was simply breaking with precedent to show he was his own man.
Daily NK said Kim underwent surgery April 12 at a hospital in North Korea’s Myohyangsan mountain — the mountain where his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, died in 1994.
But the website said Kim left the hospital to recover at one of his many residences. It also said some doctors remained in attendance but others had already returned to Pyongyang — suggesting that there was no immediate medical emergency.
Diplomats and officials in the region said there were no signs of unusual military activity at the border between North and South Korea, and North Korean embassies around the world appeared to be operating normally.
A South Korean government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be quoted by name, said the CNN report was “not true.”
Daily NK said Kim has been suffering cardiovascular problems since August, which had been worsened by two visits to Mount Paektu, a sacred peak on North Korea’s border with China, late last year. It said Kim left Pyongyang for the hospital after presiding over a meeting of the Politburo of the ruling Workers’ Party on April 11.
Kim has not been seen in public since then.
On April 14, Pyongyang fired several short-range missiles. Kim is often shown in state media attending weapons launches, but the test was not reported in official organs. On April 15, he was not seen at unusually low-key celebrations to mark Kim Il Sung’s birthday.
The developments underscored the uncertainties inherent in North Korea’s tightly controlled regime, in which the leader’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, is increasingly emerging as a senior figure.
Experts said Kim probably does not have a succession plan. But they emphasized that Kim’s demise would not necessarily mean the regime would collapse, because he has made efforts to rebuild the institutional apparatus of the ruling party and government.
How well the Trump administration would be able to sort through a potential leadership transition, however, remains fraught.
Bruce Klingner, a former CIA deputy division chief on the Koreas, said North Korea strictly compartmentalizes information, such as keeping the details of its military’s nuclear program obscured from the Foreign Ministry.
“In the intelligence community, we referred to North Korea as the hardest of hard targets,” Klingner said. “When I took over in the Korea branch, I had been working on the Soviet Union, and the North Koreans made the Soviets look like an open book.”"
"April 21, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/hong-kong-crisis-escalates-as-china-moves-to-hasten-demise-of-citys-autonomy/2020/04/21/0a0afcd8-839c-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,The Washington Post,Hong Kong crisis escalates as China moves to hasten demise of city’s autonomy,"The constitutional crisis engulfing Hong Kong expanded significantly Tuesday as the Chinese government voiced its support for the seizure of more than a dozen pro-democracy activists and asserted Beijing’s “rights and responsibilities to maintain the constitutional order” in the city.
With the statements, the Chinese government explicitly doubled down on its position that Beijing has the power to intervene politically in Hong Kong. The move created further doubt about the credibility of the Hong Kong mini-constitution that ostensibly guarantees the city a high degree of autonomy from Chinese interference until 2047, half a century after its handover to China from British rule.
Long-standing questions about the efficacy of the autonomy provision, known as Article 22 of the Basic Law, were sharpened after Beijing’s liaison office said Friday it was not bound by the non-interference law and was legally permitted as a supervisory body to voice its criticism of legislative affairs in Hong Kong, including a filibuster by opposition lawmakers.
A day later, Hong Kong authorities arrested some of the city’s most strident anti-China voices in a coordinated and unprecedented operation, detaining figures such as former legislators Martin Lee and Albert Ho and media tycoon Jimmy Lai on grounds of leading protests last year that police did not authorize. The protests dominated world headlines.
With Hong Kong’s streets in recent months cleared of mass protests because of the coronavirus, legislators and activists in the city’s pro-democracy camp say the Communist Party and Hong Kong authorities have used the opportunity to cripple their movement through a multipronged approach while the pandemic has diverted the world’s attention.
Aside from the mass arrests and increasingly pointed declarations about China’s “supervisory” role over the city, Chinese officials in Hong Kong, including Luo Huining, the newly installed director of the central government’s liaison office, have called for improved “national security education” in Hong Kong and the passage of a national security law that would toughen law enforcement and prosecutorial powers to help prevent protests.
Chinese officials have consistently framed the massive, sometimes violent protests as an extremist uprising stoked and manipulated by the United States and directed on the ground by some of the activists arrested by Hong Kong police over the weekend.
Beijing said Tuesday that it “fully supported” the arrests of figures who had been involved in illegal assembly and “extreme violence.” In its statement, the Chinese cabinet’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office charged that U.S. support for the protesters amounted to a “political conspiracy” and a “reckless trampling of human rights and rule of law in Hong Kong.”
“The law is sacred and everyone is equal before the law,” the central government office said. “No one has extrajudicial privileges, and those who violate the law must be prosecuted in accordance with the law.”
In a separate statement, Beijing underscored its claim that it holds “supervisory” powers over Hong Kong and said the central government “must intervene” if a situation arose that harmed the country and Hong Kong.
“The Central Government grants the Special Administrative Region a high degree of autonomy, which does not mean that the Central Government does not have or surrenders its supervisory power,” the statement said. “In Hong Kong, whenever the central government exercises power in accordance with the law, there are always people who clamor: ‘The central government is intervening in Hong Kong’s autonomous affairs.’ Let us ask these people: When Jimmy Lai publicly clamored to ‘fight on behalf of the United States,’ why didn’t you come out and express your opposition?”
The Hong Kong Bar Association issued a statement Monday saying there was no provision in the Basic Law giving central Chinese authorities “supervision” over affairs that the Hong Kong government administers on its own.
Statements from Beijing and Hong Kong officials on “such a highly important legal issue have caused deep public unease,” the lawyers’ group said.
Fitch Ratings downgraded Hong Kong’s long-term debt on Monday, citing “deep-rooted sociopolitical cleavages” that threatened to tarnish the city’s reputation as a smoothly run international hub.
Beijing is “taking a more vocal role in Hong Kong affairs than at any time since the 1997 handover,” the ratings firm noted."

The Senate convened for a pro forma session at 4 p.m. Tuesday and was expected to approve the agreement by unanimous consent after up to an hour of debate. If that happens, a House vote as soon as Thursday is expected.
The deal was signed off by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy. President Donald Trump said he’d sign the measure and begin discussions on a next round of stimulus.
Trump in a series of tweets urged Congress to approve the package, adding, “After I sign this Bill, we will begin discussions on the next Legislative Initiative with fiscal relief to State/Local Governments for lost revenues” and other spending.
McConnell said he hoped the Senate would quickly act and blamed Democrats for delaying the small business aid by holding out for inclusion of money they sought for hospitals and testing.
“I welcome this bipartisan agreement and hope the Senate will quickly pass it once members have reviewed the final text. I am just sorry that it took my colleagues in Democratic leadership 12 days to accept the inevitable,” McConnell said.
Schumer touted the agreement to his members as a big win for Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team have sent members notices there will be an 11 a.m. Wednesday call to go over the emergency funding measure.
The new package would provide $320 billion to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, which was part of the $2 trillion stimulus approved late last month and ran out of money last week.
Passage would allow the government to take new applicants for the program, which provides forgivable loans to small business that keep employees on the payroll for eight weeks. The bill sets aside $30 billion of the loan funds for banks and credit unions with $10 billion to $50 billion in assets and another $30 billion for even smaller institutions.
The plan includes $60 billion in loans and grants for a separate Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, and makes farms and ranches eligible for the loans. Also, there is $75 billion for hospitals, with a significant portion aimed at those in rural areas, $25 billion for virus testing.
The testing funds include $18 billion for states, localities, territories, and tribes to conduct Covid-19 tests, $1 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $1.8 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Up to $1 billion would cover costs of testing for the uninsured.
Democrats had blocked a bill almost two weeks ago that would have added $250 billion to the small business aid plan without the extra money for other programs. Republicans hammered Democrats for the move, but Democrats argued that more hospital funds were needed amid the Covid-19 pandemic even if all previous funds hadn’t yet been spent.
Ultimately, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin decided to strike a bipartisan deal with Pelosi and Schumer by acceding to some of their demands. Democrats had also sought $150 billion for state and local governments, but Republicans rejected that proposal.
Trump said on Twitter that a further funding measure should include aid to state and local governments as well as “much needed Infrastructure Investments for Bridges, Tunnels, Broadband, Tax Incentives for Restaurants, Entertainment, Sports, and Payroll Tax Cuts to increase Economic Growth.”"
"April 21, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/21/coming-gop-plot-sabotage-biden-presidency/,The Washington Post,The coming GOP plot to sabotage a Biden presidency,"We are in the midst of the most significant national crisis most of us will ever see. By the time it’s over, Americans’ feelings about government will be transformed, as they come to understand that the question isn’t whether government should be “big” or “small” but whether it can do its job well and create security and opportunity.
Or this crisis will change very little, and a year or two from now we’ll be right back where we started, with all the weaknesses and pathologies we had before, as we find ourselves in the midst of a new conservative attack on government that succeeds in making us less secure and more unequal.
Neither one of those futures is assured. But Republicans have already seen the threat the coronavirus pandemic poses to their long-term political project and have begun working to fend it off.
Democrats, I fear, are assuming that this crisis will naturally prove them right about the role of government, and they don’t actually have to do much for their vindication to occur.
“I think it could be paradigm shifting,” former Federal Reserve chair Janet L. Yellen tells The Post’s Dan Balz, and many Democrats surely agree. Republicans are being forced to accept trillions of dollars in government spending to rescue the economy, as well as the shared assumption that it’s government’s job to make sure we don’t all get sick and die.
We’ve been here before, and not that long ago. After the 2008 election but before Barack Obama took office, Time magazine put him on its cover photoshopped as FDR, under the headline “The New New Deal.” But while he did pass a string of significant legislation utilizing government power early in his presidency — a large stimulus bill, Wall Street reform, saving the auto industry, ending bank profiteering on student loans, the Affordable Care Act — two years later Republicans took back the House and ground it all to a halt.
That is precisely what Republicans are planning to repeat, especially if Joe Biden becomes president next year.
You can see it in the “Let’s all come to the state capitol and infect each other” protests against stay-at-home orders that are attracting small crowds but huge media attention. Like a miniature version of the tea party, it’s a phenomenon of genuine sentiment that is shaped and organized by right-wing elites, promoted relentlessly by Fox News, and in this case, validated by President Trump himself.
It may not be much yet, but this is just beginning. You can bet that Republicans will be holding strategy meetings and fielding polls and writing reports to determine not just how to stop Americans from becoming more open to expansive government action, but how to turn this crisis into anger at government itself — assuming Biden becomes president in January.
They may have added a couple of trillion dollars in debt to finance tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, and are now going along with trillions more in spending to rescue the economy. But if you think that will lessen their willingness to cry that deficits are a mortal danger to America and demand the evisceration of the safety net once a Democrat is in the White House, you know nothing about the GOP.
Right now it’s Democrats who want to do the most to rescue the economy, even though a quick recovery represents Trump’s only hope of winning reelection. Republicans are fighting every step of the way to make the rescue packages as small as possible; they may be worried that if we do too much and Trump loses anyway, Biden could be left with an economy getting back on its feet and a population that remembers how the government gave them generous unemployment benefits and a stimulus check or two.
Which is why Republicans will deploy a strategy that includes both sabotaging the economy by demanding brutal austerity policies and a sweeping anti-government PR effort. The latter will feature promoting a tea party II with angry protests that are catnip to the media; fake scandal-mongering to portray the Biden administration as corrupt (Solyndra! Fast and Furious!); and every effort they can devise to throw sand in the government’s gears to make it difficult for the administration to actually solve today’s problems, let alone prepare for tomorrow’s.
If it all goes well, the success of that effort, combined with what has become the nearly inevitable swing of the political pendulum, will allow them to take back Congress in 2022 just as they took the House in 2010.
Which is why Democrats also need to begin planning now — not once the crisis is behind us, not once the election is over, but now — for how they’re going to defeat that Republican effort. They need to devise policy plans for Biden’s first year in office that not only help the country but are hard for Republicans to reverse, such as creating automatic stabilizers to make economic sabotage more difficult.
And they need to mount a rhetorical assault not just on Trump but on small-government philosophy itself. It would be a terrible mistake to assume that the public will naturally come to realize that it’s foolish to leave the country without a strong safety net and a public health infrastructure ready to respond to a pandemic.
You have to tell them, over and over again: America’s response to this pandemic was so awful not just because Trump is incompetent, but because conservative you’re-all-on-your-own philosophy was put into practice in ways that left us all vulnerable. In so many ways what we’re suffering through now, both in public health and economically, is a failure of conservatism.
Republicans know that the public might arrive at that conclusion — and they’re working to make sure it doesn’t happen. Democrats need to work just as hard to make sure it does."

The Senate has scheduled a late afternoon session Tuesday in anticipation of approving an agreement on a nearly $500 billion stimulus bill, including $310 billion to replenish the small business program. But negotiations with the Trump administration ended early Tuesday without a deal being reached.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement to representatives released shortly afterward that a House vote could occur “as early as Thursday.”

“Republicans have been trying to secure more funding for this critical program for a week and a half,” Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Monday. “Colleagues, it’s past time, past time, to get this done for the country.”
‘Fine Print’
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on CNN Monday night that there was an agreement on the principles of the aid package and that negotiations were “down to the fine print.”
The basic outline of the plan was announced Sunday after Democrats secured additional funds: $50 billion to $60 billion for a separate Economic Injury Disaster Loan program; $75 billion for hospitals, with a significant portion aimed at those in rural areas; and $25 billion for virus testing.
Democrats had blocked a bill almost two weeks ago that would have added $250 billion to the small business aid plan without the extra money for other programs. Republicans hammered Democrats for the move, but Democrats argued that more hospital funds were needed amid the Covid-19 pandemic even if all previous funds hadn’t yet been spent.
Ultimately, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin decided to strike a bipartisan deal with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer by acceding to some of their demands. Democrats had also sought $150 billion for state and local governments, but Republicans rejected that proposal.
President Donald Trump expressed optimism about chances for a deal at a White House briefing Monday.
“We hope to have an agreement very soon, and hopefully tomorrow the Senate is going to be able to vote,” the president said.
Some details have proven difficult to resolve. Both sides haggled on Monday over how to distribute aid to hospitals and testing sites. Another disagreement was over which agency should oversee the testing program, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Institutes of Health, according to one person familiar with the discussions.
The proposed legislation would set aside $60 billion for smaller banks after the original program was criticized for favoring larger firms that already had access to capital. Intense lobbying was underway to influence the access rules for the program.
Hoyer told members they should be prepared to travel to Washington for a roll-call vote on the bill. Attempts to pass the bill by unanimous consent -- which would let most members stay home -- are expected to be blocked by members such as Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, who has called such a procedure undemocratic.
House Democratic leaders also face a possible rebellion from their most liberal members who want to attach other changes, including more cash payments for individuals and cancellation of mortgage and rental debt.
“I am not here for a $5 bill and I will not insult my community with that,” said New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who called for recurring payments of $2,000 per month for low and middle-income individuals for the extent of the coronavirus crisis.
Opened on April 3 after being approved in last month’s $2 trillion stimulus, the Paycheck Protection Program has provided money to 1.6 million companies through almost 5,000 lenders, according to the Small Business Administration."

Here’s How That Happened,"April 20, 2020 will go down in oil-market history as the day when the U.S. benchmark price for crude dropped below zero for the first time -- and then kept falling. In a massive and unprecedented swing, the future contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate tumbled to minus $37.63 a barrel. The jaw-dropping development was in no small measure down to an extreme glitch in the way oil futures operate. But it also revealed a fundamental truth about the oil market in the age of coronavirus and the aftermath of a price war: The world’s most important commodity is quickly losing all value as chronic oversupply overwhelms the world’s crude tanks, pipelines and supertankers.
1. Why would anyone pay to sell their oil?
For some producers, it may be cheaper in the long run than closing down production or finding a place to store the supply bubbling out of the ground. Many worry that shutting their wells might damage them permanently, rendering them uneconomical in the future. Then there are the traders who buy oil futures contracts as a way of betting on price movements who have no intention of taking delivery of barrels. They can get caught by sharp price drops and face the choice of finding storage or selling at a loss. And the escalating glut of oil has made storage space scarce, and increasingly expensive.
2. Where did the glut come from?
Either the pandemic or the price war alone would have rocked energy markets. Together, they have turned them upside down. As the virus started to spread around the globe, it began eating away at oil demand. But just as countries like Italy showed what kind of damage a national lockdown could do economically, Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world’s biggest oil producers, escalated the price war. A pact that had restrained production collapsed and both countries opened their taps to the fullest, releasing record volumes of crude into the market.
3. Wasn’t there a deal on that?
Yes, one worked out by OPEC, Russia, the U.S. and the Group of 20 countries. But its call for an overall production cut of roughly 10% proved to be too little, too late. Prices initially turned negative just in obscure corners of the U.S. market such as Wyoming, where storage options are few. Then major hubs began to register negative prices for small streams of selected crudes. And on April 20, prices fell sharply below zero on the NYMEX exchange, which is owned by CME, the world’s largest energy market.
4. What did futures contracts have to do with that?
The lowest prices came in trades in futures -- contracts in which a buyer locks in a purchase at a stated price at a stated time. Futures are a tool for users of oil to hedge against price swings, but also a means of speculation. The contracts run for a set period, and traders who don’t want to unwind their position or take delivery generally roll over their monthly contracts shortly before expiration to a month further in the future. Contracts for May delivery were due to expire on April 21, putting maximum pressure the day before on traders whose contracts were coming due. For them, selling at a steeply negative price was better than taking delivery of actual oil because nobody needs it and there are fewer and fewer places to put it.
5. What happened to other oil prices?
Brent futures, the benchmark for Europe in London, ended April 20 down sharply but still above $25 a barrel. The physical domestic crude market in the U.S. saw negative trades for grades like WTI in Midland, Mars Blend, Light and Heavy Louisiana Sweet crudes. Horrified by negative benchmark prices, some U.S. oil producers began offering crude at fixed prices for the first time since an oil rout in 2014-15. The WTI futures contract for June delivery changed hands at $20 a barrel on April 20 before falling further the next day -- highlighting the extent to which the rout was being caused by the massive glut in the market rather than just a technical quirk. Ever tightening constraints on storage capacity mean the June contract may also turn negative, according to one of the top trading houses.
6. What’s happening to storage?
Since the glut began to build and prices began to fall, storage facilities have been moving toward capacity. Crude stockpiles at Cushing in Oklahoma -- America’s key storage hub and delivery point of the WTI contract -- have jumped 48% to almost 55 million barrels since the end of February. The hub had working storage capacity of 76 million as of Sept. 30, according to the Energy Information Administration. The industry has been accumulating supply aboard ships, while contemplating other creative options such as storing oil in rail tanker cars. The Trump Administration, which is concerned about the possible ripple effect from oil bankruptcies, is eyeing a proposal, which is still in its infancy, to pay drillers to keep their oil in the ground temporarily. The idea would be to keep it off the market until prices recovered, giving the Treasury a healthy profit eventually while protecting producers from immediate losses.
7. What does this mean for consumers?
Nationwide, the average gasoline price is down more than $1 a gallon in the past year to $1.81. It’s fallen every day since late February. It’ll take a couple more weeks for the declines in futures prices to be reflected at the pump. And with taxes making up part of the price, there’s only so low they can go."

The Senate convened for a pro forma session at 4 p.m. Tuesday and was expected to approve the agreement by unanimous consent after up to an hour of debate. If that happens, a House vote as soon as Thursday is expected.
The deal was signed off by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy. President Donald Trump said he’d sign the measure and begin discussions on a next round of stimulus.
Trump in a series of tweets urged Congress to approve the package, adding, “After I sign this Bill, we will begin discussions on the next Legislative Initiative with fiscal relief to State/Local Governments for lost revenues” and other spending.
McConnell said he hoped the Senate would quickly act and blamed Democrats for delaying the small business aid by holding out for inclusion of money they sought for hospitals and testing.
“I welcome this bipartisan agreement and hope the Senate will quickly pass it once members have reviewed the final text. I am just sorry that it took my colleagues in Democratic leadership 12 days to accept the inevitable,” McConnell said.
Schumer touted the agreement to his members as a big win for Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team have sent members notices there will be an 11 a.m. Wednesday call to go over the emergency funding measure.
The new package would provide $320 billion to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, which was part of the $2 trillion stimulus approved late last month and ran out of money last week.
Passage would allow the government to take new applicants for the program, which provides forgivable loans to small business that keep employees on the payroll for eight weeks. The bill sets aside $30 billion of the loan funds for banks and credit unions with $10 billion to $50 billion in assets and another $30 billion for even smaller institutions.
The plan includes $60 billion in loans and grants for a separate Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, and makes farms and ranches eligible for the loans. Also, there is $75 billion for hospitals, with a significant portion aimed at those in rural areas, $25 billion for virus testing.
The testing funds include $18 billion for states, localities, territories, and tribes to conduct Covid-19 tests, $1 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $1.8 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Up to $1 billion would cover costs of testing for the uninsured.
Democrats had blocked a bill almost two weeks ago that would have added $250 billion to the small business aid plan without the extra money for other programs. Republicans hammered Democrats for the move, but Democrats argued that more hospital funds were needed amid the Covid-19 pandemic even if all previous funds hadn’t yet been spent.
Ultimately, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin decided to strike a bipartisan deal with Pelosi and Schumer by acceding to some of their demands. Democrats had also sought $150 billion for state and local governments, but Republicans rejected that proposal.
Trump said on Twitter that a further funding measure should include aid to state and local governments as well as “much needed Infrastructure Investments for Bridges, Tunnels, Broadband, Tax Incentives for Restaurants, Entertainment, Sports, and Payroll Tax Cuts to increase Economic Growth.”"

The U.S. ignored the warnings.,"“CAME OUT of nowhere,” President Trump said March 6 of the coronavirus pandemic. “I just think this is something . . . that you can never really think is going to happen.” A few weeks later, he added, “I would view it as something that just surprised the whole world.” Mr. Trump also said, “Nobody knew there would be a pandemic or epidemic of this proportion.”
Of course, no one can pinpoint the exact moment that lightning will strike. But a global pandemic? Experts have predicted it, warned about the preparedness gaps and urged action. Again and again and again.
Just look at 2019. In January, the U.S. intelligence community issued its annual global threat assessment. It declared, “We assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support. . . . The growing proximity of humans and animals has increased the risk of disease transmission. The number of outbreaks has increased in part because pathogens originally found in animals have spread to human populations.”
In September, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security issued a report titled “Preparedness for a High-Impact Respiratory Pathogen Pandemic.” The report found that if such a pathogen emerged, “it would likely have significant public health, economic, social, and political consequences. . . . The combined possibilities of short incubation periods and asymptomatic spread can result in very small windows for interrupting transmission, making such an outbreak difficult to contain.” The report pointed to “large national and international readiness gaps.”
In October, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, working with the Johns Hopkins center and the Economist Intelligence Unit, published its latest Global Health Security Index, examining open-source information about the state of health security across 195 nations, and scoring them. The report warned, “No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics, and every country has important gaps to address.” The report found that “Fewer than 5 percent of countries scored in the highest tier for their ability to rapidly respond to and mitigate the spread of an epidemic.”
In November, the Center for Strategic and International Studies published a study by its Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security. It warned, “The American people are far from safe. To the contrary, the United States remains woefully ill-prepared to respond to global health security threats. This kind of vulnerability should not be acceptable to anyone. At the extreme, it is a matter of life and death. . . . Outbreaks proliferate that can spread swiftly across the globe and become pandemics, disrupting supply chains, trade, transport, and ultimately entire societies and economies.” The report recommended: “Restore health security leadership at the White House National Security Council.”
Came out of nowhere? Not even close. The question that must be addressed in future postmortems is why all this expertise and warning was ignored."
"April 22, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/21/if-biden-is-serious-about-winning-he-should-pick-tammy-baldwin-his-running-mate/,The Washington Post,"If Biden is serious about winning, he should pick Tammy Baldwin as his running mate","In presidential elections, winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden can spend all day in his basement designing a fantasy platform, imagining his ideal Cabinet and drafting soaring speeches to heal our political divides — but it’ll all be for nothing if he fails to get 270 electoral votes.
That makes Biden’s equation for picking a running mate simple: He needs a qualified candidate who can help him win a key swing state such as Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. Every other consideration — age, ideological fit, working relationship — should take a back seat to this straightforward election math. And according to those numbers, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin is the right, and arguably the only, choice.
Baldwin is obviously qualified: She’s been in the Senate since 2013 and was in the House for 14 years before that. She’d make history as the fourth woman — and the first out lesbian — on a presidential ticket for a major party. And, as a progressive, she’d bring ideological balance to the ticket.
But most important, she’s from Wisconsin: the state that gave Trump his 270th electoral vote in 2016. If Baldwin brought Biden a mere two points in Wisconsin, that would be a huge help.
And Biden doesn’t have any other options like Baldwin in the swing states.
In Florida, both senators and the governor are Republicans, and Biden probably should stick to politicians who have shown they can win a marquee statewide race. Biden has also pledged to pick a woman as his vice president, so Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Pennsylvania Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. are out.
Biden has two options in Michigan — Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — but neither would be a stronger addition to the ticket than Baldwin. Stabenow doesn’t look like a good bet right now: She underperformed expectations in 2018, when she beat Republican challenger John James by only 6.5 points, while Baldwin won her latest race by double digits. Whitmer is a gamble, too. By the end of the novel coronavirus crisis, she could be wildly popular or completely toxic in her home state, depending on how the Trump-stoked protests against her social distancing orders play out.
There’s also Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who would make history as the first openly bisexual candidate, and might even be to the right of Biden. But Baldwin has more Senate experience than Sinema, and Wisconsin is still a touch more purple than Arizona.
Baldwin is simply head and shoulders above the other contenders. She’d give Biden a boost where he needs it, and she would avoid the pitfalls of similar candidates, though she has some weaknesses, too.
Baldwin hasn’t run for president, so she doesn’t have as much experience in the national spotlight as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar or California Sen. Kamala D. Harris. And if she left her Senate seat, Republicans would have the chance to take it in a special election, complicating Biden’s path to passing legislation.
But neither of those problems is a dealbreaker. Vice-presidential candidates don’t need to be electrifying campaigners for the ticket to win — just ask vice presidents Mike Pence and Al Gore. And Baldwin may be a sympathetic figure on a debate stage next to Pence, who is very conservative on LGBT issues. While Democrats should be concerned about losing Baldwin’s seat, if Biden believes that Baldwin is the best choice for vice president, he should pick her and sort out the down-ballot consequences later.
Biden has a huge responsibility in this election. If Trump wins a second term, Americans will understandably start to see him as the new normal. Attacks on the press, Twitter outbursts, constant lying, authoritarian saber-rattling, complete incompetence, disregard for expertise — all these features of Trumpism will be permanent parts of our politics. Biden has a chance to make Trump a historical aberration. If he’s serious about taking that chance, he’ll make smart moves such as picking Baldwin as his running mate."

They’re just bringing their love affair with luxury brands home. 
A surge in China sales for stores operated by the likes of LVMH and Hermes International has spurred optimism that consumer demand will snap back as the lockdowns lift. The reports offered a glimmer of light amid data showing that China’s retail sales plunged 15.8% in March from a year earlier.
Unfortunately, it looks as though Chinese consumers are simply buying their alligator handbags and diamond watches at home instead of in Hong Kong, Paris or Milan. While travel restrictions aimed at halting the pandemic are partly responsible, the trend was already in place before the virus appeared — driven by a change in tax rates.
Beijing has been encouraging the nation’s shoppers, who accounted for around a third of global luxury sales last year, to spend more money at home. The gap between prices of upscale goods onshore and overseas shrank to 15% last year from about 30% three years ago after a series of cuts to China’s luxury sales taxes. Protests last year in Hong Kong, a favorite pit-stop for buyers of high-end products, also helped to spur domestic sales. The migration still has a long way to run: Only 30% of China’s luxury purchases took place at home last year.
All this suggests that this spurt in luxury sales is unlikely to be sustained at these levels. Chinese purchases won’t rescue the sector globally, as my colleague Andrea Felsted has noted. More than 90% of sales take place in bricks-and-mortar stores. That’s understandable: If you’re going to spend thousands of dollars on a handcrafted item, you’ll want to touch it, rather than just clicking a button on an e-commerce site. 
Besides, Chinese shoppers are still worried about their jobs and the prospect of salary cuts. Most people don’t plan to increase spending on high-end goods, according to a Morgan Stanley survey that suggests the uptick reported by LVMH, Hermes and L’Oreal SA may quickly fade. Of 2,000 consumers surveyed, 29% said they will spend less on luxury goods next month versus this month, while 40% said they would spend more on groceries. The survey covered city-dwellers aged 18 to 49 in 19 provinces.
The luxury sales bounce will taper off into a gradual though sustainable rise, according to Lucia Li, a Beijing-based partner at Bain & Co. The consultancy divided Chinese consumer products into six categories ranked from those that will gain a permanent boost from the coronavirus, such as digital healthcare, to those that will face enduring headwinds such as traditional retailers. It placed luxury goods in the middle bracket, along with alcohol and household appliances."
"April 22, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/21/even-republicans-intelligence-committee-admit-putin-helped-trump-get-elected/,The Washington Post,Even Republicans on the Intelligence Committee admit that Putin helped Trump get elected,"Something unusual happened in Congress on Tuesday. Republicans in the Senate found within themselves the strength required to acknowledge reality:
The Senate Intelligence Committee has unanimously endorsed the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia conducted a sweeping and unprecedented campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
The heavily-redacted report, based on a three-year investigation, builds on a committee finding nearly two years ago that the January 2017 intelligence community assessment (ICA) on Russia was sound. The spy agencies also found that Russia sought to shake faith in American democracy, denigrate then-candidate Hillary Clinton and boost her rival Donald Trump.
The report, while not unexpected, is nonetheless a milestone — the first extensive bipartisan congressional affirmation of the intelligence agencies’ conclusion, which continues to be at odds with President Trump’s oft-stated doubts about Russia’s role in the 2016 race.
As of this writing, President Trump has not yet tweeted angrily that the committee’s eight Republicans are Trump-hating, fake-news hoaxers, but he may have been distracted tweeting meaningless poll numbers to prove how universally beloved he is; give him some time.
It’s striking that even fervent Trump allies such as Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) were willing to sign on to a report that validates the clear conclusion of every serious person and agency that has examined the 2016 election. Whatever your view of the degree to which Trump himself and his campaign acted to help Russian leader Vladimir Putin in his attack on our system, the fact that the attack took place is beyond dispute.
Unless you’re Trump himself, or one of his more enthusiastic sycophants. Attorney General William P. Barr is still undertaking an investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, with the obvious hope of validating Trump’s position that the whole thing should never have happened, and that when the FBI received information indicating that Russia was attempting to manipulate an American presidential election, their response should have been, “Eh, there’s no need to look into it.”
But the report is clear: Putin “approved and directed aspects of this influence campaign,” which “sought to denigrate then-candidate [Hillary] Clinton.” Furthermore, “Putin and the Russian Government demonstrated a preference for candidate Trump.”
Even if you accept that there was no real criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, Trump’s campaign operatives certainly tried, but in a bumbling, haphazard way. There were dozens of contacts, including the famous Trump Tower meeting that Donald Trump Jr. set up after being promised dirt on Clinton from someone he was told was representing the Russian government.
What there is not is so much as a scintilla of evidence that anyone in the campaign ever said, “Whoa, we can’t get help from Russia, or any other foreign government for that matter. We need to call the FBI.”
Trump certainly wouldn’t have wanted to do that. When asked later what he would do if Russia or another foreign government sought to help him in 2020, he mocked the very idea of alerting the authorities. “Oh, let me call the FBI,"" Trump scoffed. ""Give me a break — life doesn’t work that way.” Not for some people, anyway.
But as the Intelligence Committee wrote, Putin sought “to sow discord, undermine democratic institutions, and interfere in U.S. elections.” If those were Putin’s motivations, it has to be considered one of the most spectacular successes in the history of covert intelligence operations.
For a relatively modest investment of time and money, Putin created more discord than he could have dreamed of. And what in U.S. history has undermined our democracy more than the person who sits right now in the Oval Office?
Trump has all but obliterated the United States’ standing in the world, subverted the Western alliance in every way he can think of, taken a sledgehammer to one democratic institution after another, and disastrously bungled the response to a pandemic for good measure.
Not only that, Trump was so unapologetic in his corruption that as soon as the special counsel’s investigation into the Russia scandal ended, he got on the phone with the president of Ukraine and tried to strong-arm him into helping Trump’s reelection. You may remember that episode; he got impeached for it.
I suspect Trump will be only slightly bothered by the Intelligence Committee’s report. He won’t like the fact that those eight Republicans acknowledge Putin’s desire to get him elected, something Trump himself spent so much time denying. But, on the other hand, those same senators also all voted to acquit him in the impeachment trial. They’re in his pocket, and he knows it.
We still don’t know what Putin is planning for our fall campaign, but if history is a guide — and if more chaos is what he’s after — he’ll be coming to Trump’s aid once again. Trump, increasingly desperate as he stares down the possibility of defeat, will be only too welcoming of that help. And maybe in a few years there will be another Intelligence Committee report in which even Republicans admit what happened."

We think the warnings are, for the most part, fair. Meanwhile, though, the Trump administration and its conservative allies are using the pandemic as cover to advance long-standing policy goals and launch new fronts in the nation’s culture wars. By intensifying efforts at deregulation and broadening restrictions on abortion and immigration, the White House and Republicans in GOP-dominated states are waging the war against covid-19 as a continuation of politics by other means.
Along those lines, the president’s Monday night Twitter blast, announcing his intent to shut down all immigration, is long on election-year bombast but short on details of potential practical effect. It’s no secret that Mr. Trump regards virtually all forms of immigration, legal and illegal, with contempt. He has mounted repeated assaults on the traditional means by which foreigners reach this country and achieve residency and citizenship.
By saying he would sign an executive order to “temporarily suspend immigration,” and by announcing Tuesday that the suspension would last 60 days, the president, predictably, grabbed headlines. But how much can that mean when Mr. Trump has already effectively closed the borders with Canada and Mexico, including to asylum seekers; banned European and Chinese visitors from entering the country; strangled the decades-old refugee program; expanded an existing travel ban to include Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country; shut down visa-granting U.S. consular offices around the world; persuaded the Supreme Court to uphold his prohibition on immigrants who might need public assistance; and pursued litigation that would empower the administration to deport hundreds of thousands of “dreamers,” reared and educated in this country after being brought here as children?
The ostensible public health rationale for further sealing the nation off from the rest of the world — potentially by shutting down immigrant visas for foreigners who would enter the United States to work or join relatives — is thin, given that the novel coronavirus has already permeated every state and most cities and counties. So is Mr. Trump’s other stated justification — to protect American jobs. In the course of U.S. history, immigration continued through major crises, albeit at lower levels, including the Great Depression and World War II, during which more than 100,000 members of the armed forces became naturalized citizens. And in ensuing years, the economy flourished.
In fact, Mr. Trump’s announcement, whatever the forthcoming particulars, is of a piece with his recent moves during the pandemic to pursue unrelated priorities in his agenda — for instance, slashing emission levels for commercial vehicles, among other rollbacks of Obama-era environmental measures. Similarly, Republicans in Texas, Louisiana and elsewhere have cited the pandemic as a pretext for banning abortions, speciously lumping them together with other “elective” surgical procedures.
Democrats have used similar tactics in a few cases, for example by pushing a $15 minimum wage and strict limits on executive pay as conditions for helping rescue companies reeling from the economy’s partial shutdown.
In many instances, the veneer of relevance to combating the pandemic looks more like a smokescreen to pursue pet agendas. It’s a sad day when a mortal threat to public health is seized on as just another weapon in a war of partisan attrition."
"April 22, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/aid-bill-expected-to-pass-this-week-wont-include-700-million-sought-by-dc-city-says/2020/04/21/f28ac89a-83d7-11ea-ae26-989cfce1c7c7_story.html,The Washington Post,Aid bill expected to pass this week doesn’t include $700 million sought by D.C.,"The coronavirus bailout deal struck by the White House and congressional leaders Tuesday does not grant the District’s request for an additional $700᠆million, despite pleas from local leaders that the nation’s capital was shortchanged in the first round of relief funds.
Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and others say they will keep asking for future legislation to include the money, which would have been allocated in an earlier bill if the federal government had defined the nation’s capital as a state rather than a territory.
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the city’s nonvoting representative in the House, says more than half of Democrats in Congress have supported the District’s push for the funding. But it was difficult to add the aid to a bill that is focused on small businesses, hospitals and testing and contains no funding for states and localities.
“That significantly reduces our chances to get something in there for one city, even one that has, forgive my expression, been screwed,” Norton said in an interview.
The Senate approved the new aid bill Tuesday. The House is expected to vote Thursday.
In an interview with WTOP, Bowser (D) said she’s been “assured that Congress wants to get this done” and that the city “will continue to push.”
Federal relief legislation passed in March guaranteed at least $1.25 billion to each of the 50 states but required the District to split a smaller pool of funding with five U.S. territories. The city received $500 million.
That prompted outrage because the District is almost always treated as a state when it comes to highway, education and food assistance funding. Unlike territories, the District pays federal taxes — more, taxes, in fact, than several less populous states. The city also has more covid-19 cases than many states.
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) was among those championing more money for the District. On Monday, according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, Hoyer urged former congressman Mark Meadows, now the president’s chief of staff, to support retroactively funding the District like a state.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who frequently represents the District’s interests in the Senate, said last month that Republicans deliberately targeted the nation’s capital for lower funding. The bill ultimately passed unanimously.
“Despite an increase in covid-19 cases in Washington, D.C., Republicans are still playing a cynical political game by refusing to provide the people in our nation’s capital with their fair allocation of emergency federal relief funds,” Van Hollen said in a Tuesday statement. “We will keep fighting until this injustice is addressed.”
Michael Zona, a spokesman for Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said last month that the District received less money because it is not a state. “No one was trying to ‘shortchange’ any particular jurisdiction,” Zona said.
D.C. officials say failing to fully fund the District also affects residents of neighboring Maryland and Virginia — as well as members of Congress and their staff members who live in the city.
President Trump addressed the disparity when asked at a news conference last week. “We’re looking at that, certainly,” the president said. “I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we’ve done.”
Bowser, who had previously called the treatment of the District “infuriating,” responded to his comments by praising the federal government for providing “critical equipment” and urging the administration and Congress to address the “injustice” of the funding disparity.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said additional funding for the District would be among her top priorities for the next round of emergency relief.
The D.C. Council passed legislation Tuesday that would require landlords to inform tenants when they receive mortgage deferrals that, under previously passed legislation, makes tenants eligible for lower rent. Lawmakers also authorized nightclubs to sell food and alcohol for off-premise consumption."
"April 23, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/22/markets-oil-coronavirus/,The Washington Post,"U.S. stocks rebound as oil prices stabilize, states move to loosen lockdowns","Global markets rebounded Wednesday after a wild, two-day drop in the price of oil unnerved investors and sent major indexes due south.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 457 points, or roughly 2 percent, to finish at 23,475.82. The blue-chip index had clawed back some of the 1,000 points it gave up the first two days of the week with help from such technology stalwarts as Apple, Intel and Microsoft, and surprising gains from oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil.
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed up 63 points, or 2.3 percent, to 2,799.31. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished up 232 points, or 2.8 percent, to 8,495.38. All 11 U.S. stock market sectors were positive, led by energy, technology and utilities. Nearly all 30 Dow blue chips gained.
European markets surged across the board, as did most of Asia’s.
West Texas intermediate crude oil, which sold for less than $0 a barrel earlier in the week, hovered above $14 on Wednesday on its June contract, a 22.7 percent gain. Global benchmark Brent crude, which briefly dipped to a 21-year low early Wednesday, advanced 8.4 percent, to $20.96 a barrel. The improvement remains a fraction of the $50 or so needed for a producer to make money.
The market surge is partly a response to states such as Georgia and Florida announcing plans to reopen their economies in the coming days. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is beginning to outline the early stages of how New York, the state hit hardest by the virus, will start to loosen restrictions.
“Oil prices dropped to 20-year lows because 3.6 billion people, more than half of the world’s population, are covered by lockdowns,” said analyst Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. “When we see milestones like economies beginning to open up, lockdowns being loosened or lifted altogether, that means those 3.6 billion people are starting to go back to work, back to school, and there will be more cars on the road and more planes in the air with actual passengers. That means oil demand will begin to normalize.”
Widespread lockdowns — seen as crucial to containing a pandemic that has killed more than 47,000 people in the United States and 180,000 worldwide — have sent the economy into a tailspin. With business and social activity largely in hibernation, more than 22 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past four weeks. The federal government has unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus spending trying to get the country back on track.
Wednesday’s recovery in oil prices came on the heels of an Energy Department report that said U.S. oil production last week fell by 900,000 barrels a day, to 12.2 million. A month ago, the U.S. produced a record 13.1 million barrels a day.
“The falling rig count and collapse in prices are having its intended effect,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital. “It’s forcing oil operators to shut in their wells due to low prices. It’s beginning to clean out the glut in oil supply and restore the balance with demand.”
The oversupply has strained capacity. Giant oil tankers have become floating storage tanks, plying oceans with millions of barrels while they search for a place to unload the commodity. The U.S. fracking industry has been particularly hard hit by the sharp drop in prices, which is threatening to send many debt-laden operators into bankruptcy.
Share prices of such large oil companies as ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP rose Wednesday because the firms’ relatively strong financial position makes them more likely to weather an extended slowdown in consumption.
President Trump tweeted Tuesday that he would “never let the great U.S. Oil & Gas Industry down,” adding that he instructed Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to make funds available for the struggling sector.
But analysts were skeptical of how much help the Trump administration could offer. When oil sells at $0 or below — and it went as low as negative $30 over the two days — that means producers have so many barrels stockpiled, they’re paying consumers to take it off their hands. It’s an ominous sign for the economic recovery, analysts say.
“The supply-and-demand balance for oil is so out of whack that global demand cannot grow fast enough and suppliers can’t cut supply quickly enough to put things back in order,” said Frank Verrastro of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There is so much oil sloshing around the world and so few people using it that there is no remedy. Even President’s Trump toolbox looks bare. ”
The oil crisis emerged as U.S. companies already are dealing with one of the most challenging environments in their histories. Companies have begun a critical earnings season that will test how they are weathering the public health lockdown and what their outlook is for the remainder of the year.
Meanwhile in Washington, the Senate passed a $484 billion relief package to replenish a small-business loan program that’s been overrun by demand and to devote more money to hospitals and coronavirus testing. The House could pass the bill as soon as Thursday.
Global exchanges also advanced Wednesday. The German DAX gained about 1.6 percent and London’s FTSE climbed 2.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was flat most of the day but lost 0.7 percent at the day’s close. The HSI in Hong Kong did the opposite, riding gains for most of the day, only to give back all but 0.4 percent just before the close of business. India’s BSE Sensex was the big gainer, up 2.4 percent."

The firms can’t tap Paycheck Protection Program loans disbursed by the Small Business Administration because a decades-old regulation bars the agency from subsidizing political speech, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth said in a decision late Tuesday in Washington.
The loan program created under the $2.2 trillion CARES Act caps interest at 1%, waives several borrower standards and allows for possible forgiveness as great as the loan’s full principal depending on the company’s payroll costs and other factors, the judge said. Claiming that such an offer is a loan rather than a subsidy “is a distinction without a difference,” according to the ruling.
“There is no doubt that PPP loans confer a financial benefit not otherwise available to businesses in the open market,” the judge said. “This is, of course, the point of an economic stimulus -- to prop up the economy while the private sector struggles to provide gainful employment to Americans seeking work.”
The American Association of Political Consultants said it would appeal.
“Most of our member firms are small businesses, with a majority having fewer than 10 employees,” President Rose Kapolczynski said in a statement, adding that the economic crisis will weigh especially on those that depend heavily on personal contact, such as signature gathering and event organizing.
“Our members are excluded solely because they help clients exercise their First Amendment rights,” she said.

The Congressional Budget Office said last week that the mammoth economic relief package passed in March would cost the government $1.8 trillion, not the $2.2 trillion initially thought.
But look beneath the surface, some economists say, and the CBO’s calculations are not that comforting. Why? Because they suggest the government may not be providing the economy with all the support it might need to survive the coronavirus shock relatively intact.
“From a budget perspective, this might seem like good news, but from the larger issue of avoiding economic catastrophe it is a problem,” said former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who now heads the American Action Forum.
The difference between the CBO’s calculations and the early estimates comes down to a judgment about the Federal Reserve’s financing facilities for companies and state and local governments. Based partly on information from the Fed board, the CBO reckons that the loan programs backed by the relief package won’t add to the budget deficit.
Worse Shape
That may not be as good a result as it sounds. The Fed can avoid making losses on its facilities and increasing the deficit by discouraging participation by riskier borrowers. But that leaves those companies in worse shape, posing a danger to the economy as a whole.
“There’s a concern about losing money that I frankly don’t understand,” former chief White House economist Glenn Hubbard said. “The way not to lose money is to not make any loans or to lend money to people who don’t need it.”
“Those are great strategies but they don’t seem to work in a crisis,” added Hubbard, now at the Columbia Business School.
The gist of the critics’ argument is this: It’s better in an economic emergency such as this to err on the side of taking losses rather than forgo helping borrowers in dire straits through no fault of their own.
Worth the Cost
If that increases the budget deficit because not all of the loans are repaid, so be it. It’s worth the cost to try to make sure the economy comes through the crisis without incurring significant long-term damage.
The central bank is setting up the financing facilities under Section 13-3 of the Federal Reserve Act that allows it to establish emergency lending programs in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” The Fed is prohibited from taking losses on the facilities and so needs money from the Treasury Department to absorb any red ink that might occur from loans going bad.
The Fed and Treasury face a dilemma. They realize that many companies will need help to survive what will be the deepest recession since the Great Depression. But they don’t want to lend to borrowers that have scant chance of being able to repay. That would expose them to attacks that they were just wasting taxpayers’ money.
If the Fed set up a program that was likely to result in losses, “it would be seen as violating its governing law and as such would open itself up to all sorts of political criticism,” said former Fed official Roberto Perli, now a partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC.
Main Street
Congress set aside $454 billion in the CARES Act as a backstop for Fed financing facilities. The central bank has so far outlined plans to deploy some $185 billion of that, including $75 billion to absorb losses on a planned $600 billion Main Street Lending Program.
The Main Street name is a bit of a misnomer. While money is available to companies with up to 10,000 employees, the program seems pitched to middle-sized companies, not small businesses. The minimum eligible loan is $1 million.
Banks are pressing for a lower threshold.
“The minimum loan amount should be no higher than $100,000,” the Independent Community Bankers of America wrote in an April 16 letter to the Fed. “Otherwise, Main Street businesses and community banks will not participate.”
Profit Margins
As presently constituted, it’s assumed that more than 85% of the funding the facility provides will be repaid in full. Ex Fed official Joseph Gagnon suggested it could be more generous -- say 70% -- but then the Treasury would have to kick in more money.
Regardless, many medium sized companies operate on such thin profit margins that they need grants, not loans, said Gagnon, now at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. But Congress did not provide for that – unlike what it effectively did for small businesses.
The Fed has indicated it is open to altering the terms of the yet-to-be-launched program in response to feedback.
The central bank is supporting small businesses through a liquidity facility that went into operation last week. Under that facility, the Fed provides term financing to banks against loans issued under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program. It’s not exposed to any credit losses because the loans are guaranteed by the government.
In calculating that the government won’t lose money on Fed programs backstopped by the CARES Act, the CBO estimated that the new lending will expose the government to default and other losses, but that it will also generate interest and other income that will exceed its borrowing costs.
The budget watchdog also noted that the Fed did not lose money on its emergency lending during the 2008-09 financial crisis and in fact ending up handing over big profits to the federal government.
Holtz-Eakin said the politics are a lot different now. Back then, the government was widely criticized as bailing out banks that were responsible for the economy’s travails.
Today, “nobody caused the problem,” he said. “We’re just trying to get checks to American businesses to keep them afloat.”"

As Democratic leaders and the Trump administration negotiate an interim infusion of aid to small businesses, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and his Republican colleague Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana are looking further ahead.
The pair want to establish the half-trillion-dollar fund to help the states hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. The money would be divided into three tranches and distributed according to formulas that reflect population, infection rates and revenue loss.
Governors and mayors across the country have been pleading with the federal government for additional aid as tax revenues plummet and demands for resources skyrocket. More than 22 million people have been thrown out of work and businesses have shut or severely curtailed operations. At the same time, health care infrastructure has been stretched in many areas.
“The Covid-19 pandemic may not know state borders, but it has certainly hit some states and regions harder than others,” Menendez said in a statement. “The proverbial house is on fire and we need to focus the water on the hot spots, because if we don’t put the flames out, they will only jump until the entire block is up in smoke.”
‘Essential Services’
Menendez is a member of the Senate Banking Committee and Cassidy, a doctor, is a member of the Senate Finance Committee.
“Senator Menendez’s state and mine were hit hard by the Covid-19 epidemic,” Cassidy said in a statement. “We worked hard to make sure state and local governments can maintain essential services necessary for employees and employers to survive. We must protect Americans’ financial future.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer are in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to replenish a $349 billion fund that allows small businesses to continue to pay their employees amid widespread stay-at-home orders. Money in that fund ran out on Thursday.
The Democrats want additional aid for states and municipalities in the interim package, but Mnuchin said Sunday that’s not currently part of the deal being negotiated for quick approval by Congress.
Phase Four
There’s general agreement in Congress and at the White House that a so-called phase four comprehensive economic rescue package would be needed, following on the $2 trillion package approved late last month.
Menendez and Cassidy said they’re answering the call from the National Governors Association a week ago to establish a much larger “stabilization fund” for states.
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, the NGA’s chairman, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, its vice-chairman, said on April 11 that without at least $500 billion, states would have to curtail essential services. The pair are Republican and Democrat, respectively.
The federal stimulus approved in March provides $150 billion for municipalities’ virus expenses but doesn’t address budget shortfalls and only helps states and cities with populations greater than 500,000. The Federal Reserve announced loans to states and only cities with over 1 million residents.
Three Tranches
The fund proposed by Menendez and Cassidy would be divided into three equal tranches. The first would be would be allocated to states and territories according to their percentage of U.S. population. All states and the District of Columbia would receive at least $1.25 billion from this fund. Cities and counties with populations above 50,000 would also be eligible for aid.
The second and third tranches would be allocated according to a state’s share of the U.S. infection rate and loss of revenue funding resulting from shut-downs and stay-at-home orders.
Menendez and other Democrats are also pushing for the Fed to do more for state and local governments. They’re advocating for a permanent change to the Federal Reserve Act that would allow the Fed to purchase municipal debt on the open market under “unusual and exigent circumstances.”"

“We are determined to defend our national security [and] maritime borders,” Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said in an interview with Iranian state television. He added that any act by U.S. forces that endangers Iranian military or civilian ships “will be met with an immediate and decisive response.”
Salami made the remarks a day after President Trump said he had directed the U.S. Navy to “shoot down and destroy” Iranian gunboats that “harass” U.S. ships in the gulf.
The U.S. military said vessels belonging to the Revolutionary Guard came dangerously close to U.S. ships in the area last week.
Salami on Thursday blamed the incident on U.S. forces, accusing the American ships of “unprofessional and dangerous behavior.”
For decades, the Persian Gulf, where the United States maintains a significant military presence including the headquarters for the Navy’s 5th Fleet in Bahrain, has been the backdrop for military brushes and threats between Iran and the United States.
Iran has repeatedly warned that U.S. sanctions could prompt a retaliatory blockade of the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, the critical sea lane for oil tankers. Iranian fast boats also have come close to U.S. Navy vessels in the past, acts that the Pentagon has described as harassment, but no direct clashes have taken place.
But last year, the Revolutionary Guard said it downed a U.S. surveillance drone over the strait. Iranian forces also seized a British-flagged tanker last year in response to an Iranian tanker being held by the British territory of Gibraltar. Both vessels were later released.
The Revolutionary Guard directs all of Iran’s key military operations under the authority of the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But the Guard’s influence has been further bolstered during the coronavirus crisis, which has claimed more than 5,000 lives in Iran according to the country’s official death toll. Many outside experts, however, say the real tally could be higher.
The Guard — and its domestic paramilitary Basij force — have built medical facilities and taken the lead in enforcing quarantine measures.
The Revolutionary Guard’s most prominent commander, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in January, and its ranks have been hit especially hard by the virus, which has sickened or killed numerous leaders and soldiers.
But the economic blows from the pandemic and international sanctions also have struck directly at the Guard.
The Guard has a hand in almost every level of Iran’s economy — including construction, automating, defense production and oil — and could be hit directly from a collapse in oil prices and wider global shocks from the pandemic. In October, the International Monetary Fund predicted the Iranian economy would shrink by more than 9 percent this year.
The Revolutionary Guard and its foreign operations wing, the Quds Force, have been forced to curtail or freeze some of their activities, including in Syria, where Iran-backed militias are helping President Bashar al-Assad reclaim the last rebel strongholds in that country’s civil war. Social media postings in recent weeks have depicted fighters being redeployed to factories to sew surgical masks and gowns."
"April 23, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/23/danger-doing-what-you-think-trump-wants/,The Washington Post,The danger of doing what you think Trump wants,"Brian Kemp must have been shocked.
The Georgia governor knew President Trump was in such a hurry to resume economic activity that he was promoting unhinged protests against other governors’ stay-at-home orders. So Kemp no doubt figured that when he announced new steps toward reopening the economy in his state, Trump would praise him as a wise and courageous exemplar of can-do American spirit.
Then the opposite happened.
“I disagree, strongly, with his decision to open up facilities which are in violation of the Phase I guidelines,” Trump said at his briefing Wednesday. “It’s too soon. They can wait a bit longer.”
Making it all the more shocking, just that morning Trump had tweeted that “States are safely coming back. Our Country is starting to OPEN FOR BUSINESS again.”
Kemp is not the first person to do what they think Trump wants, only to see him turn on them. Just a few weeks ago acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly resigned after giving a Trump-esque speech to sailors in which he attacked their former captain, whom Trump himself had gone after. Like Kemp, Modly probably found himself asking, “Wait, what did I do wrong? Isn’t this what you wanted?”
Kemp couldn’t have known that just before Trump’s briefing, the scientists on his coronavirus task force had informed him that if they were asked about Kemp’s order, they’d say it was a mistake. That would have been a newsworthy conflict, one Trump decided to avoid.
Which illustrates an important principle of this presidency: While Trump may have temporary policy preferences, there’s one thing he will always care about more than anything else: his media image.
That’s something that’s constantly shifting, both in reality and in Trump’s perception. Which can leave people like Kemp and Modly tripping up when they’re trying so hard to satisfy the president.
When Modly gave that angry speech to the sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the result was an immediate wave of negative press coverage in which Modly was criticized from all sides. When that happens, Trump will rid himself of you even if you thought you were doing what he wanted.
Similarly, Kemp stuck his neck out by being the first governor to announce a dramatic (if partial) lifting of restrictions, allowing businesses such as gyms and hair salons to reopen. The result was a huge volume of negative media coverage. You can bet Trump, an avid consumer of news, was watching closely.
For all his eagerness to “reopen the economy,” Trump is surely aware of polls showing that only a tiny fraction of Americans think we should rush to reopen. The anti-lockdown protests he encouraged against Democratic governors are also turning out to be a PR disaster; in a new CBS News poll, the number of Americans who said Trump should be encouraging the protests was just 7 percent.
Trump may not be doing much to actually manage the crisis, but he is utterly consumed with how his management of the crisis is playing in the media. And when something isn’t working, he’s quick to change (and to deny he ever did or said what he did and said before).
So while you can never go wrong by offering embarrassingly sycophantic praise of Trump’s boundless strength and glorious leadership, when you try to act on what you think he wants, if circumstances shift — especially in the media — you can find yourself hung out to dry.
That creates endless confusion and delay for the creation and implementation of policy. When Trump announces a new policy in a late-night tweet, it leaves aides scrambling to figure out how to implement his latest impulsive idea. But if it becomes too controversial, he may abandon it with equally little warning.
A Republican governor is only slightly less dependent on Trump’s favor, and subject to his changing whims, than officials in his administration.
It was less than two weeks ago that Trump said the reopening of the country might begin before May 1. For some states, he said, “we think we’re going to be able to get them open fairly quickly, and then others will follow.” He even closed with a threat ""to come down on them very hard.”
Today, the president seems as worried about how the public will react if we resume activities and see a new wave of the virus as he is about how the public will react to keeping the lockdown in place too long.
Kemp’s biggest mistake may have been not keeping a close enough eye on media coverage and anticipating how Trump would react to it. He thought he could be the leader in carrying out Trump’s wishes, but by the time he did, Trump had changed his outlook.
So if you’re a Republican governor, you could try to guess how Trump will feel in a day or a week or a month, and do what you think he’ll want. Or you could just do what’s in the best interest of public health.
In a saner time and with a party less gripped by fear of its mercurial and erratic leader, it would be an easy choice."
"April 23, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-its-so-hard-to-overthrow-the-mighty-us-dollar/2020/04/23/5d15cee2-851f-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,The Washington Post,Why It’s So Hard to Overthrow the Mighty U.S. Dollar,"As the coronavirus outbreak reached pandemic status, people began panic buying staples: rice, pasta, noodles — and the U.S. dollar. The demand was so intense that the U.S. Federal Reserve stepped in to help foreign central banks and others get their hands on the greenback in March. It was a similar situation as during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, when calls grew louder for an end to the global dominance of a single currency. Yet, just over a decade on, the dollar still reigns supreme.
1. Why are some people fed up with the dollar?
Because of its sheer prevalence. The U.S. currency is on one side of almost 90% of foreign-exchange transactions and accounts for two-thirds of international debt. Virtually all international trades in oil are priced in dollars. Jean-Claude Juncker, the former president of the European Commission, said it was “absurd” that 80% of Europe’s energy imports are priced in dollars. The greenback’s ubiquity makes nations beholden to fluctuations in its value, ties their economies to decisions made in Washington and serves to amplify dangerous shocks to the financial system, like the one triggered by the pandemic.
2. How does that happen?
When the financial world is teetering, investors view the U.S. currency as the safest haven, even more so than gold, the yen or the Swiss franc. As the grim economic implications of the virus outbreak strained markets in March, demand for the dollar soared, pushing other currencies lower. Countries with significant debt denominated in dollars suddenly faced higher repayments just as they were confronted with looming recession. Banks — wary of lending to other banks during the eye of a financial storm — started hoarding the greenback, pushing gauges of funding stress to their highest levels in more than a decade. It was the Fed’s actions that prevented dollar shortfalls turning into currency crises.
3. Are there other drawbacks for some countries?
Ask Iran and Russia. The central role that U.S. banks and the dollar play in the global economy means that American politicians can exert leverage by imposing sanctions on countries, people or companies. Violators might see their American-based assets blocked or lose the ability to move money to or through accounts held in the U.S. A spate of such penalties pushed Russia to target faster “de-dollarization.” As President Vladimir Putin put it: “We aren’t ditching the dollar, the dollar is ditching us.”
4. Is dollar concern a new thing?
The U.S. currency has dominated since the end of World War II, when world leaders met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to establish a system to manage foreign exchange and linked their currencies to the dollar. The push to dial back the greenback has its origins partly in the 1998 currency crisis, when Asian nations got caught borrowing too many dollars and were plunged into recession. Fast forward a decade, and Asia’s amassing of dollars to build currency reserves helped fuel a U.S. credit binge that triggered the sub-prime mortgage crisis.
5. Is the dollar’s influence shrinking?
Hardly. The share of currency trades in dollars increased to 88.3% in 2019 from 87.6% in 2016, according to the Bank for International Settlements. The proportion of foreign reserves held in dollars has remained steady around 60% over the past decade. The currency’s usage in global payments tracked by financial institutions has risen since 2010. And credit extended to non-banks in dollars more than doubled over a decade to a record $12.1 trillion by September 2019.
6. Why is it hard to compete with the dollar?
Any move away from the greenback involves bother and expense. Shifting to the euro, yuan or ruble means higher costs and difficulty finding banks to handle business. Faced with U.S. sanctions, Russia has succeeded in loosening the dollar’s grip. The country now has a higher share of reserves in euros (30%) than in dollars (23%). The euro has also overtaken the dollar as Russia’s main currency in trade with China and is close to doing the same in trade with the European Union. But diversification comes with perils attached: When the dollar rallied in March, the value of Russia’s international reserves plunged by 5% in a week.
7. Can any currency take on the dollar?
There’s certainly a will. Putin said using the dollar as an instrument of pressure was “undermining its role as a global reserve currency.” Chinese President Xi Jinping more obliquely described “hegemonism” as a global challenge. Still, the yuan accounted for just 4% of currency trades in 2019 after China shifted its focus from turning it into a freely convertible currency without government restrictions to promoting it as a reserve currency and stable asset in times of stress. The euro, which was involved in 32% of foreign-exchange transactions in 2019, is the only currency that comes anywhere close to the dollar, but its allure was undermined by the region’s 2010 sovereign debt crisis and the European Central Bank’s use of negative interest rates. Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says it would be a mistake to switch one dominant currency for another; he advocates a global digital currency to supersede the dollar."

The Trump captivity of the GOP has reached its sad, inevitable destination: a failed presidency defended by a cowed party. As President Trump’s malignant narcissism and incompetence have been fully revealed — and can be objectively measured by the level of needless death from covid-19 — his approval among Republicans has remained strong. Across a continent filled with elected Republicans, only a few have taken a stand for sanity and effective governance.
Trump is, no doubt, in a perilous political situation. The activist right wing of his party has seized on social distancing as the health-care equivalent of socialism. The tea party fundraising machine has lurched into loud, clanking motion, trying to manufacture outrage against epidemiology. Some pro-life and pro-family groups have joined in the ill-timed promotion of social anarchy.
The president seldom defies the right-wing populists, and his immediate response was to identify with their anger. But this is a different political circumstance from any Trump has faced. In this case, pleasing the most vocal portion of his base puts another important constituency — older voters — at additional risk of painful, suffocating death. It is difficult to play both sides of this issue. And there are indications in recent polling that seniors have grown increasingly critical of Trump’s pandemic response.
Yet none of this is likely to change the minds of partisan Republicans. Some ignore or dismiss Trump’s cruelty and deception because conservative judges need to be appointed and the culture war needs to be fought. Some embrace his cruelty and deception because conservative judges need to be appointed and the culture war needs to be fought. And Trump naturally takes continued Republican job approval as an endorsement for his handling of the coronavirus crisis. In this way, Republican tolerance for Trump’s ineptitude and ignorance has made these traits more lethal.
It is sometimes useful to stare the worst possible political outcome full in the face. If Trump were reelected in November, he would place his stamp on Republican identity for a generation. The purges of dissidents would accelerate. Resistance within the party would dwindle from rare to vanishingly rare. A party of angry white people would head toward its demographic doom. And even then, Trump acolytes would probably reject ideological and racial outreach, preferring their resentments to the possibility of deliverance.
A reelection defeat for Trump would open up a small space for ideological reconsideration and renovation. Trump and his clan would not disappear. They would do anything they could to claw their way back to power. But if Trump loses, it will be because he alienated the suburban Republicans and independents that his party lost in the 2018 midterm elections. This would provide a window of opportunity for Republican leaders to combine a concern for the legitimate needs of rural and working-class whites with an agenda of upward economic mobility and minority outreach — and to do this while embracing the high cause of effective governance, capable of acting boldly to defend the health and security of the country.
For the past 150 years in American politics, ideological renewal has come through party factions. In the 1990s, center-left Democrats such as Bill Clinton did not found a third-way party. They created a New Democrat identity within the Democratic Party. Center-right Republicans are in desperate need of a similar effort.
For many, being center-right means combining a commitment to free-market economics with tolerant social values and strong national defense. That would be a large improvement over Trump’s combination of populism, nativism, racism and mercantilism.
For some of us, the ideal is more on the model of Christian social teaching — solidarity with the vulnerable, respect for value-shaping institutions, care for creation, the embrace of refugees and immigrants, and support for government that seeks the common good. This was basically the ideological framework for George W. Bush’s 2000 campaign (read his Philadelphia convention speech for proof). This was also once characteristic of a certain kind of Catholic Democrat.
Neither political party currently measures up to this ideal, nor cares to. But Joe Biden was shaped by it. While his policy views can be quite liberal, his political muscle memory comes from the Catholic social-justice tradition. He is, as his critics charge, a throwback. But to a saner time, with superior options. The beginning of reform for Republicans might be a vote for the Democratic candidate."

However, those wagers via the biggest American ETF -– the U.S. Oil Fund, or USO -– have contributed to market mayhem and helped push crude prices below zero.
1. What did the fund do?
It grew so huge so quickly that it became a sizable player in the market for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for crude. Investors piled in during March and April, convinced that oil prices that had been falling -- pushed down by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that boosted production just as demand was slashed by pandemic-driven lockdowns -- would eventually recover once economies reopened. At different stages, the fund held about a quarter of all May and June contracts for WTI.
2. What’s the problem?
Unlike shares that can be held as long as an investor chooses, oil futures have finite terms and are agreements to buy or sell a physical product. The May futures contract, for example, expired on April 21. Any holder who had not sold by then would need to take delivery of the oil -- 1,000 U.S. barrels, or 42,000 gallons, for each contract.
3. Where does USO come in?
As a favored investment vehicle for many bullish speculators, the number of shares in the fund ballooned from 145 million at the end of February to more than 1.4 billion by mid-April. Its outsized portion of the WTI market -– on paper -- came at a time when demand for physical oil was cratering and storage space was becoming harder and more expensive to find.
4. What does that have to do with the price plunge?
For years, USO was mandated to invest in the most-active WTI contract and to roll it over to the following contract. (Rolling over means selling it and, often simultaneously, buying the following month’s contract.) The flood of money into May contracts earlier had pushed oil prices up; as USO sold its May futures as part of the rollover and bought June and July contracts, prices fell for May and rose for the following months, opening an unusually wide spread. Only a handful of traders remained in the May contract on Monday, when prices plunged well below zero.
5. What’s the worry now?
With USO holding a significant level of June contracts, there are concerns that prices will go negative again and that the whole process might repeat -- or might be worse, if the April 20th debacle scares off more investors. To try to mitigate the prospect, USO, which lost 37% of its value in the first three weeks of April, has moved to allocate some holdings to contracts expiring later in the year, since those prices tend to be less volatile. But the fund is adding to pressure on oil prices in other ways.
6. How is that?
There was so much demand for USO that it exhausted the number of shares it was allowed to issue and, on April 20, asked regulators for permission to register an additional 4 billion, more than double the existing number. Until the new shares are cleared for issuance, the ETF will not purchase more futures contracts, according to analysts, potentially adding to pressure on crude prices. Without new oil contracts, the fund will also become untethered from the prices it’s supposed to track.
7. Anything else?
ETF prices are kept in sync with the value of their holdings, their so-called NAV (net-asset value), through the creation and redemption of shares. So-called “authorized participants” for instance sell an ETF when it’s rising and buy the underlying security to pocket a quick profit, keeping the fund’s price and NAV in lockstep in the process. However, with the authorized participants no longer able to create shares, that’s disrupted demand for the underlying contracts.
8. How about other ETFs?
USO is hardly the only exchange-traded fund to be hammered by the swings in oil futures; the effects were felt around the globe. The Samsung S&P GSCI Crude Oil ER Futures ETF, whose holdings of the derivatives slumped 26% on Tuesday to $378 million, saw its traded units lose half their value for a time Wednesday. Closing down 46% at HK$1.79, the ETF had its biggest drop and lowest finish since trading began in May 2016. Credit Suisse Group AG told investors in a leveraged exchange-traded note that tracks the price of oil they probably won’t get any money back after the value of the note dropped below zero."

Never mind that the three-month-old coronavirus crisis has led to more than $2.3 trillion in congressional appropriations, to say nothing of the $484 billion relief package that passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. Much of those funds, after all, aided small businesses and hospitals, sent direct payments to families and expanded unemployment insurance. All of this promises to blow an almost $4 trillion hole in the federal government’s 2020 budget.
Apparently, helping out U.S. states is a bridge too far for the Kentucky Republican. In a response to a question on the syndicated Hugh Hewitt radio program, McConnell declared, “I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route.” He added that “it’s saved some cities, and there’s no good reason for it not to be available.” Hewitt singled out California, Illinois and Connecticut, three states that just so happen to reliably vote Democratic (no mention of New Jersey, repeatedly downgraded during Republican Governor Chris Christie’s eight years).  
McConnell went on:
“My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don’t have to do that,” he said. “That’s not something I’m going to be in favor of.”
“I said yesterday we’re going to push the pause button here, because I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments needs to be thoroughly evaluated,” McConnell added.
“You raised yourself the important issue of what states have done, many of them have done to themselves with their pension programs,” he said. “There’s not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations.”
Again, never mind that an article from the latest Bloomberg Businessweek magazine is about how seven years after bankruptcy, Detroit is once again staring down a huge budget shortfall that puts it on the brink of a state takeover. Far from a panacea to get out from under onerous obligations, municipal bankruptcies have proved to be so messy, costly and time-consuming that they’re often not enough to solve the underlying issues. Case in point: Puerto Rico.
McConnell’s idea isn’t a novel one by any means. The idea of state bankruptcy was raised after the last recession, too, including by David Skeel, who now sits on the Financial Oversight & Management Board for Puerto Rico. He wrote an article for The Weekly Standard in November 2010 titled “Give States a Way to Go Bankrupt.” When I asked him about it in December 2011, after muni bonds posted a 10.7% return and a meltdown never materialized, he said “the political enthusiasm for the state bankruptcy idea has temporarily dimmed.” That’s one way of putting it. Here’s another from Bloomberg News’s William Selway and Danielle Moran: It was dropped after a single hearing in the House of Representatives. 
The concept of state bankruptcy as a solution to get through this unprecedented period is little more than a farce. Even President Donald Trump appears to realize that. After meeting with Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York on Tuesday, he said that states will need assistance, adding that “I think most Republicans agree, too, and Democrats.” Governors have asked for some $500 billion.
As much as McConnell tries, this is not about profligate Democratic governors and their underfunded public pension funds. At a basic, fundamental level, many states will have to impose draconian austerity measures without federal support because governors need to balance their budgets. That means either more state employees joining the ranks of the unemployed, higher tax rates (and therefore less money changing hands in local economies), further neglect of critical public infrastructure improvements, or once again shortchanging the pension promises of tomorrow to make the numbers add up today. Potentially all of the above.
Withholding state support, in other words, would directly counteract the measures that McConnell and his fellow senators have already set in motion to bolster the American economy. What good is a $1,200 check if states are backed into raising taxes that take most of it away? Will small businesses bounce back if their neighbors are unemployed, or local roads and bridges remain decrepit?
Fortunately, while McConnell and Republican senators have a “fulsome” discussion on whether and how to send more aid to state and local governments, the Federal Reserve has taken the unprecedented step I advocated for a year ago and will buy up to $500 billion in muni bonds. It was almost too predictable how this would play out: 
The easy answer would be directing more cash from the federal government to the states. But the 2009 stimulus program already transferred an unprecedented amount of money into state coffers and the results were middling at best. In the current political climate, and with U.S. deficits already running close to $1 trillion, it’s anyone’s guess whether a similar package could come together.
That means it might be up to the the Fed to get involved in the $3.8 trillion municipal-bond market to give states a much-needed boost.
For now, the muni market can take some solace in knowing the Fed has its back. That should prevent any sort of wild swings like last month. And it buys some time for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that a “major package” of aid for state and local government will be in the next stimulus legislation considered by Congress, putting her clearly at odds with McConnell.
For all the posturing, no politician truly wants to impose austerity. Just before the 2018 midterm elections, McConnell brought up the idea of slashing spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and that’s gone nowhere. Expect the same for state bankruptcy."

Larry Hogan (R) recently said, “A major [novel coronavirus] outbreak among our critical federal workforce could be catastrophic, crippling the national response.” 
That provides a very valuable lesson on multiple fronts. Decentralization would limit the risk of disruption to essential services and lower the cost of operations. That includes a reduced cost of services for agencies remaining in the D.C. area, which would have lower demand for housing, commercial real estate and transportation.
Concentration of federal jobs and government contractors around the Capital Beltway has shielded the D.C. metropolitan area from severe economic shocks familiar to most of the rest of the country, particularly the South and the Midwest. Centralized operation is not only no longer necessary; it also creates considerable risk. Concentration within a small geographic area invites a targeted attack, whether by terrorists or pandemics that feed on proximity.
Capability to access and share sensitive information from anywhere via secure networks already allows department heads, executives, staff and contractors to work from locations thousands of miles apart, as thoroughly demonstrated by this nationwide shutdown. Why not take full advantage and relocate agencies throughout the country to more equitably return taxpayers’ dollars? In addition to stabilizing other local economies, an infusion of highly skilled federal personnel and contractors would raise the overall standard of living in every scenario. The transition could occur in phases over time to minimize disruption to services and current employees."

The court ruled 6 to 3 that a wastewater treatment plant in Hawaii could not avoid provisions of the act, which regulates the release of pollutants into rivers, lakes and seas, by pumping the pollutants first into groundwater, from which they eventually reach the ocean.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer’s compromise language said an Environmental Protection Agency permit is required when a discharge is “the functional equivalent” of a direct release into navigable waters.
While environmentalists had won a broader victory in the lower court, they were happy to accept the Supreme Court’s ruling.
“This decision is a huge victory for clean water,” said David Henkin, an attorney for Earthjustice who argued the case. “The Supreme Court has rejected the Trump administration’s effort to blow a big hole in the Clean Water Act’s protections for rivers, lakes and oceans.”
While the case must go back to lower courts, Henkin said, “we fully expect that Maui County’s sewage plant will be required to get a Clean Water Act permit [requiring] the county to protect the ocean from sewage discharges in a way it has refused to do to date.”
The ruling was one of three the court issued on its website Thursday, as justices continued to work mostly from home because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The court still must decide some cases argued earlier in the term, such as whether federal law covers LGBTQ workers from discrimination, and if the Trump administration may end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects immigrants brought to this country as children.
In the Hawaii case, environmental law experts agreed that the court’s decision will resonate.
The test endorsed by the court’s majority is “one under which environmentalists can prevail in most every kind of case that environmentalists have brought under the Clean Water Act,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law expert at Harvard Law School.
Some lawyers criticized it as vague, and the EPA was noncommittal about how it would be implemented, emphasizing some specifics in the ruling rather than its bottom line.
“Moving forward, we will respect the court’s finding that ‘as to groundwater pollution and non-point source pollution, Congress intended to leave substantial responsibility and autonomy to the states,’ ” EPA spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer said in a statement.
“In holding that the Clean Water Act requires a permit for the addition of pollutants to groundwater if it is the ‘functional equivalent’ of a direct discharge, the court unfortunately leaves some uncertainty for the public, including private property owners.”
All agree that sewage plants and others must get a permit under the Clean Water Act when they produce pollutants that go directly into a body of navigable water.
Maui County injects 3 million to 5 million gallons of treated wastewater into four deep injection wells about a half-mile from the shore. Some of that wastewater gets into groundwater, which tests have shown eventually reaches the Pacific Ocean. Environmentalists said the polluted water had damaged a coral reef.
But the issue also can affect agricultural interests, mining companies and home builders, and some justices worried during arguments that it could even impact individual homeowners with septic tanks.
During the Obama administration, the EPA had sided with environmentalists in the case. But it reversed its position after President Trump took office and said discharges into groundwater fell largely outside the law. Only direct discharges into navigable waters were covered, it said.
Breyer wrote that the administration’s interpretation could not be right. All a polluter would need to avoid regulation, for instance, would be to end a discharge pipe just before reaching the water, he said.
“We do not see how Congress could have intended to create such a large and obvious loophole in one of the key regulatory innovations of the Clean Water Act,” Breyer wrote.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that a permit was required if the pollution was “fairly traceable” to a source. But Breyer said that was too broad, allowing “EPA to assert permitting authority over the release of pollutants that reach navigable waters many years after their release (say, from a well or pipe or compost heap) and in highly diluted forms.”
He had proposed the “functional equivalent” standard when the case was argued, and he acknowledged then and in Thursday’s opinion that it could be criticized as vague.
“But there are too many potentially relevant factors applicable to factually different cases for this court now to use more specific language,” he said. He proposed a seven-factor test, and said it will evolve through EPA regulations and lower court decisions.
Breyer was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch dissented.
They said the majority’s decision is not supported by the text of the law and leaves too many questions unanswered.
“The court makes up a rule that provides no clear guidance and invites arbitrary and inconsistent application,” Alito wrote in his dissent. Water authorities won’t know if they are covered, and “regulators are given the discretion, at least in the first instance, to make of this standard what they will. And the lower courts? The Court’s advice, in essence, is: ‘That’s your problem. Muddle through as best you can.’ ”"

Kura Sushi USA, Inc., a restaurant chain with 25 locations in five U.S. states, is giving back about $6 million in proceeds, according to a regulatory filing. The company said it had entered into the lending agreement last week.
The company joins Shake Shack Inc. and Sweetgreen Inc. in returning loans after media reports pointed out that several large firms had received financial support. The stimulus program being run by the Small Business Administration was aimed at firms with as many as 500 employees. But a lobbyist-backed loophole allowed for restaurant chains to receive funds.
A second round of funding aims to limit large companies from applying.
Kura has about 1,400 workers and annual sales of $64 million. All its restaurants have been closed because of the coronavirus. To combat that, last week it entered into a $20 million revolving credit facility.
The company, based in Irvine, California, didn’t immediately respond to an request for comment.
In a letter posted on the company’s website, Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Uba said the company initially interpreted the bill as “a deliberate effort by lawmakers to further support the restaurant industry, whether you have one or multiple restaurants.”
When it became clear the funds wouldn’t be enough for everyone, the company returned the loan because “our finances allow us to weather financial hardship for a longer period than independent restaurant owners,” Uba said."
"April 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/private-equity-to-get-squeezed-out-of-another-stimulus-program/2020/04/23/f70bdd9a-8540-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,The Washington Post,Private Equity to Get Squeezed Out of Another Stimulus Program,"Private equity’s decade-long debt binge is coming back to haunt it when it comes to obtaining the U.S. government’s coronavirus aid.
Already largely shut out of the popular small business rescue loan program, the industry is now realizing that it’s likely to be excluded from the Federal Reserve’s $600 billion lending initiative because it bars companies that have loaded up on borrowed money. The prohibition strikes at the heart of the buyout-shop business model, where firms saddle the companies they purchase with debt in order to mint bigger profits on their investments.
Though the Fed’s “Main Street” lending facility for mid-size businesses doesn’t specifically preclude private equity-owned companies, executives say they’ve concluded that the tough terms will prevent many of their firms from qualifying. Some politicians and investors say that may not be a bad thing, especially because taxpayer dollars are on the line.
“It’d be teaching irresponsible risk takers to take irresponsible risks” if the Fed signed-off on loans to these companies, said Arena Investors Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zwirn. “You don’t have to be a math genius” to know how highly leveraged private-equity buyouts have been in recent years.
Private equity has used debt as jet fuel for acquisitions because ultra low interest rates have made financing cheap and easy to obtain. It’s a lucrative strategy because the more firms rely on borrowed money, the less cash they have to put up and the higher the returns. As leverage on deals increased and safeguards protecting lenders eroded, regulators began sounding alarms. But the practice continued with many on Wall Street saying it was just pushed to less regulated shadow banks.
Private-equity firms have completed more than 15,000 buyouts since 2010, including almost 2,000 in 2018, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Private-equity firms that focus on smaller middle-market companies inked a record $500 billion of deals in 2019, according to data provider PitchBook. As of last year, leveraged buyouts had left purchased companies with $119 billion of borrowed money, including debt those businesses may have held prior to the acquisitions, according to Covenant Review data.
In the Main Street program, loans top out at $150 million and will be distributed by banks and then purchased by the Fed. For a business taking out a new loan, its existing leverage can’t exceed four times its 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If a company wants to add to an existing bank loan, its debt load can’t be more than six times Ebitda.

Private equity firms and their trade association, the Washington-based American Investment Council, have been pressing the Fed to allow more flexibility in assessing who’s eligible. The central bank is expected to release the final rules for the lending facility in the coming days. Right now, the Fed is reviewing a deluge of comment letters on its plans, a response that underscores how desperate Corporate America is for government cash during the economic slump.
A Fed spokesman declined to comment.
Democrats’ Opposition
If the industry fails to persuade the Fed, it will likely continue pressing Congress to ensure portfolio companies are included in future virus-related stimulus legislation. However, that’s unlikely to be an easy task. Progressive Democratic lawmakers argue that private-equity firms don’t deserve aid because they enrich Wall Street executives at the expense of working people.
Congress already kept most private-equity owned companies out of the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program, a Small Business Administration effort that launched earlier this month. Though PPP quickly ran out of money, a new infusion of funding is expected to be approved Thursday. The firms, however, have argued that the more than 8 million workers its companies employ shouldn’t be penalized just because of who owns the businesses.
Read More: Private Equity Ends Up Losing in $2 Trillion Virus BillUnlike the small business program, where most of the government-guaranteed loans are likely to be forgiven, the Fed’s Main Street facility offers low-interest funding that is expected to be eventually paid back. Banks will also accept some of the risk, retaining 5% of the loan and selling 95% to the Fed.
Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped many Democrats and consumer groups from urging that buyout companies be excluded.
“We expect that highly aggressive and sophisticated entities such as large private equity firms will seek out opportunities to channel funding to reward capital owners instead of supporting workers,” Americans for Financial Reform, which advocates for tough Wall Street rules, wrote in a Fed comment letter.
Deciding Factor
The deciding factor in whether private-equity owned businesses ultimately get loans could be whether the Fed grants flexibility in assessing a borrower’s indebtedness.
In a comment letter sent to the Fed last week, the American Investment Council said banks should be able to “retain some discretion” in calculating leverage. A “one size fits all” method would exclude many companies, the association wrote, noting that would go against lawmakers’ goal of spreading funds far and wide.
“The shared policy imperative is for necessary relief and liquidity to reach all parts of the economy and not unfairly to penalize employees, suppliers, business people and communities that the administration and Congress sought to help,” the the lobbying group wrote.
Private-equity firms are also asking the Fed to modify another restriction on the loans: a prohibition on using the money to pay down existing debt.
Fed’s Creation
Privately, the industry complains that the Fed’s leverage limits are taking aim at a practice that the central bank itself has encouraged through its own monetary policy. Since the 2008 economic crisis, interest rates have remained low and are currently at zero -- a decision that has encouraged borrowing by corporations of all sizes.
Low rates have also pushed investors to buy risky assets in an effort to generate higher returns. That has contributed to the flood of money into assets such as collateralized loan obligations, securities containing loans to extremely indebted corporations. Private equity owns many companies whose loans have been packaged into CLOs.

The explosive growth of the leveraged-lending market in recent years has been a particular worry for the Fed and other regulators, due to concerns that banks might end up sitting on piles of soured loans and that a wave of borrowers could default, magnifying the impacts of a recession.
Cutting Rules
The Fed and other agencies even issued a standard in 2013 for what they considered safe leveraged lending, though they stopped enforcing it three years ago amid the Trump administration’s rollback of regulations.
Besides the limit on debt and the requirement that companies won’t use cash to pay down previous loans, the Fed’s new lending program sets other constraints that could be unwelcome for private equity. Borrowers must attest that they’re making reasonable efforts to retain employees and that they will adhere to limits on executive compensation and buying back shares."

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the fund is intended for small businesses, and large companies that have already taken loan funding are being given until May 7 to return it without penalty amid an uproar over Shake Shack Inc. and the operator of Ruth’s Chris steak houses and other firms getting relief aid.
New guidance released Thursday by the Treasury Department and the U.S. Small Business Administration emphasizes that companies must “certify in good faith” the economic need for financing under the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP.
The guidance was issued after small businesses complained that large, publicly traded companies and big chains were getting loans while they were shut out in the initial $349 billion in funding for loans. That money ran out in just 13 days, and the U.S. House approved a relief bill Thursday that includes an additional $320 billion for PPP, allowing for $10 billion in bank fees and processing costs.
“It is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification,” the guidance says.
Lenders may rely on a borrower’s certification, and borrowers that previously applied for a PPP loan and repay it in full by May 7 “will be deemed by SBA to have made the required certification in good faith,” according to the guidance.
Chains including Shake Shack and Sweetgreen Inc. and Ruth’s Hospitality Group Inc. have said they’re returning their loans.
Mnuchin said he’s giving other companies the benefit of the doubt that they didn’t understand the conditions of the program.
“If you pay back the loan right away, you won’t have liability to the SBA and to Treasury,” Mnuchin said at the White House briefing on Tuesday. “But there are severe consequences for people who don’t attest properly to this certification.”
Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida tweeted on Monday that “any company that doesn’t need a PPP loan but got one made a false representation.” He also announced that the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship that he leads will conduct “aggressive oversight” of the program this fall, including subpoena power to determine whether companies made false certifications to obtain loans.
The PPP offers loans of as much as $10 million that convert to grants if proceeds are used to keep workers on the payroll and cover rent and other approved expenses for about two months, a stopgap designed to help businesses get by until the economy reopens.
Dallas hotel executive Monty Bennett, who is also a major donor to President Donald Trump has emerged as the biggest winner from the coronavirus bailout for small businesses. A combined total of $59 million from the small business lending package went to three lodging companies chaired by Bennett, according to regulatory filings."
"April 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/one-country-one-system-the-week-that-china-shredded-its-promise-on-hong-kong/2020/04/24/247fb3e6-7001-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html,The Washington Post,"One country, one system: The week that China shredded its promise on Hong Kong","HONG KONG — Martin Lee has tangled with the Chinese Communist Party countless times in his decades-long fight to achieve free elections in Hong Kong and enlist Western support for the city's democratic ambitions.
Last weekend, the police came knocking. Seven officers appeared at Lee’s home and arrested the 81-year-old for participating in an unauthorized protest last year that 1.7 million people attended. More than a dozen other democracy activists were detained the same day.
The arrests buttressed a week of coordinated actions by Beijing that experts say have redefined the status of Hong Kong. The effect was to demolish the “one country, two systems” framework that prohibits Beijing’s involvement in local affairs and is supposed to afford the financial center a high level of autonomy.
“The very important story is not my arrest,” Lee, who helped draft Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, said in an interview after being released on bail. “What really concerns me is that the basic promise of Hong Kong has been completely changed.”
With the world distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, China has carried out a power grab in the former British colony, whose way of life it had pledged to preserve until 2047. In recent days, authorities have said for the first time that Beijing’s representative offices in the territory can “supervise” Hong Kong’s internal affairs — a step that legal experts say violates its constitutional firewall with the mainland. The Basic Law stipulates that the city should run its own affairs, including the police and immigration system, apart from defense and foreign relations.
Beijing officials also called for Hong Kong to introduce a national security law — shelved when an earlier attempt at its introduction sparked massive protests in 2003 — and reached further into the city’s legislature with attacks on pro-democracy lawmakers.
The shift “signals the death of the ‘two systems,’ ” said Eric Cheung, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong. “It is quite clear that they are now bringing the mainland system, the mainland idea of supervision and rule of law, here.”
The upshot is that the Hong Kong the world knew — a capitalist enclave where political freedoms were protected and the rule of law applied — is severely compromised.
As Washington prepares its annual report on the Hong Kong Policy Act, the legislation that allows the United States to treat the territory differently from mainland China and underpins Hong Kong’s status as a financial center, China’s actions raise an urgent question: How long can Hong Kong be seen as apart from the mainland?
No path forward
Western diplomats in the city now worry that its institutions have become irreversibly co-
opted by Beijing. The immigration department has emerged as a particular weak point, along with the police. Western businesses fear they will be caught up in a crackdown that until now has largely affected foreign activists, journalists and academics, the diplomats say, undercutting Hong Kong’s future as a place to do business.
“There has been absolutely no dialogue or reconciliation over the events of last year,” said a senior Western diplomat in Hong Kong. “No one can see a path forward.”
A spokesman for the Hong Kong government, in response to questions from The Washington Post, reiterated that the territory has a “high degree of autonomy” and has complied with the Basic Law since its return to China in 1997.
“The ‘one country, two systems’ principle has been fully and successfully implemented,” the spokesman said.
Protests gripped Hong Kong last year over a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. As the unrest broadened into a push for full democracy, months of sometimes violent clashes ensued that reshaped the relationship between Hong Kong’s people and the police, whom many now view as a political force executing Beijing’s orders.
The demonstrations also provoked warnings from Beijing of an impending crackdown as well as a reshuffle of its representative offices in the territory.
The immigration department began denying certain individuals visas or entry to Hong Kong for unstated reasons. The Post has tallied at least nine cases since September in which foreign journalists, activists and academics were told they could not enter Hong Kong after arriving at the border or were denied employment visas.
Those denied entry included Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who flew to Hong Kong in January to launch the organization’s yearly report.
“She seemed utterly clueless and didn’t know who I was,” Roth said of the immigration officer who handled his case. “When finally the decision came and I asked her why I was being denied, she kept repeating it was for ‘immigration reasons.’ ”
An immigration officer in Hong Kong said that decisions involving “sensitive” people ­seeking to enter the territory are not made by individual officers, who are usually empowered to grant or refuse permission, but rather are made as mandatory consensus decisions. He declined to say who issued the instructions.
“Whoever [Roth] met at the counter, the decision would have been the same,” he said.
Roth had visited Hong Kong in the past and as an American should have been allowed 90 days’ visa-free entry. Human Rights Watch was among the organizations Beijing said in December it would penalize in retaliation for U.S. legislation that supported democratic aspirations in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong government has said it cannot comment on individual cases or reveal the circumstances of denials. In response to The Post, a spokesman for the government added that an “individual case does not have any bearing on the overall policy” of Hong Kong to “welcome and facilitate” visitors, and that it rejected about 50,000 people last year.
Redefining borders
The blurring of Hong Kong’s borders intensified in February when Chinese government officials told Wall Street Journal editors that three of their reporters, expelled from mainland China, should also steer clear of Hong Kong as they would be refused permission to work there, according to people familiar with the matter. Those instructions were never made public by the Journal. A spokesman for Dow Jones, the Journal’s publisher, declined to comment.
When China expelled more than a dozen American reporters last month, its Foreign Ministry said they would also be barred from working as journalists in Hong Kong.
The city’s government has said it respects press freedom but has not specifically addressed calls to clarify its purview to determine who can enter or work in Hong Kong.
“The unfortunate thing is that they can’t do anything about Beijing’s interference and they cannot explain it, so the only thing they can do is reiterate that nothing has changed,” said Charles Mok, a Hong Kong lawmaker who represents the city’s technology sector.
Concerns were mounting even before the protests, Mok said. In the summer of 2018, he and other officials met representatives of a large U.S. social media company that was considering building a data center in Hong Kong.
“In our meeting, we were assuring them for almost two hours that the rule of law in Hong Kong still had primacy, but their main concern was interference from China and whether it would become an issue,” he said.
The company’s officials were slated to visit Hong Kong later that year to meet government representatives, Mok said. They canceled their visit when news broke that Hong Kong refused to renew a work visa for Victor Mallet, the Financial Times’ Asia news editor, who had hosted a talk with a Hong Kong independence activist.
In response to questions from The Post, Facebook said it meets regularly with stakeholders around the world to discuss business and investments and in 2018 was in talks about a new office in Hong Kong. This month, U.S. officials allowed a Google high-speed Internet link to Taiwan to proceed only if it bypassed Hong Kong, citing national security concerns.
For many observers, a more concerning development came last week, when China’s top office in Hong Kong said it was effectively above the city’s mini-constitution and unbound by an article that bars the Chinese government from involving itself in the city’s local affairs. The Hong Kong government responded by issuing three conflicting statements within a few hours. Its final version agreed with the premise set down by the Chinese liaison office.
This week, the official in charge of the ministry that handles affairs with mainland China was replaced in a wider cabinet reshuffle. He was replaced by the immigration director, Erick Tsang, who displays photos of Chinese leader Xi Jinping in his office.
Lau Siu-kai, vice president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, which advises the central government on Hong Kong matters, said the past few days’ events represented a “hard-line approach” to the city’s political crisis and aimed to reinvigorate the “fighting spirit and patriotic forces.”
Lee, the veteran democracy leader, said the developments leave no doubt that Beijing’s plan is to “squeeze” Hong Kong.
“The Communist Party is ruling Hong Kong, that is clear,” Lee said. “Perhaps [the situation] presents an opportunity and can invite the U.S. government and others to look at the Hong Kong situation afresh.”"
"April 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/we-need-real-oversight-of-2-trillion-in-stimulus-money-trump-wont-provide-it/2020/04/24/5eaa8dba-84de-11ea-9728-c74380d9d410_story.html,The Washington Post,We need real oversight of $2 trillion in stimulus money. Trump won’t provide it.,"The law creating the huge coronavirus pandemic relief effort calls for an executive director of an oversight panel to be named by Monday.
Not a minute too soon.
With a flow of $2 trillion from Washington, and more on the way, the need to protect against unintended consequences from the stimulus effort is increasingly clear.
Now Democrats and some Republicans in Congress, jolted by President Trump’s actions against inspectors general, are working to protect the independence of that corps of federal auditors and investigators who probe government spending.
National hotel and restaurant chains claimed millions of dollars in stimulus money before the program ran out of money last week, leaving many small businesses unable to get funding. The Washington Post also reported that to satisfy debts, bill collectors and banks are hijacking payments meant for individuals’ living expenses during a period of shocking unemployment and long lines for free food.
Even without the Trump administration’s rickety rollout, a quickly crafted $2 trillion emergency program would cry out for oversight — but not from a self-interested president. “I’ll be the oversight,” Trump said as the relief package was being negotiated with Congress.
Yet, toward that end, Trump beheaded the program’s Pandemic Response Accountability Committee before it could hold anyone accountable by effectively removing the panel’s chairman, Glenn Fine, then the head of the Defense Department’s Office of Inspector General.
Under the relief legislation, Monday is the deadline for the committee’s executive director to be appointed by Michael Horowitz, the chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. He also is the Justice Department inspector general.
Horowitz’s office would not say when a new committee head will be appointed. Nothing in the language of the law prevents Horowitz from appointing himself to the post. He would be an experienced, well-regarded candidate.
Trump’s decision to remove Fine as acting defense inspector general, while allowing him to remain as principal deputy, was another administration strike against oversight. Those actions have increased calls by Republicans and Democrats to protect the watchdogs’ independence from Trump’s attacks.
Legislation proposed by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) would provide inspectors general (IGs) seven-year terms and prevent Trump and future presidents from firing them without specific reasons, including “permanent incapacity, inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or conviction of a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude.”
“This administration is waging a war on oversight. It’s not just the recent firing of inspectors general. It’s also the way in which they haven’t protected whistleblowers,” Murphy said by telephone. “It makes sense to give IGs some protection from the capriciousness of the executive branch.”
Warning against Trump’s attempts “to weaponize independent oversight,” Murphy said that if inspectors general think “they will be fired the minute that they start to get crosswise with the administration, then it will chill the interest of any IG to point out wrongdoing.”
Trump wants “to protect himself politically from these IGs by making them all understand that they really have no political protection if they do their job,” Murphy said.
Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) led the way in writing a bipartisan Senate letter to Trump after he initiated a rare IG firing of Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community’s inspector general.
Performing “by the book,” in the words of Joseph Maguire, then the acting director of national intelligence, Atkinson reported to Congress the whistleblower’s complaint that led to Trump’s impeachment over his attempt to pressure Ukraine for his personal political benefit. Trump saw that as an act of disloyalty, apparently thinking inspectors general should have fealty to him instead of to their responsibilities as federal watchdogs.
The senators’ letter told Trump that the law requires him to inform Congress of the reasons for removing an intelligence IG at least 30 days in advance. Telling Congress that he no longer has “the fullest confidence’’ in Atkinson, they wrote, “without further explanation, is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the statute.”
By naming an acting replacement for Atkinson and putting him on 30 days’ leave, the letter said, “the administration has already effectively removed that IG and appears to have circumvented Congress’s role in this process.”
The senators told Trump to respond to this point and to “provide more detailed reasoning for the removal of Inspector General Atkinson no later than April 13, 2020,” a deadline Trump missed. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the letter or Murphy’s legislation.
In a separate letter supporting IGs from Grassley to Trump on Wednesday, the senator said “even the appearance of political interference in their process cannot be tolerated.”
In the House, 20 Democratic chairmen wrote Horowitz “to express our grave concerns with President Donald Trump’s attempts to undermine the independence and integrity of Inspectors General across the government. Unlike any President in modern history, President Trump has engaged in offensive and unjustified attacks against Inspectors General, criticizing them for following the law, and retaliating against them for telling the truth.”
In addition to cases involving Atkinson and Fine, the Democrats, led by Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (N.Y.), chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, noted Trump’s verbal attack on Christi Grimm, the Department of Health and Human Services principal deputy inspector general. Earlier this month, she released a report that cited “severe shortages of testing supplies and extended waits for test results.” This reality conflicts with Trump’s bogus narrative that “anybody that needs a test can have a test . . . and the tests are all perfect.”
It’s that attitude of presidential infallibility that troubles Murphy.
“I worry if Trump gets away with these attacks on IGs,” he said, “other presidents will do the same.”"
"April 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/24/public-health-isnt-enemy-economic-well-being/,The Washington Post,Public health isn’t the enemy of economic well-being,"Many on the right have concluded the economic damage done by social distancing — which has essentially shut down large swaths of the American economy — is not worth it. They are agitating, with some success in such places as Georgia and South Carolina, to reopen the economy regardless of the health risks of spreading the coronavirus and the potential loss of life. President Trump, too, has signaled he hears them, though he said Wednesday that he strongly disagreed with the decision of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to end certain restrictions.
But this dichotomy — that we must choose economy or health — is a false one, as many economists have argued. In the 19th century, reformers broke the false dichotomy between health and the economy by arguing that “health is wealth.” While this has become a pithy slogan in modern times, it had a far more significant meaning in its earliest days. We need to resurrect this understanding and use it to convince government officials that regularly and consistently investing in public health bolsters human and economic well-being. Ignoring public health considerations, by contrast, is a recipe for driving the economy down.
Setting up a false binary between health and economy has a long history of influencing political decisions in the United States. When businessmen doubled as political leaders, as was the case in many 19th-century cities (and again today), they made decisions to advance their own interests. This often meant refusing health investigations that might harm their real estate values and rejecting sanitary provisions for which they would have to pay directly, such as landlords improving housing conditions.
Political leaders were reluctant to enact measures that might interfere with the local economy in the short term. Quarantines, the most common method of disease prevention, for example, stopped the flow of goods and people into port cities — thereby halting trade and slowing the marketplace. Even when an epidemic was imminent, city governments accordingly were slow to enforce quarantine measures and drew ire because quarantines disrupted local businesses and jobs.
The results were catastrophic: In the decades before the Civil War, epidemics of yellow fever and cholera regularly ravaged American cities; the death toll from routinely occurring endemic diseases, such as typhoid, was also high.
To stem this deadly tide, physicians urged governments at all levels to change their priorities. Rather than invest solely in improvements for business and trade, such as costly waterfront and railroad projects, physicians and reformers pushed governments to regularly invest in proactive public health measures that would improve sanitary conditions and prevent diseases, thereby sustaining economic growth in the long run.
The pithy argument that “health is wealth” was a key ingredient of this successful pressure campaign. When this phrase emerged in the 1840s and 1850s, it was not an empty platitude that individuals should be grateful for their health, as it became over time, but a political argument that health, by enabling labor, created the nation’s wealth and required protection.
This argument proved convincing because public health reformers appealed to politicians’ and businessmen’s shared bottom line: profits. Reformers had long criticized capitalism for creating overcrowded and unsanitary conditions that fostered disease, but they grasped that they could also use the logic of capitalism to advance public health.
Adam Smith had argued “labor is wealth,” and New York City physician John Hoskins Griscom built on that argument when he asserted “the health of the people affect[s] the capacity and interests of the state.” Public health reformers like Griscom based their arguments upon labor because health determined how productive individuals and the entire labor force could be. Health was the necessary prerequisite for wealth.
“Health is wealth” was the shorthand for this argument and ultimately the motto for public health organizations across the country. Businessmen found this logic compelling in extreme moments, such as when Chicago’s Board of Trade feared that nose guard-wearing dockworkers would stop working to avoid inhaling disease-causing miasmas or when the 1863 draft riots pushed sanitary conditions and economic inequality to the forefront of New York City politics. In both of these moments, businessmen agreed with reformers that health was necessary for labor and labor was necessary for business, pressuring city governments to enact health measures. Businessmen’s actions had long-term consequences: After the draft riots, New York’s businessmen chartered a sanitary survey that led to the 1866 creation of the Metropolitan Board of Health, the United States’ first permanent board of health staffed by physicians and scientists.
As an argument and a motto, “health is wealth” justified spending government money on such sanitary measures as cleaning streets, supplying clean water, installing sewer lines and spraying disinfectants in public places. Through boards of health, cities also began regulating “nuisances detrimental to health,” a category that included noxious byproducts released by industries; we call them pollutants today. Doing so ensured that people would be able to work and that the economy would continue to generate profits.
To those who questioned the cost of these measures, Massachusetts reformer Lemuel Shattuck reminded them that public health “is not an expense, but an investment … which is designed to add to the wealth and not to the poverty of the Commonwealth.”
American businessmen and politicians seized upon this promise, but in the process they diluted the motto’s original meaning. In New Orleans, businessmen who had lost control of the city during the Civil War and Reconstruction, rallied around “Public Health is Public Wealth” to reclaim the city government after the devastating yellow fever epidemic of 1878. To redeem their city’s reputation as an economic center, these businessmen approached public health as a business problem and argued that health directly increased wealth — but this was more sloganeering than a sign of a deep commitment to public health.
Similarly, patent medicine producers started advertising their dubious wares under the slogan “health is wealth,” convincing individuals that they could purchase health for themselves regardless of their living conditions. Advertisements adjusted the phrase into a self-help mantra, such as those for Dr. Radway & Company’s medicines that asserted “health of the body is wealth of mind” throughout the 1880s.
Today, however, we need to return this phrase to its original meaning. Public health is a prerequisite for a functional — or booming — economy. And failing to adequately invest in public health over time has made the pandemic worse and necessitated the lockdown that has proved so economically damaging."
"April 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/24/making-it-easier-declare-bankruptcy-could-avert-economic-catastrophe/,The Washington Post,Making it easier to declare bankruptcy could avert economic catastrophe,"Even legislators recognize that the $2 trillion stimulus passed by Congress won’t be sufficient to sustain the American economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, already moving to pass an addition while talking about the next big step.
One tool is receiving little attention but should be a big part of their plans: bankruptcy. Congress can prevent a long-lasting depression by making it simpler for businesses, large and small, incorporated and unincorporated, to petition to reorganize their debts in bankruptcy — which automatically stops debt collection and can prevent what President Herbert Hoover called “futile and destructive” liquidation of businesses. If they were able to petition for protection in bankruptcy, businesses could remain intact, and workers could return to work when social distancing measures are lifted.
But for this to be most effective, Congress must expand the definition of a “small business” to include companies with debts up to $10 million, up from the current $2.7 million. Lawmakers can also eliminate filing fees and reduce paperwork requirements so that a lawyer’s help is not necessary for an initial bankruptcy filing. The Small Business Administration can help by providing information about recent improvements to reorganization of debts in bankruptcy as part of its outreach regarding the stimulus’s expansion of the small-business lending program, which may expand further in the coming weeks.
Stopping debt collection is crucial: Without the tool of bankruptcy, in times of crisis, even solid businesses fare poorly. During the early years of the Great Depression, businesses that depended on mortgages and lines of credit could not get respite from creditors who needed cash. Creditors went to court, often forcing businesses in relatively good shape to liquidate. A similar scenario played out during the Great Recession: Sound firms went under.
The risk of a repeat underscores that this isn’t a typical recession, when weak businesses die, and strong businesses survive. This is different — more akin to wartime. We may see the destruction of the economy’s capacity to produce due entirely to the pandemic rather than economic factors. Bankruptcy can help mitigate the impact.
Under the bankruptcy law passed by Congress in 1898, failed businesses were typically liquidated. An investigation into the operation of this new provision began in New York before the onset of the Great Depression. It was unrelated to economic conditions.
While it was ongoing, several banking crises in 1930 and 1931 caused sound firms to go under and helped turn the recession that began in 1929 into the Great Depression. As the recession deepened, the Hoover administration brought high-level staff from the New York review to conduct a national review of bankruptcy procedure. After a lengthy investigation, the reviewers recommended that alternatives to liquidation be added to bankruptcy law.
In the final weeks of his presidency, Hoover begged Congress to act. But not until the day before President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s inauguration — after a 30 percent rise in business bankruptcy and with unemployment at 25 percent — did Congress amend the bankruptcy law to slow the liquidation of small businesses and farms.
The amendment allowed businesses and farmers to use bankruptcy to propose spreading out payments and reorganizing debt with the agreement of their creditors. But it didn’t go far enough because mortgage holders seldom agreed.
A 1934 law, the Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act, gave farmers a bypass. Even if the mortgage holder rejected an offer, foreclosure was stayed for five years, during which time the farmer could continue to occupy the land. Essentially, it allowed farmers to keep operating their farms and forced creditors — even mortgage holders — to wait.
The Supreme Court deemed this law unconstitutional because it went too far in depriving the mortgage holder of its property rights. Congress responded by reducing the stay to three years, among other tweaks. The court upheld the changed law.
Under the revised Frazier-Lemke Act, more farmers were able to get the relief they sought. But the most lasting effect of the court’s decision was that it set a precedent, allowing for additional relief to debtors through bankruptcy, even if the relief came at the expense of secured creditors like mortgage holders.
One of the first firms to take advantage of the Depression-era amendments to bankruptcy law was the Koplar Company of St. Louis. Koplar owned and operated apartment complexes and hotels, which were financed by mortgage bonds. During the Great Depression, its residential and retail tenants couldn’t make rent. Its hotel was empty.
Koplar tried to renegotiate with the mortgage bondholders, but these bondholders needed cash, too. Using the new bankruptcy law, Koplar was able to get new, more favorable terms on its mortgage bonds, keeping ownership of its buildings until economic conditions improved and tenants and guests could begin paying rent again.
The result illuminates the benefit of Congress making bankruptcy easier today: Koplar is still active in real estate in St. Louis, where it contributed to the revitalization projects in the once-blighted Central West End of the city, which now features a lively restaurant and bar scene. These are the businesses, with many jobs on the line during the pandemic, that Congress can help today by making reorganization in bankruptcy easier once again.
There is an additional reason for Congress to act: In matters of bankruptcy, states and localities are powerless to help businesses. The Constitution reserves the power to set bankruptcy law to Congress.
Adjusting the requirements to file a petition to reorganize business debts in bankruptcy should be a no brainer. It costs little now. It will have big trickle-down benefits if workers can return to their jobs because their employers are still in business. If workers have jobs to return to, it will help forestall a surge in personal bankruptcy later. Stimulus checks may keep households afloat for a month or two, but they won’t help for long, and they won’t help to preserve jobs or reduce pressure to collect debts that can swamp both individuals and businesses.
If Congress doesn’t act now to keep firms intact, eventually it will face making bankruptcy easier for households, too; this move, however, would be politically divisive and less effective than providing relief to businesses.
But by acting now, it can help ensure that more strong American businesses survive, helping owners, employees and consumers alike."
"April 24, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-the-gig-economy/2020/04/24/852023e4-8577-11ea-ae26-989cfce1c7c7_story.html,The Washington Post,Five myths about the gig economy,"Shelter-in-place orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic have increased public awareness and scrutiny of the gig economy — from the DoorDash drivers who drop off ramen, to the Instacart shoppers who buy groceries, to the Amazon Flex drivers who deliver packages. (Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) But many other kinds of laborers — including domestic and agricultural workers, temp agency workers, and freelancers — also piece together short-term jobs. Many are classified as independent contractors, which means they are not covered by laws that ensure a minimum wage, prohibit harassment or provide safety equipment. As millions of these workers stay on the job so others can stay home, here are five common myths about the gig economy.
Myth No. 1
The gig economy is taking over.
“The gig economy is coming for your job,” said a recent New York Times op-ed. One oft-cited 2017 study by Upwork and Freelancers Union predicts that the majority of the workforce will be freelancers by 2027.
The gig economy is here to stay, but it’s not replacing traditional work. While gig work is notoriously difficult to measure, most studies agree that about 10 percent of workers earn most of their income from the gig economy, a share that has remained stable for more than 20 years. At least as many workers engage in gig work on only a part-time basis, to supplement other income. Increasing numbers of workers have engaged in these “side hustles” in the past decade, with the most growth among those using online platforms such as Uber, Instacart, and TaskRabbit. The JPMorgan Chase Institute estimates that the fraction of U.S. households that earned money through an online platform in the previous year increased from 0.3 percent in 2013 to 1.6 percent in 2018. Many of these side hustlers become active on apps only after an income loss or an unexpected expense.
Myth No. 2
The gig economy has been driven by technology.
Technology “has created the digital gig economy,” according to the site TechNewsGadget. An International Labor Organization report on the gig economy asserts that “the development of newer technologies has brought fundamental changes to the way we work.” Just as the steam engine brought us industrial manufacturing, the story goes, smartphones brought us app-based work.
But the decisions of managers and policymakers shape the labor market more than technological development does. Beginning in the 1970s, corporations shifted their focus away from production and toward stock prices. Employees came to be seen as a cost to be cut rather than a source of profit. The use of temp agencies, introduced in the 1950s,, exploded in this era. With technology no more advanced than spreadsheets and land-line telephones, reliance on temp agencies continued into the 21st century, laying the foundations for today’s gig economy.
Shortly after after the Taft-Hartley Act, which passed in 1947, excluded independent contractors from the National Labor Relations Act, taxi companies began experimenting with hiring independent contractors instead of unionized employees. A series of court cases ruled in favor of this practice, opening the door for its proliferation. Uber and Lyft expanded the independent contractor model, taking advantage of a regulatory framework already in place. Technology can facilitate and accelerate change, but it doesn’t drive it.
Myth No. 3
Gig workers are mostly millennials.
Millennials are often thought to make up a large share of the gig economy. A recent Vox article repeated many assumptions about the age of gig workers: “A lot of millennials have been stuck in piecemeal or gig work with no real security.” According to a Deloitte report from 2018, “The gig economy is going strong, and millennials are leading the way.” It predicted that they would probably account for 42 percent of self-employed workers by 2020.
But the age distribution of gig workers is similar to that of the overall workforce, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The youngest workers, those under 25, are more likely to have gig jobs, because young people have always engaged in gig work. Students find jobs between semesters, and those just entering the labor market often take what work they can get as they search for more stable employment.
As a cohort, millennials tend to value job security — possibly because they came of age during the Great Recession — and are more likely than Generation X or baby boomers to say security is extremely important when considering a job, according to a Pew poll. Millennials also tend to hold jobs longer than the generation before them did at their age. These priorities make gig work unappealing to many millennials.
Myth No. 4
Gig work can be a backup option in a slow economy.
In the face of unprecedented unemployment, Fast Company encouraged people to “consider using freelance positions to gain experience and hourly gig jobs as a stopgap solution to paying your bills during a downturn.” MarketWatch suggested that “gig-economy jobs can earn you extra cash during the coronavirus pandemic.”
But gig work is not a reliable source of income during a recession. The number of jobs available depends on consumer demand: Though some companies, including the food delivery services Instacart and Postmates, have announced increases in work opportunities through their platforms, others, including Uber and Thumbtack, have reported steep drop-offs in demand since March, as consumers have stayed home. The dynamic pricing systems used by Uber, Lyft, and other platforms make not only job availability, but the rate of pay, unpredictable. Uber’s own research has suggested that if more drivers are active, jobs can be harder to find and earnings lower.
Short-term jobs, arranged through an app or not, allow companies to shift the financial risks of a tumultuous economy onto workers. During the Great Recession, temp jobs accounted for 11 percent of job losses, despite making up 2 percent of employment. Rather than providing a saving grace, gig work exacerbates the uncertainty workers face during a recession.
Myth No. 5
Gig workers have lots of flexibility.
Gig companies often describe a trade-off: What workers lack in stability, they make up for in flexibility. “Most drivers prefer freedom and flexibility to the forced schedules and rigid hourly shifts of traditional employment,” the chief executives of Uber and Lyft wrote in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed. Instacart has said that one of its goals is “to provide flexible earnings opportunities for shoppers.”
Not all gig work is created equal, though. Some contract work allows people to choose what they do, when they do it and what rates they charge: A freelance graphic designer with a respected portfolio, for example, may select her clients and set competitive rates. But several online platforms use variable pay, ratings systems and notifications to push people to accept certain jobs and work certain hours. These practices, called algorithmic management, limit the flexibility of work. Uber drivers report being monitored through their phones and deactivated without notice. Low, unpredictable wages and a lack of benefits can push people to work more hours than they would in a full-time job.
In fact, traditional employment can offer a schedule that’s both predictable and flexible, while gig workers can be given expanded benefits and protections. Major retailers, including Gap and Walmart, have introduced scheduling apps that give employees more control over their shifts. The National Domestic Workers Alliance has developed a platform for clients to contribute to workers’ benefits, increasing security for these gig workers. Flexibility does not have to come at the cost of job security and decent wages."

The Small Business Administration, in consultation with the Treasury Department, determined that because hedge funds are primarily engaged in speculative investments, the firms shouldn’t be entitled to Paycheck Protection Program loans. The prohibition also applies to private equity firms, according to guidance posted on Treasury’s website.
The Trump administration does not believe that Congress intended those types of businesses, which are generally ineligible for SBA loans under existing regulations, to qualify, according to the guidance. Concern that hedge funds might tap the PPP program amid the coronavirus crisis has triggered a backlash on Capitol Hill and around the country. Big hedge fund investors -- including state pension funds -- have issued stern warnings to the industry about seeking financing.
Congress this week passed a relief bill that President Donald Trump signed Friday that includes an additional $320 billion for the program, which provides loans of as much as $10 million for payroll costs and other expenses to keep workers on company payrolls amid state stay-at-home orders.
Returning Loans
The initial $349 billion appropriated for the program when it launched on April 3 ran out in just 13 days, after loans were approved for more than 1.6 million small businesses, according to the SBA.
Some public companies that reported receiving PPP loans, including Ruth’s Chris Steak House’s parent Ruth’s Hospitality Group Inc. and Shake Shack Inc., decided to return funds this week after facing criticism. It’s not clear whether hedge funds might have obtained loans because most aren’t publicly traded, meaning they don’t face the same disclosure obligations.
In early April, law firms began hosting Webinars and sending out alerts to explain to hedge funds how they might be able to access SBA loans. Accounting firms also reached out to funds to provide similar advice.
Fund Applications
Some hedge funds did apply, filling out forms attesting that they have fewer than 500 employees and certifying that the “current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations,” Bloomberg reported earlier this month.
Hedge funds are designed to employ as few people as possible so star traders don’t have to share the millions of dollars in fees they make off of their best market bets and for managing clients’ money.
In earlier guidance issued Thursday, Treasury and SBA responded to complaints that large, publicly traded companies and big chains were getting loans at the expense of smaller mom-and-pop shops. Those guidelines said companies seeking aid and those that have already gotten loans could be asked to prove they needed it because of the coronavirus outbreak. Companies were given until May 7 to return money without penalty.
Substantial Value
“It is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification,” the Thursday guidance said.
The guidance issued Friday also clarified other issues, including whether hospitals owned by governmental entities are eligible for a loan and what closing documents banks that are disbursing the funding should use. Confusion and uncertainty among lenders delayed the processing of some loans in the initial round of funding."

Biden said in an online fundraiser, “Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow.” As the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden surely knows that Trump cannot and will not delay the election. The election date is set in law; Trump cannot change it without Congress’s consent. The election itself is run by the states, not the federal government, so there’s no bureaucracy Trump could corral to implement any order delaying the vote. Such an order would surely be challenged in court, and it’s inconceivable that the Supreme Court would uphold such a blatantly unconstitutional act.
Nonetheless, Biden chose to taint the president essentially with a charge of treason. One would hope that this baseless statement could be excused as just another one of Biden’s increasingly frequent verbal hiccups. But Biden said other things Thursday night that show he believes Trump is a disloyal wannabe dictator.
Biden’s other stupendous fabrication concerned the U.S. Postal Service. The chronically mismanaged agency has been hemorrhaging billions of dollars for years and has been badly hit — as have all businesses — by the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats wanted to bail out the Postal Service in previous relief bills, but Trump has reportedly insisted on reforms to the entity’s business model as a condition for extra funding. That’s a reasonable demand, but Biden instead accused the president of trying to make it harder for people to vote by mail by defunding or otherwise hindering the Postal Service’s operations. There’s absolutely no proof Trump wants to do that, but that didn’t stop Biden.
Accusations such as these are a staple of the anti-Trump fever swamps. For them, it’s not enough to point out the president’s inarticulateness, crude language and lack of judgment. It’s not enough to call out the president when they disagree with Trump’s policies. Trump-haters make the president out to be evil and intent on destroying America.
This rhetoric is both unfounded and harmful to democracy. Trump has not done anything that a hopeful dictator would do, such as restrict press freedom, curtail political activity or arrest political opponents. Saying that he intends to do these things, however, makes anyone who supports him suspect. By falsely making this election a referendum on American democracy, advocates of these views attempt to portray Trump supporters and voters un-American.
One would hope that Biden himself doesn’t believe this, but this isn’t the first time Biden has crossed rhetorical lines during a campaign. He told a racially mixed audience in 2012 that Mitt Romney wanted to ""put y’all back in chains.” The remark was slammed by Republicans and defended by Democrats, but even an interpretation favorable to Biden suggests he’s willing to engage in divisive rhetoric to curry favor with potential voters. That’s dangerous to democracy in the current supercharged political environment.
The media cannot let this go. Serious reporters should ask Biden directly what basis he has to make such serious charges. Fact-checking entities should examine Biden’s statements and assess whether there is any evidence supporting them. If there is none, the media should push him to repudiate them.
Biden says he wants to heal and unify the country. That’s a noble aspiration, but he can’t unify a nation that he intentionally divides by accusing his political opponent of traitorous intent. Biden says he’s a better man than Trump. Comments such as these suggest that maybe he’s not."

Let us count the ways.,"ELECTIONS IN the United States have been thrown into disarray by a pandemic that makes packing into polling places a risk the country cannot afford to take. Why, some are asking, isn’t voting over the Internet the smartest option in the modern age?
Let us count the ways.
The greatest threat to democracy on Election Day is hacking, and cybersecurity experts have long agreed that the intelligent response is to take as much cyber out of the security equation as possible. Pen-and-paper ballots let officials count hard copies and compare them with electronic tallies after the fact. Critical infrastructure that’s disconnected from the Web keeps systems further from adversaries’ reach. Putting voting online, of course, follows the precise opposite of this advice.
An Internet election presents plenty of penetration points for an enemy to attack. Election officials must figure out how to ensure the security of individuals’ personal devices (many of which are already infected by some sort of malware) as well as how to keep remote adversaries away from a server that’s necessarily connected to the Web. Then there’s the trouble of guaranteeing that voters are who they say they are. This task is easier for, say, the Estonian e-government, which issues ID smart cards with advanced authentication capabilities to every citizen — but researchers say even that nation’s vaunted I-voting system is all too vulnerable.
The auditing that’s the fail-safe for imperfect cybersecurity falls apart in Web voting, too. The secret ballot makes it impossible to create for elections the equivalent of banking’s double ledger. There’s no posting votes on a government portal for verification, or emailing voters their submission back, because the separation between vote and voter is sacrosanct. Academics have been investigating the possibility of a cryptographic solution to this problem, but it’s several years away from being ready for prime time — not several months, and certainly not several weeks.
Technology promises to play an important part in making sure there’s a vote this fall and making sure that vote is open to all Americans. Expanding online registration to the entire population was a good idea before the coronavirus hit and is a fundamental one now. But by scrambling to surmount the obstacles an Internet election presents, the country would trade out the risk of infection at polling places for the risk of interference at the virtual ballot box. In a crisis, voting by mail remains the far safer option."
"April 25, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/big-banks-ready-to-flood-the-zone-with-new-applications-for-sba-loans/2020/04/22/8846d10c-84c9-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,The Washington Post,Big Banks Ready to Flood the Zone With New Applications for SBA Loans,"Big U.S. banks are preparing to flood loan applications into the government’s emergency financing program for small businesses the moment Congress replenishes it with $320 billion in additional funding. Packets ready to go at just a few of the largest firms stretch into the tens of billions of dollars.
The pressure is particularly high on Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. after they lagged behind smaller rivals in helping legions of business customers tap the Paycheck Protection Program’s initial $349 billion in funding. Bank of America had arranged roughly $5 billion when the initial funding was depleted last week, according to people with knowledge of the matter, ranking below smaller rivals including Truist Financial Corp. and PNC Financial Services Inc. Wells Fargo organized a mere $120 million.
The firms, which have said they sought clarity on rules from the Small Business Administration, have since faced withering criticism from longtime clients who tried in vain to get applications processed to weather the coronavirus pandemic. Many have flocked to social media, recounting that bankers advised them to try community banks instead. Some have sued.
“It’s definitely not a good look for the big banks,” said Ian Katz, an analyst with Capital Alpha Partners in Washington. “The second time around, they should have a better feel for how to deal with it.”
JPMorgan Chase & Co. arranged more loans than any other firm in the first round, about $14 billion, but a number of regional and community banks punched far above their weight in the chaotic rush for a lifeline earlier this month. Some smaller banks said afterward that they deployed hundreds of employees to manually enter paperwork, while larger lenders paused to get clarity on rules and spent days trying to automate the process.
Now, some of those efforts may give giant banks an edge in the second round.
Wells Fargo assigned thousands of people to process customer paperwork and set up software to speed submissions to the SBA, according to a person briefed on its preparations. Wells Fargo said last week it invited more than 450,000 customers to apply for a total of about $50 billion of financing, “which we stand ready to submit.”
Still, the system will depend in part on interacting with the SBA’s platform known as E-Tran, which froze intermittently during the first round of the massive program. Some lawmakers have expressed concern it won’t be able to handle the deluge once the program reopens, and some bank executives have doubts about how much of their pipelines they’ll be able to get through before the funds run out a second time.
Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said Wednesday that his firm has received 390,000 applications seeking a total of more than $50 billion in SBA loans, and has continued to process them since the first round of funding ran out. The bank has had about 8,000 people involved in handling application packets, according to spokesman Bill Halldin.
“Even if Congress completes the additional funding, it may not be enough to fill the demands,” Moynihan said. “But we’re ready to go.”
JPMorgan has fully processed more than 115,000 applications, totaling around $13 billion, which it can submit as soon as the program reopens, a spokesperson for the company said Wednesday. In the first round of funding, the bank’s commercial customers had a much higher success rate than smaller clients in getting financing. Since then, the lender has had thousands of people verifying payroll information and working with clients to correct errors, the most time-intensive parts of the process.
The next round of funding includes a $60 billion carve-out for small lenders. That was important for Congress to do because while community banks participated early and more aggressively in the first round than some larger banks, they’ll be competing this time with large banks fully active, said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America.
“Now that the program’s been up and running, the largest lenders with armies of loan officers can dominate the funding,” Merski said."
"April 25, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazils-justice-minister-resigns-accusing-bolsonoro-of-improper-conduct/2020/04/24/53f4b804-8642-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,The Washington Post,"Brazil’s justice minister resigns, accusing Bolsonaro of improper conduct","RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilian Justice Minister Sérgio Moro, who shepherded the sprawling corruption probe that imprisoned some of Latin America's most influential people, resigned in protest Friday after President Jair Bolsonaro fired his police chief.
In an extraordinary resignation speech, Moro charged that Bolsonaro was trying to improperly politicize the Justice Ministry. The move sent political shock waves through Latin America’s largest country as it grapples with the worst public health crisis in a lifetime.
Moro said he could discern only political and improper motives behind Bolsonaro’s decision to fire Maurício Valeixo, the head of the federal police. He accused Bolsonaro of wanting to install a police chief who would grant him access to confidential reports and take investigative requests, jeopardizing the agency’s political independence.
“That really isn’t the role of the federal police to serve this kind of information,” Moro said.
The political drama rapidly evolved throughout Friday. The Brazilian attorney general called for an inquiry into the accusations. Then Bolsonaro denied any misconduct in a lengthy and unfocused speech. And finally, a nightly news program aired messages leaked by Moro that appeared to undercut Bolsonaro’s rebuttals.
Bolsonaro had said he hadn’t tried to interfere with the federal police, but WhatsApp messages aired by the news show National Journal appeared to show Bolsonaro urging the removal of Valeixo because of investigations into his supporters. “Another reason for the removal,” Bolsonaro allegedly said on Thursday in a message to Moro.
Brazilian attorney general Augusto Aras said Moro’s allegations, if true, “would reveal the practice of illegal actions.”
The resignation deprived Bolsonaro of one of his most crucial and popular allies, further isolating him as he comes under criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
It also illustrated how quickly the political landscape has shifted in Brazil since the arrival of the pandemic.
Bolsonaro has repeatedly minimized the disease, calling it “a little flu” that doesn’t warrant closing businesses, shuttering schools and national isolation. His positioning — which he’s maintained even with more than 3,400 dead and 51,000 infected — has put him at odds with many of his political allies and most of the Brazilian population.
Governors who once supported him have called his behavior reckless. Angry Brazilians are banging pots outside their windows and calling for his removal.
And in perhaps the biggest political blow, the country’s hugely popular health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta — whose sober, technocratic daily news conferences calmed many anxious Brazilians — was fired by Bolsonaro last week after he repeatedly and publicly contradicted the president on the severity of the crisis.
Meanwhile, investigators are pursuing corruption investigations into those closest to Bolsonaro, including his son Flavio, a federal senator.
“He’s been weakened by his handling of the pandemic,” said Matias Spektor, an associate ­professor of international relations at Fundação Getúlio Vargas in São Paulo. “He has lost a significant amount of support, and he feels it. He feels the investigations closing in on ­family members. So he has sacked the head of the military police, and he’s not in a good place.”
To many here, Moro has been less a cabinet member than a national icon. At political rallies, his features have been super­imposed onto giant Superman ­balloons. At supermarkets, he has been cheered. In a country perennially hobbled by corruption, he was a figure who for many represented a new, better Brazil.
His legend was cultivated while he was a judge, overseeing the Lava Jato corruption probe. It led to the convictions of some of Latin America’s most powerful political figures, including former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The removal of Lula, who had been leading in the presidential opinion polls, effectively cleared the path for Bolsonaro to the presidency. Bolsonaro then appointed Moro as his justice minister.
Moro’s resignation and remarks Friday are sure to inflame fears of authoritarian tendencies in Bolsonaro, a former army officer who rose to power lamenting the collapse of Brazil’s military dictatorship and, just days ago, joined a rally in Brasília where protesters called for its return.
In a freewheeling national address late Friday afternoon, Bolsonaro denied he had acted improperly. He said that he didn’t need anyone’s permission to fire someone — and that he had never asked the federal police to protect him from investigations. Moro’s allegations, he said, had left him heartsick.
“I always opened my heart to him,” Bolsonaro said. “And I doubt if he ever opened his for me.”
Moro said he explained to Bolsonaro that his removal of the police chief, who was overseeing the investigations into his family, would be seen as improper. “There was this insistence from the president,” he said. “I told him that this would be political interference, and he said that it would be.”
Opposition lawmakers immediately seized on the comments — and called on Moro to testify publicly.
“Moro imploded the Bolsonaro government,” Marcelo Freixo, an opposition lawmaker, wrote on Twitter. “It affirmed that the president wants to control the police to grant criminal impunity to his family and to attack democracy.”"

Now, it’s all Zoom calls and appearances from his basement.","A year ago, Joe Biden announced he was running for president by video, joining a Democratic field so crowded it would be banned from meeting by today’s social distancing rules.
Then he rode an Amtrak train from Washington, D.C., to Wilmington, Del.
Once he arrived, he stopped at Gianni’s Pizza, shook hands with friends and fielded questions from reporters, who crowded so tightly that he joked that someone might get hit as he tried to drive away.
A year later, the Acela isn’t running. Much of Amtrak’s ordinary service isn’t, either. Gianni’s is open only for takeout. And Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, spends his days mostly inside his home.
“Here we are, doing a virtual campaign, which has never been done before,” said South Carolina state Sen. Dick Harpootlian (D), a longtime friend of Biden’s who pushed him to enter the race. Harpootlian said he’s been hosting fundraisers, knocking on doors and attending rallies for presidential candidates for decades.
“Those are the mechanisms that I’m used to, that I grew up with, if you will,” he said. “And many of those mechanisms are out the window.”
To mark the anniversary of his campaign, Biden can’t celebrate with a rally. His team can’t open new offices and collect names and addresses of supporters.
Instead, staffers learned to sew masks for distribution to those who need them most. That work is part of an effort to focus on the front-line health-care workers and first responders who have put themselves in danger as the novel coronavirus has ravaged the country.
Biden’s advance team made calls to thank nurses and first responders. And some called to check on their contacts in communities — not asking for their votes but inquiring whether they needed help.
Biden also has been making calls to first responders. On Friday, he held a 30-minute Zoom call with a nurse in Wisconsin. When the call ended, Biden decided to call her family too.
Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said Biden’s message hasn’t changed. “One year ago, Vice President Biden said we are in a battle for the soul of America,” she said. “As we watch Donald Trump consistently put his own politics first amidst a global pandemic and an economic crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in a generation, that’s even truer today.”
But nearly everything else has changed.
Take fundraising. Former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, who hosted Biden’s first fundraising event as a presidential candidate last year, recalled a room that was packed with donors. Now Biden hosts Zoom calls — and the vibe is a little different. One potential donor called in to a recent event from his treadmill.
When Biden entered the presidential race, the field was crowded — and competitive. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was raising millions from grass-roots donors. The campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was on the rise. Pete Buttigieg was still the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and beginning to register in the polls. He went on to win the Iowa caucuses.
Now they’re — mostly — singing new tunes.
“A year ago, Joe Biden announced his campaign based on a belief that we’re in a battle for the soul of the nation,” Buttigieg said in a video he posted to Twitter on Saturday to support Biden’s efforts. “I don’t have to tell you that a lot has changed since then.”
“I’m joining @JoeBiden and thanking our essential workers,” wrote Warren in a social media post, adding her voice to chorus of defeated rivals following the campaign’s lead.
Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), along with former congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas, also posted supportive #SoulSaturday messages for Biden.
Some dynamics do not shift so quickly. Though Sanders has endorsed Biden, he did not take to Twitter to celebrate the anniversary until Saturday evening, after a Washington Post reporter asked about the omission.
Biden’s allies say the biggest difference between now and a year ago is the importance of the election.
“The world’s changed,” said Harpootlian. “Campaigns have changed. This campaign has changed. But the stakes could have never been higher. We wanted to win a year ago. But there is a scenario, a year ago, where, maybe we don’t pull it off. But the stakes have become so much higher now that that is not an option.”
But they acknowledge that the new normal hides Biden’s strength as a retail campaigner.
“I think that hampers a guy like Joe Biden, who look, he’s best one-on-one,” Harpootlian said. “He’s best speaking to a crowd of 10,000. He’s best letting people feel that honesty and sincerity. It’s hard to do that on a Zoom call.”
But, Harpootlian noted: The field is level. President Trump too must forgo his famous rallies.
“It’s a detriment to both him and Trump,” said Rendell.
Biden, he said, gets his energy from being with people. Zoom meetings can come close to replicating that feel — but not entirely, he said.
“It’s not the same,” said Rendell. “It’s not the same for someone who has got tremendous personal warmth, which Biden has.”
And when Biden launched a year ago, The Washington Post’s newsroom was chock-full of people. When this reporter stopped in Saturday to pick up supplies at her desk, she stood in a room that was completely empty."
"April 26, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/one-tiny-manufacturers-struggle-shows-just-how-difficult-reopening-the-economy-will-be/2020/04/24/e3baf250-861a-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,The Washington Post,One Tiny Manufacturer’s Struggle Shows Just How Difficult Reopening the Economy Will Be,"Five minutes into a video conference with his management team about who to lay off at his auto-parts company, Jeff Aznavorian got good news.
His banker was calling: Aznavorian still had a shot at a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program for businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. Employees of his third-generation company, Clips & Clamps Industries, might be spared.
But getting cash is just one of the many hurdles Aznavorian has to overcome as Detroit’s automakers prepare to restart production after weeks of shutdowns. He needs hundreds of masks. Cleaning supplies are scarce. Customers are bombarding him with emails about how he’ll prevent the virus’s spread among his 52 workers.
“It’s got me nervous about going back to work, but we’ve got to do it somehow,” said Aznavorian, 46. “If we don’t, there won’t be a company to support those people anymore.”
The global auto industry is going through the biggest disruption since at least World War II, and in order to recover from the billions in lost sales and profit triggered by the economic shutdown, it needs every link in the supply chain to survive, right down to a small metal-forming company about 30 miles west of Detroit.
Manufacturers have a lot more to worry about than just making parts. To avoid spread of the disease, factories have got to be spotless, and workers under constant medical surveillance. There’s a patchwork of state and local quarantine orders to abide by, and an intricate supply chain to navigate in order to ship the roughly 30,000 components that go into a vehicle.
That’s a daunting challenge for an already stressed global auto industry, but it’s even tougher for a tiny business like Clips & Clamps.“Smaller companies don’t have big balance sheets and a lot of working capital, and they’re pretty lean in terms of their ability to absorb these kinds of shocks,” said Razat Gaurav, chief executive officer of Llamasoft, a supply-chain analytics company.
Bleach, Thermometers
Clips & Clamps was still recovering from price shocks triggered by U.S. steel tariffs. Now, a financial hit is just one of many ways Aznavorian’s business in Plymouth, Michigan, has been upended.
In non-pandemic times, he’s usually out of the house by 7 a.m., driving his black Ram 1500 pickup truck the three miles to Clips & Clamps. But the factory shut on March 23, the day Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer had ordered all non-essential businesses in the state to close. On Friday, she extended the order to May 15 and left carmakers and their suppliers in limbo as to whether the longer shutdown applies to them.
These days, Aznavorian is conducting business from home in sweatpants, wearing a baseball cap to hide his overgrown hair, and noise-canceling headphones in case his son wants to practice the French horn or his daughter the flute.
He spends his time churning through a mountain of emails, tuning into webinars to try and estimate just how low North American auto production will go this year -- 12.7 million units is the best-case scenario, a 20% drop -- and comparing notes with peers from his industry trade group on how to keep a plant hygienic enough to operate during a pandemic. Snaring precious supplies and the personal protective equipment everyone is clamoring for isn’t easy.
Aznavorian sent his maintenance team to Home Depot to buy cleaning agents as soon as the shutdown was announced, but all that was left was bleach. Purell refills are on indefinite back order.He ordered between 600 to 800 surgical masks from three different companies, including a vendor who usually sells him cardboard boxes, in the hopes at least some will arrive by next week -- but that’s in question. He found two non-contact infrared temperature guns online at Walmart, for $81.99 a pop.
Those safety measures are becoming more crucial. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Clips & Clamps’s biggest customer, plans to progressively restart beginning May 4, pending approval from governments and unions. Whitmer, under pressure from protesters to reopen the state’s economy, said Wednesday she’s closely monitoring talks between carmakers and the United Auto Workers union on new safety protocols to let them “slowly re-engage in a safe manner.”
‘Back Up!’
Aznavorian’s design and tooling teams are making brass rings -- he calls them knuckle extenders -- so workers can open doors or press buttons without having to touch them. Still, he frets over whether his staff will adhere to social distancing. During a recent factory visit to check on a small production run, he snapped after encountering two employees chatting about 5 and a half feet apart.“My first word to him was, ‘Jeff back up!’” he said of the employee. “They’re so used to doing that -- it’s hard to change.”Beyond keeping workers safe, Aznavorian needs to make sure he can pay them. As March was ending, the company was closing out a record fiscal year of sales -- $15 million – and “decent” profitability, Aznavorian said. But after a month of nearly zero revenue, securing the PPP loan was critical.
The call from his banker last week provided much-needed relief, since he initially missed the cutoff due to an IT glitch at his bank. After a mad rush -- including 45 minutes spent on a meeting app helping his tech-challenged parents and aunt, who are co-owners in the company, to e-sign the application -- Aznavorian got what he calls “the golden ticket:” an e-transaction number from the Small Business Administration.
More than $500,000 landed in his bank account this week. But with auto production a long ways from returning to normal levels, he’s not out of the woods.
“There are tons of hard choices we’re going to have to make over the next weeks and months,” he said. “But it gives us breathing room to make those decisions.”"
"April 26, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/mnuchin-says-rising-budget-deficits-to-be-a-focus-over-time/2020/04/26/b0d85ea2-87c5-11ea-80df-d24b35a568ae_story.html,The Washington Post,Mnuchin Says Rising Budget Deficits to Be Focus ‘Over Time’,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that “over time” the U.S. will need to look into the sharply rising budget deficits created by the multi-trillion-dollar coronavirus support packages.
Right now “we’re in a war,” Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We’re going to do whatever we need” to support the economy.
The good news, Mnuchin said, is that “interest rates are extremely low and we’re locking in long-term rates” at those levels.
And he predicted the economy would “really bounce back in July, August and September” as the closures related to stopping the spread of Covid-19 recede.
The federal government’s stimulus package aimed at containing the economic hit of coronavirus is set to expand the budget deficit by $1.6 trillion this fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Overall, that would send the shortfall to a record $3.7 trillion for the period, as the economy contracts and spending soars. The deficit would be the equivalent of about 18% of GDP, the highest since World War II.
The pandemic forced a sudden stop in the U.S. economy, with an unprecedented hit: the country’s GDP likely shrank 3.9% in the first quarter on an annualized basis, the steepest since 2009, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. And in the second quarter, that worsens: some economists see as much as a 40% contraction, the most in recorded data that goes back to the 1940s.
Hawks Concerned
While deficit hawks worry high debt could risk U.S. credit quality, interest rates remain low and investor appetite remains. The benchmark 10-year note yielded 0.6% on Friday, compared to 2.5% a year ago.
Kevin Hassett, a senior White House economic adviser and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, also talked about skyrocketing federal debt in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.”
“The debt level in the U.S. has climbed up to the point where, in the economics literature, we see, that it can be a sort of long-run negative for growth,” Hassett said. “As we go into the next phase of legislation we need to think about long-run things that we can do to try to get ahead of the curve on debt.”
Treasury and the Small Business Administration are preparing to roll out a second tranche of the Paycheck Protection Program, designed by Congress to help small businesses get through Covid-19-related shutdowns.
Mnuchin said he was confident that the average loan size would be smaller than in the first round, when funds ran out in less than two weeks and several larger, publicly traded companies -- including national restaurant and hotel chains -- obtained loans.
Many banks and businesses also complained about glitches that prevented them from issuing or applying for loans in the first round.
“I think you’re going to see this move in the right direction and I think you’re going to also see in this round the average loan size go down significantly,” Mnuchin said.
The first round of PPP loans “impacted about 30 million workers. I think this round will be about the same. That will be close to 50% of the private workforce,” Mnuchin said. “So I actually hope we run out of money quickly so we can get the money into the workers’ pockets.”"

After three inconclusive Israeli elections, long-serving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief opponent, Benny Gantz, finally agreed last Monday to form a government together, citing the urgent need to face the covid-19 pandemic. The deal stipulates that the coalition will focus exclusively on fighting the coronavirus for its first six months. But there is one huge exception: Starting July 1, Netanyahu, who will remain prime minister, will be allowed to seek a vote by his cabinet or the parliament on Israel’s annexation of more than 30 percent of the West Bank, where the majority of the would-be Palestinian state’s population lives.
There’s only one condition: Netanyahu must act in “full agreement with the United States.” In other words, Trump will have the power to decide whether his Israeli ally can proceed with a vote he would very likely win and that would forever alter Israel’s character.
That provision was a huge victory for Netanyahu, who promised before the last election in March that he would pursue the annexation of all 128 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, along with the Jordan Valley along the border with Jordan. In theory, the land grab is legitimized by the Middle East “peace plan” Trump released in January, which calls for the creation of a weak Palestinian state on the chopped-up remains of the territory.
In practice, if Israeli annexation goes forward without Palestinian or Arab agreement, it will not only kill Trump’s plan; it will make a two-state settlement impossible. If there is no Palestine, Israel will be doomed to become a binational state rather than a Jewish one, or else adopt an apartheid system in which millions of Palestinians are ruled by Israel but lack full political rights.
This is not the view of the hard-line activists who campaign for BDS — the boycott, divestment and sanction movement. It is the judgment of some of the most pro-Israel members of Congress and policy experts in Washington.
Typical was a statement last week by the centrist Israel Policy Forum, which welcomed the new government but urged it to heed “warnings against unilateral annexation that have come from Israeli security experts, the United States Congress, the European Union, foreign policy experts, and American Jewish leaders.”
Netanyahu isn’t listening. According to David Makovsky, a former State Department analyst now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Netanyahu perceives a “historic opportunity to fulfill long-term territorial goals.” It’s probably for that reason that he agreed to the new government; it’s certainly the cause of his insistence on the July 1 date, which, Makovsky points out, hedges against the risk that Trump will lose the presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, who would certainly oppose annexation.
So will Trump deliver the green light Netanyahu needs? There’s plenty of reason to suppose that he will. Trump has already granted the Israeli leader a string of unprecedented concessions, including recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, without regard for the geopolitical consequences.
Trump’s motivation is transparent: In this election year, he wishes to galvanize the evangelical Christians and minority of U.S. Jews who support a “greater Israel,” while casting Democrats who disagree as anti-Zionist. The long-term impact on Israel, or Israel’s relations with the United States, doesn’t interest him.
And yet: Gantz may have had some cause in insisting that Netanyahu agree to obtain the United States’ “full agreement.” Netanyahu was about to proceed with the settlements’ annexation in early February when he was blocked by Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner, a prime author of the peace plan. The White House said annexation must await U.S.-Israeli agreement on a map of the exact boundaries of the seizure.
Kushner is no doubt aware that unilateral annexation will tank the plan on which he labored for the better part of three years. And Trump will likely be hearing in the coming weeks from key Arab allies — Jordan, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia — who will tell him the action will doom the alliance between Israel and Arab states that Trump hopes to foster.
A lot of Middle East hands are hoping that Trump will limit Netanyahu to a partial action — say, the annexation of only those West Bank settlements near Israel’s border. They might be encouraged by the Delphic statement delivered Wednesday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said annexation was “an Israeli decision,” but added, “we’ll work closely with them to share our views of this in a private setting.”
The public Trump will surely pose as Israel’s champion. The question is whether, in private, he will make an effort to save the Jewish state from Netanyahu’s reckless bid for a territorial legacy."

Period. He long ago lost that right, but his suggestion on Thursday that taking a “disinfectant . . . by injection” might be a way to fight the coronavirus virus should be the last straw for everyone.
The petrifying absurdity of this presidency was brought home when the company that owns Lysol had to issue a statement on Friday declaring that “under no circumstance” should its products be ingested or injected. You think? Only Trump could make such a statement necessary.
Underscoring the reality that Trump is a clear and present danger to public health, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning on Friday that taking chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — the drugs Trump and his Fox News friends promoted relentlessly for weeks as a magical cure for covid-19 — could cause “serious poisoning and death” taken outside a hospital or formal clinical trial. The only reason an agency of the government that Trump theoretically leads had to do this was Trump’s demented recklessness.
Let’s turn the corner this week.
First, as hard as it might be, the media needs to put the equivalent of a consumer warning on all coverage of Trump, who spent part of his Sunday afternoon rage-tweeting against the press. He has squandered the privilege of being covered as a normal president would, and both the tone and the content of mainstream reporting must change to reflect this. It would make this easier if Republicans decided they do not want to be the party of Clorox chewables. Will they finally disown Trump in large numbers? Don’t bet your next load of laundry.
Second, let’s have a bipartisan coalition of responsible governors pick one of their own to lead a daily briefing aimed at the whole country. Many governors already make regular reports to their respective states, of course, and New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo has played a de facto role as a spokesman with effective news conferences well-timed for East Coast media.
But individual governors often and understandably hedge what they say for fear of retaliation by Trump, who treats them the same way he treated Ukraine’s president. He is, once again, holding Washington’s assistance hostage to his own selfish interests.
Workers realized long ago that speaking and bargaining collectively gave them power they didn’t have as individuals. Governors trying to act sensibly should learn the same lesson. Acting together, they could be far more fearless in calling out Trump’s failures, and more demanding when it comes to what their citizens need from Washington.
With his hands full in New York, Cuomo will continue his own briefings. But other governors could rotate the job of being the daily embodiment of practical ideas and thoughtful leadership.
Americans across the country need to hear more from Republican governors such as Maryland’s Larry Hogan, Ohio’s Mike DeWine and Massachusetts’s Charlie Baker. And let Western and Midwestern Democratic governors become larger national voices, among them California’s Gavin Newsom, Oregon’s Kate Brown, Washington’s Jay Inslee, Colorado’s Jared Polis, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois’s J.B. Pritzker. Others could join. Each day, one of them should be empowered by their colleagues to speak for the group. They should do this even if Trump — no doubt influenced by the backlash against his Disinfectant Delirium — follows through on his Saturday evening tweet suggesting he might end his daily follies.
Third, Congress should face the fact that it may get only one more shot at a big relief bill. This one needs to include the essentials but is also the opportunity to consider a more far-reaching approach to mitigation and recovery.
These essentials include large-scale assistance to state and local governments, food stamp increases, a U.S. Postal Service rescue and a plan to get health coverage to everyone for at least the duration of the pandemic. Other must-haves: Whatever additional money is needed for an effective national testing program and to give every American the option to vote by mail in November.
But rapidly mounting unemployment makes proposals for direct federal funding of company payrolls, up to certain limits, more attractive than ever. Paycheck guarantees of this sort have been put into effect in Denmark, Germany and Britain. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, about as moderate and pro-capitalist a Democrat as you’ll find, has offered a bill along these lines with the unlikely trio of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has been pushing his own version of the idea, as has Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). It’s a big concept, and it wouldn’t be cheap. But it may well be simpler to administer and execute than the helter-skelter business rescue programs now in place.
A reader might point out that all three of these ideas would shift as much influence and responsibility away from Trump as possible. Such a reader would be very perceptive."

We believe that tomorrow ought to be better than today, just as today was better than yesterday. This optimism, in part, defines us as a people. We assume that progress is the natural order of things. Problems are meant to be solved. History is an upward curve of well-being. But what if all this is a fantasy that, ironically, exposes us to more social and economic disruption?
So it seems.
If you look back on recent history, our most powerful disruptions shared one characteristic: They were not widely foreseen. This was true of the terrorism of 9/11; the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the parallel Great Recession; and now the coronavirus pandemic — with all its destructive side effects on public health, the economy and our national psyche.
In each case, there was a failure of imagination, as Tom Friedman has noted. Warnings found little receptiveness among the public or government officials. We didn’t think what happened could happen. The presumption of progress bred complacency. To emphasize: There was a failure of imagination in each case.
We couldn’t imagine hijacked passenger jets smashing into the twin towers. We couldn’t imagine a global financial crisis because nothing like it had happened since the 1930s. We had learned the lessons of the Great Depression and could prevent a repetition, it was said. The same seemed true of pandemics. After all, we had developed a vaccine against Ebola, which demonstrated our capacity to repel viral threats, or so it appeared. We fooled ourselves into thinking we had engineered permanent improvements in our social and economic systems.
To be fair, progress as it’s commonly understood — higher living standards — has not been at a standstill. Many advances have made life better. Without antibiotics and other modern pharmaceuticals, the world would be a more dangerous and dispiriting place. The adoption of modern technology has enabled hundreds of millions of people around the world to escape crushing poverty. The expansion of the welfare state (what Americans call the “safety net”) has made contemporary capitalism less harsh.
Still, the setbacks loom ever larger. Our governmental debt is high, and economic stability is low. Many of the claims of progress turn out to be exaggerated, superficial, delusional or unattainable, as the historian Richard Hofstadter pointed out in his 1955 book, “The Age of Reform.”
“We go off on periodic psychic sprees that purport to be moral crusades . . . [to] restore absolute popular democracy or completely honest competition in business,” he wrote. “Very often the evils they are troubled about do exist in some form, usually something can be done about them.” But the pursuit of progress “often wanders over the border between reality and impossibility.”
What we should have learned by now is that progress is often grudging, incomplete or contradictory. In its American version, much was expected of both strong economic growth and technological gains. But the lesson of both economic growth and technologies is that they are double-edged swords and must be judged as such.
Sure, the Internet enables marvelous things. But it also imposes huge costs on society: intrusions in people’s privacy; the theft of valuable business and governmental records; and — most important — the transformation of warfare as combatants strive to destroy each other’s cyber networks and create widespread social and economic chaos.
Global warming is another example. It is largely a result of the burning of fossil fuels, which has been the engine of our progress. Now, it is anti-progress. The point here is not that technologies are good or bad but that they have uneven consequences that should be better understood, if and when they are deployed. Similar inconsistencies and ambiguities attach to economic growth. It raises some up and pushes others down.
What connects these various problems is the belief that the future can be orchestrated. The reality is that our control over the future is modest at best, nonexistent at worst. We react more to events than lead them.
We worship at the altar of progress without adequately acknowledging its limits. Despite its seductive rhetoric, it is hardly a panacea. This does not mean that we should repudiate the effort to make things better. But it does mean that we should be more candid about what is possible. If not, we might yet again wander over the “border between reality and impossibility.”"
"April 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/sba-sets-cap-on-amount-of-relief-loans-that-banks-can-process/2020/04/26/55632164-8807-11ea-80df-d24b35a568ae_story.html,The Washington Post,SBA Sets Cap on Amount of Relief Loans That Banks Can Process,"The U.S. Small Business Administration is capping the value of loans individual banks can arrange under a government economic relief program for small businesses that restarts Monday.
The move reflects concerns that the biggest U.S. banks could again dominate the lending and prevent money from getting to the mom-and-pop shops that need it the most.
The SBA sent an email to lenders on Sunday limiting the maximum dollar amount of loans each bank can issue at 10% of funding authority of the Paycheck Protection Program. The goal of the cap is “to ensure equitable access,” according to a copy of the email seen by Bloomberg News.
It wasn’t clear from the email what the dollar amount of the cap would be. Last week Congress added $320 billion to the program, including $10 billion for bank processing fees. It also earmarked $60 billion of the total for small lenders. The SBA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The program, which relaunches Monday after the initial funding of $349 billion ran out in just 13 days, allows for loans of as much as $10 million per borrower and is meant to help small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic keep workers on their payrolls.
The rollout of the program caused an uproar when it emerged that big national chains including Potbelly Corp. and the operator of Ruth’s Chris steak houses landed $10 million or more apiece in loans thanks to a loophole, while millions of very small businesses were left stranded when the program ran out of money.
Advocates for small businesses are concerned the additional funding could also be exhausted in a matter of days, won’t be enough to meet demand, and might not reach the entities that need it the most. Applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis -- a procedure criticized on Sunday by Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan.
The largest U.S. lenders have been preparing a barrage of loan applications since the first round of the program ended April 16. JPMorgan Chase & Co., which arranged the most loans in the first round at $14 billion, had fully processed about $13 billion or more as of Wednesday. Wells Fargo & Co. has said it invited more than 450,000 customers to apply for a total of about $50 billion of financing, after arranging a mere $120 million in the first round.
“We have mobilized thousands of employees and launched new technology to assist customers seeking access to the PPP,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kate Pulley said in a statement.
Bank of America has about $50 billion worth of requests, Moynihan reiterated Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” The firm had only arranged roughly $5 billion when the initial funding was depleted, people with knowledge of the matter have said.
The Independent Community Bankers of America supports the change to ensure available funding is spread among the more than 5,000 lenders approved to participate in the program, said Paul Merski, who oversees the group’s work with Congress.
The changes SBA announced on Sunday also include allowing lenders to send at least 15,000 applications in one batch to help pace the processing of loans. The agency’s E-Tran system was overwhelmed by the volume during the initial round and was often inaccessible, delaying the processing of some loans."

The Fed said on Thursday that it will publish the names and details of participants in its facilities set up in the CARES Act, as well as the amounts that were borrowed and the interest rate charged on its website at least every 30 days. It will also report the overall costs, revenues and fees of each of the facilities.
“The Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and accountability by providing the public and Congress detailed information about our actions to support the economy during this difficult time,” Chairman Jerome Powell said in a statement.
The central bank won’t immediately disclose borrowers in three programs linked to short-term funding programs instituted before the Cares Act to help stem the economic crisis from the outbreak.
Lawmakers from both parties had been pressing the Fed to spell out which companies were getting assistance, in an effort to make sure that taxpayer money was going where it was intended. There has also been growing public frustration that small businesses had been beaten to funds by bigger companies with better access to banks and lawyers. Congress is debating another multi-billion dollar spending package to re-start that program, which is not being run by the Fed.
‘Significant Victory’
“This is a significant victory for the public,” tweeted Bharat Ramamurti, a member of the Congressional watchdog appointed to scrutinize implementation of the Fed and Treasury’s virus-relief work. “We will need to look carefully at the first report to see if other information is needed but this is a very good step.”
As part of the Cares Act signed into law late last month, the Fed established programs aimed at lending to small and mid-size businesses, states and municipalities. Several of those six facilities are not yet up and running.
It will not apply the same disclosure terms to the three Fed facilities launched prior to the passage of the Cares Act -- the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility and the Commercial Paper Funding Facility -- which collectively have lent out more than $80 billion as of April 22, the latest date for which data is available.
Congress appropriated $454 billion in the Cares Act to support lending efforts by the central bank that can be leveraged into trillions of dollars of credit. The Fed is setting up its emergency programs under Section 13-3 of the Federal Reserve Act, which outlines rules for disclosure of loan details to Congress.
Stigma Risk
The Fed did not disclose individual borrower details in its facilities following the 2008 financial crisis until it was forced to do so by the courts after a lawsuit brought by Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News. Its reluctance to make such information public stems from the concern that it may incite market panic or disincentivize borrowers from taking advantage of the programs for fear of resulting stigma.
“If the threshold for them is that they won’t take the money if people know they took the money, then it seems like they don’t need the money,” Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, said before the Fed’s announcement.
The PDCF loans to U.S. government bond dealers. The MMMLF is working with banks to help money funds meet redemption demands. The CPFF is directly financing the short-term IOUs of U.S. corporations. The Fed regards the markets around these programs as systemically critical to financial stability.
Powell will request confidentiality for those three when he submits information to Congress and the Fed will eventually disclose borrowers when the programs close, according to the Fed.
The Fed is still working on disclosure policies for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, designed to assist the flow of credit to consumers and the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility, which supports loans to small businesses to encourage them to keep workers on the payroll.
On the Main Street lending facilities, aimed at firms with 10,000 employers or less, the Fed will disclose both borrowers and bank intermediaries. The same approach will hold for the TALF if the Fed chooses immediate disclosure."
"April 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/whats-the-point-in-downgrading-italys-debt/2020/04/24/6bf12cb2-862e-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,The Washington Post,What’s the Point in Downgrading Italy’s Debt?,"It’s like the 2012 euro crisis all over again, as Europe awaits a decision on Italy’s sovereign-debt rating from S&P Global Ratings after Friday’s market close. The country’s current BBB (negative outlook) is just a couple of notches above the junk-bond category, so there’s plenty of investor interest in what happens. Moody’s Investors Service will assess its rating, which is one notch lower, next week.
It doesn’t make much sense that the finances of one of the world’s largest economies are beholden to Delphic judgments from commercial agencies.
It’s unlikely that Italy will be cut to junk. Even if it is, the European Central Bank will keep buying Rome’s debt. But an eventual loss of the country’s investment-grade rating would matter. Many bond funds would have to sell Italian sovereign debt and other related credits. It could cause financial distress to the nation’s finances, and to the European Union.
Surely we need a more realistic, and more flexible, rating system to avoid a credit shock during the Covid-19 crisis — which is no individual country’s fault.
Both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank appreciate the dilemma and are making efforts to either purchase higher-quality junk-rated debt, or to accept it as collateral, but we need to change the way we rigorously evaluate credit risk. What’s the point of creating “fallen angels” — the name given to bonds that have dropped below investment grade since the pandemic struck — if the world’s biggest bond buyers then have to implement special measures to ignore the downgrades?
S&P downgraded six times more companies in the first quarter of 2020 than it upgraded. Moody’s has taken negative rating action against nearly a quarter of the companies it classifies as speculative grade, largely because of the coronavirus. It expects the gap in creditworthiness between junk and investment grade to widen. This deluge needs to be managed before it overwhelms even the best efforts of the world’s central bankers.
Credit ratings are too blunt an instrument right now, given the vast — and necessary — escalation of debt. The requirement of investment-grade bond indexes to only allow specifically rated bonds is an accident waiting to happen. A wave of more downgrades is coming.
The agencies could help by adopting new methodologies to make it less binary for bond indexes and fixed-income funds when credit is downgraded. With so much debt being reclassified downward, we need a system that considers creditworthiness relative to other sovereigns and corporates, rather than looking at individual cases in an absolute way as we do now. 
With half of America’s investment-grade companies sitting in the BBB bucket (just above the junk divide) and more than 200 billion euros ($216 billion) of European credits close to the edge, there’s an overwhelming need to address this anomaly.
The penalty for falling on the wrong side of the divide is too severe. It has a sizable effect on credit spreads (the difference between a bond’s yield and that of its benchmark), with a one-notch downgrade often being punitive. The average spread between junk BB-rated European credits and investment grade BBB stuff blew out to almost 400 basis points from an average of about 100 basis points at one point during this crisis.
The credit markets themselves function pretty well in determining how a bond should be valued. Netflix Inc., for example, managed to achieve its lowest-ever yield Thursday for a $1 billion debt sale despite only having a relatively lowly BB- junk rating. That makes sense for a company whose business model is suited to people staying at home. Investor demand was more than 10 times what was on offer. On the flip side of the coin, Carnival Corp., the ailing cruises company, had to pay nearly 12% to raise funds in March despite being technically still investment grade. Investors know how to price this debt. 
In fairness, the ratings agencies can’t provide real-time credit validation when they rely on actual data rather than presumption. But they need to adapt to the changing reality of Covid-19 — and quickly."

“As we face coronavirus, Joe has been a voice of reason and resilience, with a clear path to lead us out of this crisis,” said Pelosi (Calif.).
With a prerecorded video, Pelosi gave the latest in a well-planned string of endorsements that Biden’s advisers have scheduled to drive attention to Biden’s campaign, which has a far more limited reach than President Trump’s operation.
Pelosi follows former president Barack Obama, former vice president Al Gore, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), among others, in recording testimonials for Biden.
“When our nation faced the Great Recession, it was Joe Biden who led the implementation — and the accountability — of the Recovery Act, helping create and save millions of jobs,” Pelosi said in the video. “When the Democratic Congress was passing the Affordable Care Act, Joe Biden was a partner for progress in the White House and also championed the Cancer Moonshot.”
Although Biden remains about 600 pledged delegates short of the 1,991 needed to win the Democratic nomination, all of his rivals in the party have suspended their campaigns or endorsed him, making his coronation this summer a near certainty.
As a result, Biden has been moving to take control of the Democratic Party. Jen O’Malley Dillon, his campaign manager, announced Friday that she had installed a new chief executive at the Democratic National Committee and the two organizations signed a joint fundraising agreement.
Pelosi stayed neutral during the Democratic primary, repeatedly cautioning the party to keep its eye on the ultimate prize of defeating Trump, despite several House members running for president and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, one of the major financial backers of the 2018 Democratic House takeover, running as well.
The last time Pelosi endorsed a presidential nominee before the outcome of the primaries was clear came in during the 2004 cycle, when she backed the campaign of Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).
Earlier this year, when many moderate Democrats in the House feared Sanders would win the nomination and jeopardize their seats, Pelosi asked for party unity, even as she made clear that the House would not necessarily run on Sanders’s policy platform.
“We have to win in certain particular areas,” she said at the time. “It is not unusual for a party platform or the candidates for president to have their own agenda that they would put forth, and it’s not unusual for the House of Representatives to have its agenda as well.”
Such concerns have faded with Biden’s apparent assurance of the nomination.
“I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for president: a leader who is the personification of hope and courage, values, authenticity and integrity,” Pelosi said in the video Monday. “With so much at stake, we need the enthusiasm, invigoration and participation of all Americans — up and down the ballot, and across the country.”"
"April 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/27/founders-never-intended-postal-service-be-managed-like-business/,The Washington Post,The Founders never intended the U.S. Postal Service to be managed like a business,"To combat the coronavirus, Congress has seemingly tried to bail out everyone: Millions of individuals, airlines, restaurants, retail businesses and even golf courses are among the beneficiaries of the government’s largesse.
But so far, one struggling institution has come up empty: the U.S. Postal Service. On Friday, President Trump threatened to block a loan to the Postal Service, calling it “a joke” and demanding postal administrators raise the price of packages by “approximately four times,” before tweeting later that he would “never let our Post Office fail.”
Trump’s intransigence is a startling departure from precedent. From the 1850s until the 1960s, Congress routinely covered whatever deficits the Postal Service incurred — no matter how large — and with little controversy, partisanship or debate. Why? Because the Postal Service was a public service, whose rationale was civic rather than commercial. As a New York journalist put it in 1854: The Postal Service’s “benefit to mankind” far outweighed the “pecuniary consideration” of any financial shortfall. In 1958, a federal law made this even clearer: The Postal Service was “clearly not a business enterprise conducted for profit.”
To justify his threat, Trump claimed the Postal Service has been “mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the Internet and modern-day technology,” which renders it less worthy of support than an ordinary business. This is a profound misunderstanding of the Postal Service’s DNA.
The Founders intended the Postal Service to be a pillar of the republic, binding together millions of Americans, urban and rural, for the common good. It therefore always had congressional oversight limiting what management can do to make a profit. Rather than being mismanaged, the Postal Service is — and has long been — one of America’s great successes. Instead of privatizing it, we should take inspiration from the Founders and re-envision its mission for the 21st century.
Before 1792, the Postal Service was basically a carbon copy of the imperial post office British colonial administrators had set up decades before the War of Independence. Little more than a chain of offices along the Atlantic seaboard — today known as the “Old Post Road” — it provided no special facilities for the press and served at best a tiny percentage of the public — mostly merchants, professionals and government officials.
The Postal Service Act of 1792 changed everything, investing the Postal Service with an expansive civic mission. While the law had no ringing preamble, it was at least as important as the First Amendment in laying the groundwork for free institutions. The act established mechanisms for rapid expansion from the seaboard into the hinterland, ultimately creating a continent-spanning postal network. This information infrastructure facilitated the rise of a nationwide market, the invention of the mass political party and the proliferation of nationally oriented voluntary associations. With the Postal Service, Congress created the world French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville would laud as the world’s first democracy when he visited the United States in 1831.
Most critically, the act subsidized the circulation of newspapers throughout the country on a nonpreferential basis and at extremely low cost. Not only pro-government ideas but also anti-government ideas could circulate throughout the length and breadth of the republic. Before 1792, newspapers had been officially excluded from the mail; after 1792, they circulated in numbers unmatched by any other country in the world.
For James Madison, the low-cost nonpreferential circulation of newspapers was a political imperative. By helping Americans speak truth to power, House Speaker Jonathan Trumbull Jr. proclaimed the Postal Service “among the surest means of preventing the degeneracy of a free people.” President George Washington went so far as to propose unsuccessfully that every newspaper go in the mail free of charge. For the Founders, a well-informed citizenry, not profit-making for even letter delivery, was the reason the Postal Service was so crucial to the future of the republic.
The 19th-century Postal Service circulated information indispensable for commerce, public affairs and personal matters throughout the country and around the world rapidly, accurately and at low cost. No other organization of any kind came close to its achievement.
The combination of expansive mission and oversight from Congress also meant deficits were to be expected. Low-cost circulation of all of these periodicals was expensive.
Rather than arouse ire, however, Americans — Democrats and Republicans alike — preferred this deficit-running operation to its rivals. Telegraph giant Western Union was widely reviled in its post-Civil War heyday for its narrow business strategy and reliance on what we would today call fake news to beat back calls for reform. In fact, countless reformers in the 1880s wanted the Postal Service to take over Western Union and run it in accordance with the egalitarian “post office principle” — access for all, at low cost, without regard to the expense. Civic ideals trumped any consideration of the bottom line. Pundits have it wrong; not the telegraph, but the Postal Service, was the true Victorian Internet. The telegraph catered to an upscale urban clientele; the Postal Service provided cheap and convenient service for the entire population.
This history explains just how misguided most of today’s criticisms of the Postal Service are. The Postal Service is not failing to compete with its rivals because of mismanagement. To the contrary, postal administrators have innovated in many realms, from railway mail and farm-to-home delivery to commercial aviation and optical scanning. Never, however, and certainly not today, have they been able to operate independently of stringent regulatory oversight. Additionally, the post-1792 Postal Service was not intended primarily to deliver letters. If it had been, one might plausibly argue that it had become anachronistic in an age in which billions of emails circulate around the world at instantaneous speed. But while the mail bags once were stuffed full of newspapers and magazines, in recent years they are increasingly filled with packages essential to civic well-being in the 21st century.
In fact, the Postal Service today works closely with Fed Ex, Amazon (Jeff Bezos is both the chief executive of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post) and UPS to ensure goods of all kinds reach their intended destination — especially over the “last mile” between the long-distance carrier and the home or office — which is extremely expensive to serve. Without the Postal Service, countless Americans — including, in particular, those living in the vast rural hinterland — would pay far more for all kinds of shipments, including prescription drugs.
Rather than pushing for privatization — a move that might well oblige online behemoths such as Amazon or Walmart to consider buying up postal assets at bargain basement prices — public officials mindful of the wisdom of the Founders might well consider expanding the ambit of the Postal Service to include high-tech “last mile” capabilities: the reestablishment of a low-cost consumer banking system, a popular service the Postal Service maintained for much of the 20th century, or even the rollout of a low-cost municipal broadband. Rural electrification transformed vast swaths of the hinterland; might not rural Postal Services be configured as hubs for the digital economy of tomorrow? The Postal Service also will play a crucial role in ensuring trustworthy mail balloting, a major issue in the age of covid-19.
The Postal Service remains the most admired federal government institution — recent polls put its popularity around 90 percent. It provides good jobs at a living wage to 500,000 people, including a disproportionate number of veterans and African Americans. Public figures in a democracy should not be so dismissive of the public will or of an institution that has for so long served the country well. Nor should they forget the Postal Service’s original mission or the wisdom of the Founders.
A crisis is a terrible thing to waste. If anything, now is time to re-envision the long-successful mission of the post office for a new age."
"April 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/27/lysol/,The Washington Post,Trump apologists’ defense has been obliterated by ‘But Lysol’,"As the death toll mounted, the unemployment rate zoomed well into double-digit territory and the fantasy of a quick end to the pandemic faded, President Trump’s polling numbers had already dropped. A series of polls last week showed him trailing nationally and losing against former vice president Joe Biden in Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. His advice to reopen the economy backfired as the country overwhelming signaled disapproval of the AstroTurfed protests and the popularity of governors whom Trump criticized rose. And then came the moment that perfectly epitomized his presidency, captured word for word in an ad for Republicans for the Rule of Law:
When your opponents can run a minute of your own blathering, it pretty much proves you blew it. But this is not simply another gaffe for Trump or even another dumb idea like the wall. This was an extended conversation reflecting the grotesque ignorance and total unfitness of the man who at every turn has failed to protect the country during the worst domestic crisis since the Great Depression. It illustrated how he intellectually corrupts those around him, forcing them to sacrifice their own credibility to defend his inanities.
During the preceding three years, when Trump critics pointed to his incompetence, racism, cruelty, lying, contempt for democracy, economic illiteracy or xenophobia, his defenders would retort “but tax cuts” or “but Gorsuch.” Essentially, they argued, we had to forget about everything else because Trump had bestowed upon the right their precious tax cuts (along with a sustained recovery) and Supreme Court picks that gave conservatives a 5-4 majority on most cases.
The apologists ignored that any conservative president would have produced similar results or that policy ends do not justify the destruction of civility, decency or democracy. Nevertheless, it was enough to keep on board the wealthy donor class and the right-wing evangelical Christian hypocrites who were pleased to overlook his un-Christian conduct and character for the sake of some judges. It was enough to satisfy those willing to be persuaded and unwilling to admit their vote for him had been a tragic mistake.
Now, however, the disaster that Trump has been utterly incapable of addressing has wiped out the value of those tax cuts (and the stock market) and taken more than 50,000 American lives. Whatever his apologists’ defense, the response to his previous (now virtually imperceptible) accomplishments has been obliterated by “But Lysol” — that is, his mind-boggling unfitness leading him to ignore real threats and promote dangerous behavior.
The more Trump’s sycophantic aides defend him, the worse he looks and the greater the concern that he has created a cult that is unable to inform or educate him. Coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, as she has done so often, refused to contradict Trump outright on Sunday on “Meet the Press,” thereby “perpetuating an unscientific, untested, single study presented by a nonscientist from the Department of Homeland Security,” as NBC’s Andrea Mitchell put it. Meanwhile, sentient politicians were compelled to reiterate to the public, as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) did, ""Unequivocally, no one should be using disinfectant to digest it to fight covid-19. Please don’t do it. Just don’t do it.”
Well, Trump has said dumb things before, you say. Very true, but in a presidential campaign, there are times when a candidate says something that essentially seals his fate by epitomizing the deepest concerns about his character, values or policies. For Mitt Romney in 2012, it was his comments at a fundraiser that “47 percent who are with [President Barack Obama], who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them. … I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.” This was the Monopoly man in the top hat, the heartless capitalist speaking. Any chance he might have had to defeat the incumbent president went flying out the window.
In 1976, it was President Gerald Ford’s debate comments: “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration. … I don’t believe that the Romanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I don’t believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.” In an instant, the caricature of a befuddled, inept president sprang to life; no amount of damage control was going to revive his campaign.
Trump has decided to run for cover, insisting now that the news conferences are a “waste of time” while aides suggest he will not be appearing or at least not appearing as often as he had been. The Biden campaign can mourn the loss of new material for their campaign ads, but the last and most compelling message, Trump’s reckless and unbelievably dumb Lysol advice — what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called “embalming” — is left hanging. We have the perfect encapsulation of a president whose defects make him not simply useless but a menace to America."
"April 27, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/businesses-push-to-delay-minimum-wage-hikes-secured-by-democrats/2020/04/27/a25a0b32-8865-11ea-80df-d24b35a568ae_story.html,The Washington Post,Democrats Feel Business Heat to Delay Their Minimum-Wage Hikes,"Business groups are pressuring Democratic officials in several states to postpone planned minimum-wage increases, arguing that embattled businesses can’t afford to give workers a raise as they face the coronavirus-related economic crisis.
Virginia, California, Illinois, Michigan and Massachusetts are among the states where small-business advocates and groups representing restaurants, hotels and other industries are urging delays in wage increases agreed to before the outbreak, and its related business shutdowns, began.
They’ve had some success, even in states governed by Democrats, showing how fundamentally altered political thinking has become, and how rapidly, as a result of the pandemic-driven downturn. Delaying wage increases, even temporarily, would be a pullback in a long, intensive campaign by progressives to force companies to pay the lowest-compensated workers more.
In Virginia, the General Assembly voted this month to approve a four-month delay, to May 2021 from January, in raising the state’s minimum wage to $9.50 an hour from $7.25.“While I want to make sure we’re taking care of our workers across Virginia, I also want to make sure we come out of this economic crisis in as strong a position as I can,” said Democratic Governor Ralph Northam.
Essential Workers
Many low-wage jobs, such as those in health care and food services, are also considered essential. That means people who hold the positions risk getting sick or infecting others by being unable to practice social distancing in the workplace, or to work from home. And those who lost their jobs during the lockdowns will have more debts when companies start hiring again.
Even in liberal California, local governments are listening to the chambers of commerce and business owners who’ve long resisted minimum-wage hikes by saying it will reduce the number of people they can hire.
Hayward, a city near San Francisco, is postponing a planned increase, and officials in nearby Fremont and Alameda are weighing similar measures. Business groups have urged California Governor Gavin Newsom to push off a statewide wage increase scheduled for January.
Four years ago, during the long economic expansion, California and New York approved gradual increases in state-mandated minimum wages. Other states followed, and now 29 states and the District of Columbia require their minimum wage to be higher than the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, which has been in place since July 2009. In many states, automatic increases will continue pushing the minimum wage higher in coming years.
Familiar Arguments
As stay-at-home orders starve many businesses of revenue, groups representing those sectors are reviving the arguments many made opposing the schedule of required wage increases wherever they can.“Small businesses in California and across the nation are frightened, fragile and uncertain about what tomorrow will bring, let alone the next 12 months,” said John Kabateck, California director for the National Federation of Independent Business. “These types of cost increases during a time like this forces small-business owners to draw from what they don’t have.”In Virginia, the minimum wage was scheduled to rise to $9.50 in January, followed by gradual increases lifting it to $12 an hour by 2023. The legislature’s approval of a four-month delay doesn’t affect the schedule for additional hikes in future years. The body also approved a Northam-backed four-month delay in allowing collective bargaining by public-sector employees.In Illinois, Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain, has resisted a delay in raising the minimum wage. The requirement rose to $9.25 an hour in Illinois in January and is scheduled to increase to $10 an hour on July 1, on its way to $15 by 2025.
Why a Second Wave of Covid-19 Is Already a Worry: QuickTake“We’re all concerned that we bring this economy back to where it should be,” Pritzker said. “The truth is, I think the current conditions actually indicate more than ever before why we need to raise the minimum wage across the state. It is a very small raise.”Labor groups say the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic is placing extreme pressures on people living at or below the poverty line as unemployment has swelled to almost 20%.“We’re vehemently opposing an effort to delay an increase that workers have been counting on in an unprecedented economic environment,” said Steve Smith, spokesman for the California Labor Federation. “The economic pressures they’re facing are unlike anything we’ve ever seen, and the last thing we want to do is take wages out of their pocket.”California’s Newsom, a Democrat, hasn’t said whether he would support a delay in the next scheduled increase in California’s minimum wage -- to $14 an hour in January for companies with at least 26 employees, and $13 an hour for those with 25 or fewer.
Grounds for Delay
The law that mandated the wage increases, negotiated and promoted by former Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, allows the state to delay them if unemployment rises and sales and tax receipts fall, or if its finance director estimates that the state budget will show a deficit.The NFIB has asked about delaying minimum wage increases in Michigan and Massachusetts and hasn’t received definitive responses, said Tim Goodrich, the group’s executive director of state government relations.Few dispute that widespread social distancing and stay-at-home orders will damage small businesses, especially those in the retail, tourism and restaurant sectors. A 2016 report by JP Morgan Chase & Co. found that half of all small businesses can survive for only for about 27 days without new revenue; the average restaurant has a cash buffer of 16 days and the average retail business 19 days, according to the study.
Shutting for Good
In California, the association that represents restaurants warned Newsom in March that as many of 30% of the state’s 90,000 eating establishments may permanently close without the postponement of minimum wage increases and other state aid, such as deferral of payroll taxes.In the NFIB’s monthly national survey of small businesses, its “optimism index” showed the largest one-month drop on record in March, and the group expects the survey to show a wave of business closures in April, said Holly Wade, the organization’s director of research and policy analysis.“The economic impact on the small-business sector is immense,” Wade said. “We won’t know the exact number of small-business closures for a while but the number will certainly be large, far bigger than what was experienced in the Great Recession, given the mandated business closures across most of the country.”
In California, the Hayward city council just two months ago approved an aggressive timetable raising the minimum wage in July to $15 an hour for companies with 26 or more employees and $14 an hour for smaller employers -- 18 months before state requirements are scheduled to reach the same levels. Last month, after Covid-19 began spreading through the state, the same council voted to postpone the increases until July 2021.“Minimum wage increases do eliminate jobs, and in a time like this, we need to preserve them,” said Hayward City Council member Sara Lamnin."

The SBA said that “unprecedented demand” was slowing down its loan-processing platform, and that there were double the number of users accessing the system compared with any day during the initial round of funding that ended April 16. The SBA said in a statement that it had processed more than 100,000 applications from more than 4,000 lenders as of 3:30 p.m. New York time.
Shortly after the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program restarted this morning, lenders reported that they either couldn’t access the system or were being kicked out as they tried to submit applications on behalf of small-business owners, said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America.
Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said in a tweet that his member banks across the country “are deeply frustrated at their inability to access” SBA’s system. He said the association has “raised these issues at the highest levels,” and until they are resolved, banks “will not be able help more struggling small businesses.”
The glitches echo the first round of the program, when lenders were repeatedly locked out of the loan platform. The initiative restarted Monday with $320 billion in fresh funds after the initial $349 billion ran out after just 13 days. Some lenders had thousands of applications ready to go when the system restarted, fueling concerns the extra money would run out fast.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it stopped taking new applications before the initiative relaunched Monday because it was trying to work through a backlog of requests already in its pipeline.
The second round of funding -- similar to the first -- has been plagued by vague guidance and ongoing changes to the process. One senior banker, describing the process on condition of anonymity, said SBA’s decision to allow lenders to submit applications in bulk was unclear and came at the last minute.
The SBA said it notified lenders on Sunday that it would pace the rate of applications into its E-Tran system, meaning that all lenders should be able to submit at the same rate. The pacing mechanism was designed to prevent any one lender from submitting thousands of loans into the system at once. A lender that goes above that limit would get timed out of the system, an agency spokesman said.
But with the SBA limiting applications to 350 per hour per lender, according to a person familiar with the matter, it could take days or even weeks to get each bank’s applications through -- prolonging the amount of time it will take for small businesses in dire need to get their funds.
Merski said lenders are frustrated because they don’t understand how SBA is processing the applications, and the agency hasn’t provided an adequate explanation. It raises the fear that borrowers will get shut out because success may depend on who’s able to access the system before the funding runs out again, he said.
“It’s all serendipity, who gets in and who doesn’t,” Merski said. “There’s some serious issues that need to be addressed.”
The program allows for loans of as much as $10 million per borrower and is meant to help small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic keep workers on their payrolls. The loans become grants if companies use them for payroll and approved expenses for two months.
Even before the first new application was processed Monday, advocates were concerned the additional funding could also be exhausted in a matter of days, won’t be enough to meet demand, and might not reach the entities that need it the most.
The initiative, which first launched April 3, was marred by delays and glitches after guidance on how to process loans wasn’t released until the night before, and many big banks weren’t ready to participate or held back until rules became clearer. Advocates complained that many small mom-and-pop shops were shut out as outrage grew as larger, public companies and big chains got loans.
Bigger companies including Shake Shack Inc. and the operator of Ruth’s Chris steak houses got loans but returned the money after a backlash. A spokeswoman for the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Lakers said on Monday the team qualified for a $4.6 million loan, but repaid it after learning funds had been depleted.
The American Hotel & Lodging Association, which had won special consideration for hotels in the program after a last-ditch lobbying campaign -- even issued a study Monday suggesting that hotel owners could end up with a better cash flow position if they didn’t take the loans and closed their doors instead.
The SBA and U.S. Treasury Department have sought to avoid pitfalls from the first round. They issued new guidance last week reaffirming that companies must certify they were affected by the pandemic and telling large firms with access to other capital they shouldn’t apply -- and that firms can return loans by May 7 without penalty. Hedge funds and private-equity firms were told they were ineligible.
More than $2 billion from the first round was declined or returned and will now be made available, SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza said in a tweet on Monday. Congress also set aside $60 billion for small financial institutions with $50 billion or less in assets to ensure better access for smaller firms.
Still, large banks including Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have been preparing to submit a barrage of loan applications that weren’t processed the first round or have been accepted since then.
To ensure access for all of the more than 5,000 lenders approved to participate in the program, the SBA announced on Sunday it’s capping loans from each bank at $60 billion and pacing the acceptance of applications while allowing lenders to submit them in batches -- initially set at a minimum of 15,000 and revised Monday to 5,000 or more that must be submitted by 9 p.m. on Monday."

"April 28, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/27/will-this-crisis-change-republican-party-dont-bet-it/,The Washington Post,Will this crisis change the Republican Party? Don’t bet on it.,"When a crisis occurs, the common response from politicians is what economist Larry Summers once termed “now-more-than-everism.” Everyone says the solution lies in the policies they’ve favored all along, which are needed now more than ever.
Except some crises are less amenable to one side’s now-more-than-ever than others. While Democrats can comfortably say that the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis demand the kind of aggressive government action and strong safety net they always favor, Republicans are in a more complicated position. Which is why we’re seeing the first signs of a conflict that could roil their party after November, should Donald Trump lose his bid for reelection.
Not that most Republicans have had their minds changed by this crisis. They’ve gone along with a few trillion dollars in spending, but they’re hardly agreeing that we actually could use universal health coverage and automatic stabilizers that offer quick help to people in any economic downturn.
And they’ll be more than happy to begin deficit fearmongering as an excuse for austerity at the earliest opportunity — i.e., if there’s a Democrat in the White House to suffer the consequences. “As soon as the economy recovers, we are going to need significant deficit reforms,” one conservative economist told The Post. You may recall that even before the pandemic, Trump and Republicans had pushed the deficit past a trillion dollars, with only the most muted objections from conservatives. Should Trump be reelected, all those who claim to be deeply concerned about the debt will say that we really should do something about it — but not quite yet, not when cutting spending or raising taxes might be too damaging to a Republican president.
But what if Trump loses? How will the party understand what happened and where they should go?
There will be two competing narratives among Republicans, which come down to this question: Was it him, or was it us? Was Trump just an anomaly, and therefore we don’t need to change much of what we’ve been doing? Or do we need to rethink the policies we’ve been offering the public?
As Politico reports, a relatively small group of Washington Republicans, including Sens. Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley, are trying to fashion a new kind of bigger-government conservatism that is more willing to intervene in the economy (Rubio, who chairs the Small Business Committee, helped craft the Paycheck Protection Program in the economic rescue package). One of its goals would be to convince voters that the GOP doesn’t want to just leave everyone at the mercy of an economy defined by increasing inequality and occasional catastrophe, but can help create prosperity with something other than tax cuts for the wealthy.
And there seems to be an awareness among at least some Republicans that, politically, the worst thing they could do right now is give free rein to their laissez-faire impulses. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell advocated letting states go bankrupt rather than give them the help they need to avoid making this recession worse, a number of Republicans pushed back on the idea, taking the position that we need to keep state budgets from imploding.
It’s too early to tell where Senate Republicans will end up on the next rescue bill, and whether it will include aid to states (and how much). But the safest bet is that once this crisis has passed, they’ll treat the whole thing like a vaguely remembered dream that need not affect long-term policy. What happens in a pandemic/recession stays in a pandemic/recession.
If Trump loses, every Republican will have an incentive to perform their own now-more-than-everism, because that will absolve them of both responsibility and the need to alter their views. We lost that election, they’ll say, because Trump was such a uniquely problematic figure, someone who alienated so many voters and then had the bad luck to be confronted with a crisis he was incapable of managing. All we need to do is rerun the playbook from the Obama years: Oppose everything President Biden tries to do, attempt to impose austerity policies that hamstring the recovery, whip up anger in our base and reap the political rewards.
Which might work, or it might not. It will, however, be much easier — both practically and psychologically — than admitting that what the party has been advocating has been wrong, and trying to come up with a different program to sell.
We’ve seen this kind of struggle before. After they lost 2012, Republicans commissioned a report that warned that if the party didn’t craft “a more welcoming conservatism” and make itself appealing to young people and Latinos, it risked a steady slide into minority status. Then Donald Trump came along with the insight that being welcoming was the last thing the party’s base wanted.
One of the casualties of Trump’s rise was Rubio, who tried to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, then found himself vilified for it on the right. The same thing might happen to him again if he runs for president in 2024.
Or it could be that his timing would be better the second time around. Perhaps there will be an appetite for a less hard-edge, anti-immigrant form of conservatism. Perhaps someone like Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland currently enjoying sky-high approval ratings in his heavily Democratic state, will make a compelling case for the party to nominate a moderate. Perhaps, if Trump loses in 2020, the party will be so eager to rid themselves of his stench that they’ll be willing to rethink everything they’ve been doing.
It’s possible. But I wouldn’t bet on it."

Not only is this strategy misguided and potentially harmful to millions of people, it is also based on skewed claims about the agency’s role, notably by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
A seed of the administration’s issue with the WHO is a valid complaint against China, whose leaders concealed information about the novel coronavirus in late December and in January. They hid information about the spreading contagion and its human transmission when more aggressive action and disclosure could have helped brake the spread. China’s leaders have an obligation to be more forthcoming about the origin of the virus and the coverups.
But it is wrong to blame the WHO for China’s failures. In a news conference last week, Mr. Pompeo declared that Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus “failed” to “enforce” the International Health Regulations, the rules underlying the WHO, concerning transparency and disclosure. The United States and other nations revised and put those rules into effect in 2007. But Mr. Tedros had no power to coerce China. The WHO lacks the compliance muscle of, say, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which strictly regulates nuclear materials. The WHO is dependent on the decisions and actions of its members. The International Health Regulations had no enforcement mechanism because the countries wanted it that way to protect their sovereignty. The WHO can’t just swoop into Wuhan, China, and make demands.
Mr. Tedros and his top advisers were too quick to praise China in their public comments early in the outbreak. But the reality of the WHO is that its greatest power is persuasion; the agency successfully negotiated an expert delegation’s visit to China in the middle of the crisis. Mr. Pompeo’s criticism ignores this balancing act. Now, according to a report in The Post, Mr. Pompeo is spearheading a campaign not only to delay U.S. government funds to the agency but also to sideline it by shifting funds to other groups or starting a parallel organization. This small-minded approach will damage the WHO and disrupt global cooperation in fighting diseases. The agency takes risks on the front lines that benefit the United States by keeping diseases at bay. A courageous WHO mission to Congo fought Ebola virus disease and measles in recent years in a struggle so treacherous that U.S. experts were barred from participating due to security concerns.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) expressed concern that the United States not abandon the WHO, particularly in the midst of a pandemic. Hopefully other sensible Republicans will join with Democrats to block the administration’s counterproductive moves. Mr. Pompeo and President Trump ought to quit making the WHO a scapegoat for their own management failures in combating the virus."

Bernie Sanders’s campaign excoriated New York election officials Monday for canceling the state’s Democratic presidential primary, opening a new rift in a party trying to mend its divisions following a competitive fight for the nomination.
Although Sanders (I-Vt.) has suspended his campaign and endorsed former vice president Joe Biden, he has expressed a desire to remain on ballots in states with upcoming nominating contests. He hopes to continue amassing delegates to the party’s national convention to gain influence over the platform and other decisions.
That plan received a blow when Democratic commissioners on the state Board of Elections opted to remove Sanders from the New York ballot, thereby scrapping the June 23 primary. Senior Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver responded with a scathing statement on behalf of the senator’s campaign, calling the decision a “blow to American democracy” that should be rectified by the Democratic National Committee.
“Just last week Vice President Biden warned the American people that President Trump could use the current crisis as an excuse to postpone the November election,” Weaver said in the statement, which Sanders promoted on Twitter. “Well, he now has a precedent thanks to New York state.”
Not so, an elections expert said. “This is a totally separate matter,” said Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections at Common Cause, a nonprofit group that advocates for eased ballot access. “You’re comparing apples to oranges.”
Albert noted that Congress determines the timing of federal elections and that the president does not have the power to change that.
Weaver suggested that instead of terminating the primary, New York should have changed it to an entirely vote-by-mail system to alleviate safety concerns about voting during the coronavirus pandemic.
“If this is not remedied, New York should lose all its delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention and there should be a broader review by the Democratic Party of New York’s checkered pattern of voter disenfranchisement,” Weaver said.
Democratic National Committee spokesman David Bergstein said in a statement: “Any substantive change to a state’s first determining step in allocating delegates like this one will need to be reviewed by the DNC’s Rules and By-Laws Committee. Once the state party submits an updated delegate selection plan, the committee will review that plan and make a determination.”
Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias, however, noted on Twitter that the DNC does not set or cancel primaries.
A Biden campaign spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The development marked at least a hiccup in the effort to smooth relations in the party. In the weeks since Sanders suspended his campaign, Democrats have largely rallied around Biden’s candidacy.
The New York election commissioners discussed the primary and the potential impact of the pandemic via videoconference Monday morning. They reviewed, among other things, a communication from the Sanders campaign urging the board to preserve his status on the ballot.
But the commissioners concluded that Sanders’s decision to suspend his campaign and support Biden effectively ended the competition — turning it into a “beauty contest,” in the words of Douglas Kellner, a co-chair of the board — and that his justification for wanting to remain on the ballot was insufficient. They supported a resolution that left Biden as the only remaining contender.
New York is one of a raft of states that decided to postpone its presidential primary amid concerns about the pandemic. Officials had put off the primary, originally slated for April 28, until June 23. Now, it will not happen at all.
“The two Democratic Commissioners removed all candidates from the ballot except Joe Biden,” John Conklin, the director of public information for the state elections board, said in an email. “By operation of law, N.Y. does not hold uncontested primaries. So their action de facto eliminates the Democratic presidential primary and Joe Biden is effectively the winner of the N.Y. primary.”
Sanders’s allies panned the move. “I’m amazed at this decision,” said Larry Cohen, chairman of the pro-Sanders group Our Revolution and a Maryland delegate to the Democratic convention. “It totally violates DNC rules. Many of us who do support the election of Joe Biden will nonetheless be forced to go to the credentials committee and challenge any delegation New York may send to the convention.”
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who supported Sanders in the primary, wrote on Twitter: “Primary results matters beyond who wins 1st place. Sen. Sanders explicitly stated that he intended on continuing to collect delegates in order to advance wage, healthcare, climate & other priorities into the platform at the convention. The @DNC should respond to this decision.”
“Unity isn’t a feeling, it’s a process,” she added."

Businesses are vanishing in huge numbers. Much of the economy is on life support as fear of a pandemic keeps Americans at home. Global trade and investment are collapsing. The economy is looking at the possibility of a long-lasting depression.
So why is the stock market doing so well? The S&P 500 Index is down for the year, but it has recovered by half from its March low point:
Meanwhile, the Shiller cyclically adjusted price-earnings, or CAPE, ratio, a common measure of stock-market valuation, is still at levels that prevailed in the mid-2000s before the financial crisis, suggesting that stocks are still expensive:
It’s possible that stock market investors simply expect the economic recovery after the end of lockdowns to be swift and robust. But that’s looking increasingly unlikely. The U.S. has failed to suppress the epidemic, and lifting lockdowns is unlikely to bring people out of their houses as long as the threat of the virus remains. Meanwhile, business closures, mass unemployment and the collapse of global trade will weaken the economy for years to come.
A more disturbing possibility is that investors have decided that the U.S. government will prioritize preserving stock market valuations regardless of what happens to the rest of the economy.
This isn’t a completely new idea. Ever since Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan cut interest rates after the stock market crash of 1987, there has been talk of a so-called Greenspan Put — a commitment on behalf of the central bank to support asset prices. But the Greenspan Put was probably never just about the stock market. Although the correlation is very noisy, stocks are generally believed to be a leading indicator of recession. By cutting rates as soon as the market fell, Fed leaders were probably just attempting to get in front of a coming downturn.
The current situation might be different. President Donald Trump clearly views the stock market as a key barometer of his own success as a leader. It was only when the market plunged in March that Trump began to treat the pandemic with the seriousness it deserved. This might be because of his own stockholdings, or it might be the result of years of consuming conservative op-eds that treat the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the be-all and end-all of economic health.
But Trump isn’t the only one who’s personally invested in the markets. At the beginning of the 1990s, only about a third of Americans owned stocks; now,  more than half do. The rise of 401(k) retirement plans and shifts in allocation by pension funds seeking higher returns democratized equity ownership. Although wealthy Americans still own the bulk of stocks, the middle class has enough of a stake that propping up the stock market is probably a political winner. That could influence Congress, future presidents and even the Fed.
There is therefore now a possibility that the government — the Fed, Congress and the president — may all reliably act to buttress the stock market, independently of whether such action supports the economy. Call it the Golden Put.
One way the Golden Put could happen is if the Federal Reserve buys common stocks. This now is against the rules, but other central banks, such as the Bank of Japan, do it regularly. Already, coronavirus has prompted the Fed to bend the rules about buying corporate bonds, using off-balance-sheet vehicles. Some now are suggesting that the Fed do the same thing to buy stocks. This would support prices, but it probably wouldn’t do much to support economic activity because debt financing is already so cheap.
Another way of implementing the Golden Put would be for Congress to use bailouts and other legislative action to support corporate profit margins. Ideally, emergency loans and grants should support both big and small businesses. But if the programs are structured so that small businesses lose out, it could mean that concentration grows in industries such as retail. That would preserve profit margins — and hence long-term stock market valuations — but it could hurt economic growth through higher prices and lower wages.
The Golden Put would change the fundamental nature of the stock market. Traditionally, equities have been a very risky investment, offering higher returns than bonds in exchange for forcing investors to endure regular declines and even crashes. When things go bad, stocks are supposed to be the first thing that takes a loss. But if the government commits to supporting stock prices, both the risk and reward of stocks could drop. Propping up stock prices reduces risk by removing the possibility of crashes. But knowing that the Golden Put existed would draw lots of new money into the market, raising demand and pushing up prices. In the short run that would mean a big windfall for current stockholders, but it would reduce future expected returns for the new investors.
If the government treats stock prices as a key economic target independent of the rest of the economy, it could both distort growth and turn stocks into something more akin to bonds or cash. Both the Fed and Congress should be very wary of establishing a Golden Put."

About 15% of companies in the regions with the biggest declines in hours worked and most business shutdowns received funds from the first tranche of the Paycheck Protection Program, according to the paper from researchers at the University of Chicago’s Booth School, Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School and the National Bureau of Economic Research.
In congressional districts least affected, firms received double that share.
“We find no evidence that funds flowed to areas that were more adversely affected by the economic effects of the pandemic,” economists João Granja, Christos Makridis, Constantine Yannelis, and Eric Zwick wrote.
If anything, the data suggests that funds flowed to areas less hard hit, according to the report, with a higher share of businesses receiving loans in “areas with better employment outcomes, fewer Covid-19 related infections and deaths, and less social distancing.”
The findings are key to understanding the state of business and the U.S. economy as it dips into a recession, and how and when it could recover.
The government’s small business loans program ran through its $349 billion in funds within two weeks. An additional $320 billion is set to become available Monday after being approved by lawmakers last week.
Massive Layoffs
The study also provides more transparency on the program as hundreds of thousands of companies rush for cash. So far, more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs in the crisis, basically erasing the job gains seen during the longest U.S. economic expansion.
The researchers used data from the Small Business Administration, the government arm that ran the program, to see which lenders were most active and where. They paired that with figures from Homebase, a software firm that provides scheduling and payroll support for about 100,000 local firms, to gauge the real-time reaction in the labor market via hours, wages, and overall employment -- particularly the hard-hit retail and the hospitality sectors.
Another finding, and one that could explain the skew of funds, is that the top four lenders (JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., and Citigroup Inc.) disbursed less than 3% of PPP loans in the first tranche; they usually account for about one-third of all small business loans.
The banks’ branches are located in parts of the country that received less funding, the researchers found. Wells Fargo also had an asset-cap restriction, which the Federal Reserve removed temporarily earlier this month.
For example, Cleveland, Ohio-based KeyCorp made up a greater share of total PPP volume than Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup combined -- even though its share of small business loans is usually much less, according to the analysis.
Nevertheless there are concerns that in the next round of funding to start Monday, big banks could have the advantage because they’ve been preparing a barrage of loan applications since the first round of the program ended April 16. To help spread the loans among lenders this time, the Small Business Administration is capping the value of loans individual banks can arrange under the program.
Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said Sunday that the government needs to ensure that the lending program is fully-funded and able to provide cash to all small companies that need it, rather than it operating on a first-come, first-served basis."
"April 28, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/templeton-fund-freeze-leaves-a-dangerous-hole/2020/04/26/97806018-8832-11ea-80df-d24b35a568ae_story.html,The Washington Post,Templeton Fund Freeze Leaves a Dangerous Hole,"India’s deepening credit crisis has taken a dangerous turn with Franklin Templeton’s local unit putting six of its debt mutual funds into suspended animation. Before fear guts the economy, the central bank needs to open its cash vaults.
At $4.1 billion, the amount of investor money that’s stuck may not seem systemically important. India’s $2.7 trillion economy has witnessed much larger financial failures in the recent past. But with the coronavirus lockdown decimating incomes and sentiment, leaving the hole unfilled may prove an error of judgment.
Mutual funds are sieves. Losses will be felt in the personal balance sheets of mom-and-pop investors. They will retreat into a shell of risk aversion if they’re told they may not be made whole even after a years-long wait.
That won’t do. Just the top 11 nonbank finance firms have $8.3 billion of debt maturing by September. It’s optimistic to think refinancing will come from banks when they won’t even take cheap funds from the central bank to chase credit risk.
So what needs to be done? The Reserve Bank of India will need to accept assets from debt funds to stop a contagion. Some of these are illiquid bilateral loans masquerading as securities. There’s no public market for them.
This isn’t new. I wrote in November 2018 about how Rana Kapoor, the controlling co-founder of Yes Bank Ltd., was tapping mutual funds to finance other family ventures.
Back then, Franklin Templeton’s unit holders probably had no idea their fund manager was sitting on practically the entire stock of zero-coupon debentures issued by Yes Capital Ltd., one of Kapoor family’s private investment vehicles. That was long before Yes, a major deposit-taking institution, became a basket case that was eventually rescued by a consortium led by government-controlled State Bank of India. The five funds that were involved in lending to Kapoor are among the six that have been suspended, suggesting that nothing really changed between then and now.
Franklin Templeton was the sole lender to 26 of 88 entities in its debt mutual funds, Livemint reports. I want to ask: Where were the regulators?
Shadow lenders have borrowed wholesale from debt mutual funds. This shifting of credit risk away from deposit-taking institutions took place in front of regulators’ eyes. Yet they didn’t push forward long-pending banking reforms to address the issue. The crumbling of nonbank lenders, especially those that had been rolling over debt owed by insolvent property developers, also happened in full public view. Once again the authorities did too little too late. By the time they put together a $3.5 billion last-mile fund to get stalled housing projects completed, the pandemic broke out.
With the disruption caused by the outbreak, the only way some bonds held by mutual funds will ever be repaid is if the government gives corporate borrowers subsidized credit and loan guarantees to tide them over. Many have already requested debt moratoriums from banks. Unless New Delhi offers a decisive backstop, the RBI will be reluctant to open up its balance sheet to entities it normally doesn’t deal with, including debt mutual funds. 
But it must. The country’s shadow banking industry is in mortal danger. Borrowers from microlenders have lost livelihoods and capacity to repay. The pandemic shock isn’t something the private sector can withstand on its own. On Monday, the RBI allowed banks access to a $6.5 billion, 90-day tap if they lend to mutual funds. But banks already have ample liquidity. The question is, why will they advance credit to mutual funds against any less than best-quality corporate paper? Anything less, and the lenders would rather go directly to ultimate borrowers and get better sureties, including business owners’ personal assets.
The British economics writer Walter Bagehot famously said monetary authorities should fight panic by providing liquidity against collateral that’s acceptable in normal times. But there’s a possibility that things won’t normalize anytime soon, at least not for all borrowers. The longer the authorities go on flooding banks with liquidity while denying it to the nonbanks that actually need it, the weaker India’s recovery will be.
India’s banks got into trouble several years ago. As they retreated from financing credit to nurse their $200 billion-plus in bad loans, other institutions stepped in. The unexpected September 2018 bankruptcy of IL&FS Group, followed by the collapse of several other lenders, unearthed the rot in the shadow banking world, especially where it intersects with a lackluster property market. The near-complete halt to activity since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced a shutdown in March to arrest the spread of the disease is merely the final nail. 
When the disease comes under control, there will have to be a reckoning. Mutual fund trustees must temper managers’ temptation to generate returns by loading up on illiquid securities. Rating firms should relearn what AAA means. Shadow banks have to restrict themselves to originating loans, and selling them on. All this is for later. For now, India’s central bank needs to mutter an apology to Bagehot, and just fill the hole left by Franklin Templeton."
"April 28, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/28/who-thinks-trump-is-honest-trustworthy-fox-news-fans-very-few-others/,The Washington Post,"Who thinks Trump is ‘honest and trustworthy’? Fox News fans, and very few others.","As the United States confronts a pandemic with little precedent, we are being guided by a president with a very well-documented problem with basic facts. President Trump has now made more than 18,000 false or misleading claims during his three-plus years in the White House, and his coronavirus commentary has followed suit. In a tweetstorm this weekend, for instance, Trump lodged at least eight easily disproved claims.
Because of this, one of his worst polling numbers has long been honesty and trustworthiness, and a recent poll is one of his worst on that measure. Just 31 percent in a new USA Today/Suffolk University survey said Trump is honest and trustworthy, while 64 percent disagreed. That’s a 2-to-1 ratio against the president’s character.
But that still leaves 3 in 10 Americans who believe the president is honest and trustworthy, despite all the fact-checking and patently false claims.
So who are those 3 in 10 Americans? According to the same survey, they are Fox News fans — and very few others.
Suffolk regularly asks people what their most trusted news source is, which provides a helpful, regular window into the differences between Fox News and non-Fox News viewers. It’s perhaps one of the most significant demographic splits in American politics right now, and the “honest and trustworthy” question bears out why.
According to the Suffolk poll, of the 31 percent of Americans who believe Trump is honest and trustworthy, nearly two-thirds of them say Fox is their favorite news source. Among Fox-first viewers — who comprise about 25 percent of Americans in the survey — 78 percent say Trump is honest and trustworthy, while just 15 percent disagree.
The imbalance is even more striking when you look at people who don’t trust Fox News the most. Among the three-fourths of the population who don’t list Fox as their No. 1 news source, just 15 percent say Trump is honest and trustworthy, while nearly 80 percent say he is not.
Non-Fox-first viewers rate Trump consistently higher among other personality traits. Among them:
29 percent say he’s a strong leader.
23 percent say he “cares about people like me.”
37 percent say he knows how to get things done.
40 percent say he stands up for U.S. interests.
30 percent say he can work with foreign leaders.
So it’s not like these people are overwhelmingly dead set against Trump. Many of them see positives in his character, but very few of them believe honesty is among them.
The question from there is how much this is cause and how much is effect. Fox News certainly covers Trump in a much different way than most any other outlet, with its prime-time opinion hosts often fawning over his alleged achievements and playing down or outright ignoring his falsehoods. Even on the more straight-news side, the coverage is consistently less critical of Trump and declines to dwell so much on when he gets things blatantly wrong.
That doesn’t mean certain reporters and hosts haven’t been critical. But whatever the right balance might be, it’s indisputable that the news Fox viewers are consuming about Trump bears little resemblance to the news that others are.
But are the 25 percent of people who list Fox as their favorite regularly tuning in to Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham or even daytime programming? Undoubtedly not. Although Fox ranks as the most-watched cable news outlet, even its high ratings don’t indicate that a quarter of Americans are watching regularly. It’s plausible that many people who don’t watch Fox much or at all but like Trump will logically associate him with the channel and, when prompted, volunteer Fox as their most trusted news source.
So maybe this is as much or more about people who already like Trump as it is about these people consuming less-critical coverage and not recognizing or caring about Trump’s myriad falsehoods.
But either way, the correlation between Fox News viewership and the few Americans who continue to say the president is honest and trustworthy is remarkable — especially when compared with other traits."

Mnuchin said the loans of as much as $10 million meant to keep workers on payrolls under the Paycheck Protection Program were intended for small firms, not public companies and big chains that have access to other capital. The U.S. Small Business Administration will check that borrowers who took large loans properly certified they were needed because of the coronavirus outbreak, he said.
“I want to be very clear it’s the borrowers who have criminal liability if they made this certification and it’s not true,” Mnuchin said Tuesday on CNBC. “We will make sure that what was the intent for taxpayers is fulfilled here.”
Mnuchin said it was “outrageous” that the Los Angeles Lakers took a $4.6 million relief loan, and that it was inappropriate for other large public companies and big chains to get funding as well.
A backlash against those companies getting relief aid has prompted entities including the Lakers to start returning the money. More than $2 billion from the first round of funding for the program was declined or returned and will now be made available, SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza said in a tweet on Monday.
The SBA and Treasury issued guidance last week reaffirming that companies must certify they were affected by the pandemic and telling large firms with access to other capital they shouldn’t apply -- and that firms can return loans by May 7 without penalty. Hedge funds and private-equity firms were also told they were ineligible.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that the Treasury Department and the SBA failed to give guidelines to the banks providing loans under the PPP that would have pushed more of the financing toward smaller firms.
While Democrats helped get money in new Paycheck Protection Program funds that would be “walled off” for smaller businesses in legislation Congress passed last week, he said the implementation of the small business rescue program has been an “abject failure” and more work is needed.
Speaking on MSNBC, Schumer said he will send a letter Tuesday to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, urging him to convene Senate hearings as soon as next week into the administration’s broader response to the pandemic. Such hearings would allow “tough question after tough question” about the program’s implementation, the lack of adequate testing and other matters, Schumer said.
The relaunch of the Paycheck Protection Program with an additional $320 billion approved by Congress last week got off to a rocky start Monday, with lenders reporting being shut out of the overwhelmed SBA system amid a flood of loan applications and concerns about when struggling companies will get the funding they need.
Mnuchin said on Fox Business that “we did have systems issues yesterday” and the SBA team was “working through the night” to correct the problems. But he said the certification borrowers make when they apply is important because “we’re not going to be able to check all the loans before they go out the door.”
The Treasury secretary said the program is getting funding to small businesses with an average loan size of $206,000 so far, despite the attention the large firms that took relief at the expense of mom-and-pop shops are getting.
“It is unfortunate that there’s a small number of companies that have created a lot of publicity that took loans,” he said on CNBC. “I think it was inappropriate for most of these companies to take the loans.”"

The bank told customers that it wasn’t accepting new applications for the rescue loans because it was trying to work through a backlog of requests already in its pipeline, Jennifer Roberts, chief of the consumer unit’s business-banking division, said in a note to clients Monday, expanding on a message it gave last Thursday.
“I wish we could help every business through this program, but funds could run out again quickly and we have preexisting applications in our queue,” Roberts wrote.
The SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program relaunched Monday at 10:30 a.m. New York time with an additional $320 billion. The initial $349 billion to support small business during the coronavirus pandemic ran out in just 13 days.
Some lenders had thousands of applications to go when the system restarted, creating pent-up demand and fueling concerns the extra money would run out quickly. On Monday, some banks reported that they either couldn’t access the agency’s system or were being kicked out as they tried to process applications.
JPMorgan said it would monitor funding availability in case it can take new loan applications in the future."
"April 28, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/28/you-can-help-slow-virus-if-you-talk-about-it-accurately-online/,The Washington Post,You can help slow the virus if you talk about it accurately online,"As the coronavirus pandemic tears through the United States, and as some governors move toward reopening the economy, reducing the impact of the catastrophe depends on persuading large numbers of people to continue to follow public health guidance. Government mandates in many cities and states have reduced the rate of new infections, but even in states where stay-at-home orders remain in full force, the effect of individual choices remains crucial in preventing a resurgence of the pandemic.
In this context, how can ordinary citizens amplify the most important public health information to keep more people safe while we wait for scientists to develop vaccines and treatments? Behavioral psychology and communication science offer some answers. Social norms are powerful, and ideas are contagious — meaning we each can play a role in spreading the word. This is especially important in our current situation, where misinformation is common.
Many of you reading this may already be able to recite the guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in your sleep: Wash hands more frequently (and for 20 seconds each time), avoid in-person social gatherings even if you don’t feel sick and wear a mask if you must go out. Simply doing those things is a great start. When people see your mask and hear you warmly respond when invited to a group outing, “Let’s do it on FaceTime instead,” they are more likely to act in those ways themselves.
In addition to setting a good example for others, research also suggests that sharing and repeating public health messages — in conversations, on social media and elsewhere — can help change behavior. One study of 518 students found that those living in dorms where researchers posted messages promoting the benefits of hand-washing washed their hands more frequently compared to those living in dorms where the researchers didn’t post messages; and the more that students reported talking about the campaign with their friends, the more they also reported washing their hands. Word-of-mouth made the campaign effective even among students in dorms that weren’t directly exposed to the original campaign. Conveniently, you can start this process close to home: In an analysis of 28 studies that collectively included 138,898 participants, conversations about public-health messages had the most effect when related from one romantic partner to another.
So, what kinds of messages should you focus on sharing with others, and what should you say when you share? You should stick to sharing clear, evidence-based messages that are consistent with guidance from expert nonpartisan sources such as the WHO, the CDC or state public-health offices. Such organizations may update some of their advice as new facts come to light, but information from such nonpartisan sources gives us the best consensus of scientific and health experts at any given time.
How we relate this information can matter, too. Sharing personal stories, research suggests, can sometimes be more effective than showering people with numbers and statistics; stories often generate less counter-argumentation. People also like to share content that they think presents them in a good light — information or narratives that indirectly highlight their positive attributes. For example, if you call to the attention of your social network information ways that you are connecting with loved ones while physically distancing, or point to opportunities to help others in your community, your friends — in addition to finding it useful and following your example — may share it because they want to be perceived as people who connect and who care. This can have ripple effects.
What’s more, there is considerable evidence that emotional messages are more likely to be shared online. High-arousal emotions such as humor, inspiration, anger, fear and outrage increase message virality. But not all high-arousal emotions are alike. Unlike humor or uplifting sentiment, outrage may backfire by activating partisan biases. Politicizing your messages can make people who disagree with you defensively avoid the information — even if they would otherwise share your desire to follow the best expert advice, and thereby help people.
As case numbers and deaths climb, more people have been sharing frightening accounts of what it’s like to suffer from covid-19 or to care for a loved one who has it. Messages that scare people can positively change their personal attitudes, intentions and behaviors, but if you are going to share scary information to highlight the danger of the pandemic, it’s helpful to also tell people what specific things they can do to reduce the threat. Emphasizing concrete, evidence-based actions that people can take may also feed into their motivation to share useful information.
Of course, none of these approaches is one-size-fits-all, and they are based on research that was conducted outside the context of this pandemic. Health messaging experts are working to determine what works to change behavior in our current situation — as well as what works for different communities. The science of persuasion does not yet have all the answers, and the effects of persuasion on behavior are often small; certainly, they cannot replace large-scale government action. Maybe you change only one mind with the messages you share. But that could still help bend the curve."

Justice Department attorney Hashim Mooppan urged the judges to stay out of “this political tug-of-war” that he said “risks damaging public confidence in the impartiality” of the court. A decision in the House’s favor, he said, would open the floodgates, allowing lawmakers to “come in and sue every time the executive branch exceeded its authority.”
Several judges suggested there were no limits to the Trump administration’s argument. If a president abused his powers, Judge Judith W. Rogers asked, does the Justice Department’s position mean “there’s nothing that can be done until the next presidential election other than revolution?”
In a series of hypothetical questions, Judge Merrick B. Garland asked whether the Justice Department’s view meant that presidents were free to fund the Affordable Care Act or send stimulus checks to all Americans without congressional approval.
“If the appropriations power can never be checked in a situation where the government just gives money away either for health care or for maintenance, that’s a significant power that the president has that can’t be checked by Congress,” Garland said.
House General Counsel Douglas Letter asked the judges not to “close the courtroom doors” to lawmakers who are trying to preserve their constitutional oversight and spending authority and to “help prevent the executive from becoming a monarch.”
Underscoring the significance of the cases, the court was sitting with a complement of nine judges instead of the usual three-judge panel. The consolidated arguments were held by teleconference as the court’s doors have been largely closed to the public since mid-March because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The full appeals court agreed last month to reconsider the dismissal of the two lawsuits brought by House Democrats, marking a temporary victory for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The decisions will probably be appealed to the Supreme Court.
Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao did not participate Tuesday. Both were nominated by the president and previously held high-level positions in the Trump administration.
In the first case, a divided three-judge panel of the appeals court in February said it had no authority to resolve a “bitter political showdown” over the House Judiciary Committee’s subpoena for testimony from McGahn.
In a court filing this month, House lawyers said McGahn’s testimony is still relevant to ongoing oversight. His testimony will help the Judiciary Committee decide whether Trump “committed impeachable offenses” in former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation and “whether to recommend new articles of impeachment.”
The lawsuit was filed before the House opened impeachment proceedings and voted in December to impeach Trump for his alleged effort to pressure Ukraine to conduct investigations that would benefit his reelection campaign. The Senate voted to acquit Trump on Feb. 5.
Trump had blocked McGahn’s testimony, saying the key presidential adviser was “absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony” and could not be forced to answer questions or turn over documents.
Mooppan, representing the Trump administration, said Tuesday that lawmakers can use other political tools to compel the White House to cooperate. But several judges took issue with alternatives such as a federal government shutdown, impeachment or sending the House sergeant at arms to arrest a noncompliant executive official.
“Does it matter at all how proportionate and practicable those available remedies are?” Judge Cornelia T.L. Pillard asked. She questioned whether the House should have to resort to “huge, blunt, disproportionate nuclear options” to exercise its oversight.
In the second case, the court is considering whether the House has legal grounds to sue the Trump administration over the diversion of billions of dollars to build a border wall near Mexico.
The dispute over border wall spending between Congress and the administration prompted the longest government shutdown in history. The stalemate ended in 2019 with Congress allocating about $1.4 billion for enhanced security along the border in Texas, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump had requested.
The House lawsuit claims Trump violated the Constitution by ignoring the spending limits imposed by Congress and diverting more than $6 billion allocated for other purposes to fund the wall. He invoked statutes he said allowed him to repurpose appropriations — a move House Democrats say upended Congress’s essential check on the president and its power of the purse.
The House position attracted support from a long list of former lawyers for past House speakers from both parties and from a bipartisan group of more than 100 former members of Congress.
Justice Department lawyers told the appeals court Tuesday a single chamber of Congress cannot sue the administration because the power to appropriate federal funds is assigned to Congress as a whole.
Judge Thomas B. Griffith appeared to embrace that argument, asking the House lawyer: “Isn’t it pretty clear that you need to have the Senate with you right now to bring this suit?”
In June, a District Court judge also sided with the Justice Department and dismissed the House lawsuit."

A bit later the “adaptive” immune system with Y-shaped antibodies goes after the virus. The adaptive immune system has a memory, in case the invading virus returns. This vital process holds a key to managing the pandemic in the coming months, but there is plenty of uncertainty.
The presence of antibodies after infection can help identify people with immunity, paving the way for reopening workpaces and schools, helping front-line health-care workers determine who is and is not at risk, and showing epidemiologists how far the virus has spread. In the longer term, antibodies can show if populations have developed what is known as a herd immunity, a margin of immune individuals that would make it hard for the virus to replicate and spread.
But there are questions galore over who has antibodies and how much this virus leaves behind. To find out requires antibody or serological tests. The antibody test looks at whether the person has been infected, while diagnostic tests check for currrent infection. Antibody tests are flooding the market but have limitations and unreliability. They have never been tried on such a mass scale. The World Health Organization said April 24 that there is “no evidence” that people with coronavirus antibodies are immune from reinfection, but after some confusion about the statement, the agency clarified that “we expect that most people” will develop antibodies to provide “some level of protection.”
On March 16, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would permit manufacturers to sell serological tests without prior FDA review as long as the makers determined the tests were accurate and reliable, notified the FDA and labeled the tests as not approved by the agency and not for diagnostic use. There are now more than 90 antibody tests on the market, and many of them are shoddy and inaccurate. Inaccurate tests could lead people to make bad decisions — life-and-death choices. The Infectious Diseases Society of America says that “no universal standard for reporting” exists, and some tests measure the quantity of antibodies, while others determine only yes or no.
The FDA has a separate channel for emergency use authorization, which reguires a more rigorous check; only four tests have been so approved.
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the agency is trying to balance risks and benefits. In retrospect, the balance went too far in opening the door to unreliable tests. Mr. Hahn is warning that people should be “very cautious” when using serological tests not backed by the FDA emergency use authorization.
As a tool, serology can help sort out the immunity of individuals and survey the population as a whole. Hopefully, researchers at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health will be successful with an urgent project to identify which serological tests are accurate, and clear the field of those that are not. The mission is too critical for anything less."

I agree with Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) that we have a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to not just reopen our city, but to build a more equitable DC.”
As one of the most intensely gentrifying cities in the nation, the District cannot afford for this crisis to further fuel displacement. The D.C. Council has passed impressive measures protecting residents during this unprecedented time. But substantial gaps remain. The District must do all it can to ensure that homeowners and tenants do not suffer the trauma, wealth loss and displacement of foreclosure and eviction in the midst of a pandemic. Surprisingly, the District has yet to enact any moratorium on foreclosures as part of its coronavirus response, putting it behind states such as South Carolina and Indiana. Its eviction moratorium has been in place since March but lags behind states such as Kansas and Kentucky in its coverage because new eviction cases can still be filed in court — indeed, over 1,000 have been filed since mid-March. As part of its next emergency legislation, the council must pass — and the mayor and attorney general should support — a full moratorium on foreclosures and evictions. To build a more equitable District, we need to hit pause on these engines of displacement until we have a comprehensive strategy for an equitable recovery."
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-missed-an-opportunity-to-prove-himself-governors-show-it/2020/04/28/b1c5999e-8958-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html,The Washington Post,Trump missed an opportunity to prove himself. Governors show it.,"When the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination got underway last year, there were four current or former governors in contention.
Three of them — Steve Bullock (Mont.), Jay Inslee (Wash.) and John Hickenlooper (Colo.) — didn’t last as far as the first contest in Iowa. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts hung in longer, though it wasn’t clear many Americans were even aware he was running.
Maybe the problem was that competence seemed, well, boring. The pragmatism and managerial ability that it takes to run a state successfully were not qualities that voters seemed to find appealing in this divisive and partisan political environment.
Not, that is, until the coronavirus came along. A new Washington Post-University of Maryland poll is the freshest evidence that governors have emerged as the heroes of the deepest national crisis in recent memory.
Sure, there have been scattered protests outside of capitols across the country as conservative activists have sought to generate a backlash against state-issued stay-at-home orders. But the Post-U. Md. survey found that an astounding 77 percent of Americans view their governor’s response to the pandemic, which has killed more than 57,000 Americans thus far, as “good” or “excellent.”
The poll number had grown by five percentage points in the past week alone and was consistent across party lines. For Democrats, Republicans and independents to find they agree upon anything is the rarest — and most welcome — of situations these days.
Trump’s numbers, by comparison, are underwater. A little more than half of those surveyed — 52 percent — rate his handling of the covid-19 crisis as “not so good” or “poor.” And he continues to be viewed through a partisan lens, with 90 percent of Republicans giving his performance a positive grade and only 17 percent of Democrats and 45 percent of independents feeling that way.
The Post poll was conducted between April 21 and 26, which means most of the responses were collected before Trump made the bizarre and dangerous suggestion last Thursday that injecting people with disinfectant might cure the virus. If the question were asked today, his rating would probably be even lower.
White House officials are saying they plan to refocus the president in the days to come, and that he will be talking more about the economy and strategies for reopening the country. But we’ve heard them say things like this before and know that these kinds of pivots tend to last only until the next time something on Fox News sets Trump off.
One thing that the upsurge in regard for the governors reveals is that Trump has missed what might have been a golden opportunity to change the negative perception that most Americans have of him. “Crises are a test for executives, and executives can rise or fall during a crisis,” says Jared Leopold, a former spokesman for both the Democratic Governors Association and Inslee’s presidential campaign.
In moments when people’s lives or livelihoods are in peril, there is also a well-documented “rally ’round the flag” effect in which all but the most rock-hard partisans are willing to suspend their doubts for a bit and put their faith in the leaders they must depend upon to get them out of the situation.
But then those leaders have to perform. Governors such as Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.), Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), Inslee and Larry Hogan (R-Md.) have been decisive, fact-driven and empathetic. “We have to act as our logical selves here,” Cuomo said in his midday briefing Tuesday.
Trump, alas, has shown none of those qualities. At the outset, he denied that the virus was a serious threat. Since then, he has acted as if all of this is a reality show: lashing out when he is asked reasonable questions, crowing about the television ratings of his briefings, touting achievements that haven’t happened,and filling his Twitter feed with grievances and attacks on his adversaries.
In other words, Trump has behaved pretty much the way he always does. In normal times, these traits might be shrugged off as “a harmless joke, but now, his incompetence is deadly serious,” says former (and possibly future) Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D).
There is some reassurance in the fact that governors of both parties are reminding us what rational and credible leadership looks like. There are still some grown-ups in charge, which is something that Americans of all political stripes are learning to appreciate once again."
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/04/28/democrats-want-to-let-millions-more-americans-use-their-food-stamps-at-restaurants/,The Washington Post,Democrats want to let millions more Americans use their food stamps at restaurants,"A bill introduced in Congress on Tuesday would expand an underused part of the food stamps program to help feed millions of out-of-work Americans while assisting restaurants across the country that are struggling to survive a pandemic that has dramatically reduced their revenues or shut them down altogether.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.) introduced legislation in their respective chambers to expand the Restaurant Meals Program, a little-known initiative that allows seniors, disabled and homeless people to use their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to purchase discounted restaurant meals because these folks often can’t cook for themselves or don’t have access to a kitchen. The RMP is voluntary for states, and to date, only about three use the program, including California, Arizona and Rhode Island. The low participation rate, in part, reflects the public health concern that fast-food chains would mostly sign up for the program, affecting the well-being of the people who receive benefits, Murphy said.
But as the unemployment rate swells, as grocery store shelves grow more depleted and as public transportation continues to pose a threat for low-income Americans who need it to visit supermarkets, states have been looking to SNAP for solutions. Governors in Louisiana and Texas have both said they would like to see the RMP expanded to feed their citizens and to bolster the hobbled hospitality industry. This month, several groups, including the National Council of Chain Restaurants and the National Restaurant Association, wrote to the U.S. Agriculture Department to recommend that Secretary Sonny Perdue open the RMP to more SNAP recipients and more restaurants.
“The Restaurant Meals Program has been serving SNAP participants in a few states and counties for many years, but despite the value that this program has to the people it serves, its reach has been limited,” the groups wrote in the letter. “Expanding food access to meet the urgent need is possible, but will require action by the department, and quickly.”
The proposed legislation — the SNAP Covid-19 Anti-Hunger Restaurant Relief for You Act of 2020, or the SNAP Carry Act — would do just that. During a public health emergency or a declared national disaster, the legislation would widen the Restaurant Meals Program to, theoretically at least, all 38 million people who already receive SNAP benefits. It would also make it easier for states and food retail businesses to participate. States would still need permission from the USDA to join the program, but Perdue would have the authority to waive a stipulation requiring that an agency (and sometimes a state) official visit a restaurant before it can participate.
“I had never heard of the Restaurant Meals Program until the beginning of this current crisis,” Murphy told The Washington Post. “I was doing research in February and March, looking for creative ways to get food to people in need, and I came across California’s experience with the Restaurant Meals Program.
“It struck me immediately as a win-win: as a way to give more people access to more food options and a way to bring revenue into restaurants. There are very few no-brainers in federal policy these days, and this seemed to be one of them,” the senator added.
The National Restaurant Association quickly threw its weight behind the legislation.
“In this unprecedented moment in history, restaurants want to continue to support their communities as an essential part of the food supply chain,” said Sean Kennedy, the group’s executive vice president of public affairs. “We applaud the introduction of the SNAP Carry Act, and look forward to working alongside anti-hunger groups to ensure that all people, including those that participate in SNAP, have as many food access points as possible during times of crisis.”
Before filing the bill, Murphy said he tried to work through Perdue and the USDA to implement the necessary changes, but he never heard back. The Trump administration has given mixed signals about its commitment to the SNAP program in recent months: In December, the administration finalized rules to tighten work requirements for SNAP, potentially cutting hundreds of thousands of people from the program. But this month, Perdue announced an emergency package that would increase SNAP benefits by $2 billion per month.
Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, which oversees that SNAP program, did not immediately respond to an email for comment. But Murphy said he knows his bill will face resistance in the Republican-controlled Senate. It could also face intense lobbying from industries that might lose a portion of their SNAP money, such as convenience stores or supermarkets.
“A Republican Senate is not looking to do a lot of favors these days for people who are on SNAP benefits,” Murphy said. “But there are a lot of Republican senators who want to help restaurants, and this bill helps people who are hungry, but it also creates a whole bunch of new customers for restaurants. So I think that angle will attract Republican support.”
An expanded RMP could also be another tool — along with loans and grants, limited carryout and delivery services and public donations — that may help restaurants navigate their way through the coronavirus pandemic. In the past, the limited pool of SNAP customers (seniors, homeless and disabled people) probably wasn’t large enough to entice more restaurants (other than fast-food chains and the like) to participate in the program. But with potentially millions more SNAP recipients taking part in an expanded RMP, it would likely attract a “wide variety” of restaurants that need the extra revenue, Murphy said.
Panetta represents the central coast of California — including the Salinas Valley, the “Salad Bowl of the World” — where agriculture is the region’s top industry. More than 9 percent of the households in the area also receive SNAP benefits, according to the senator’s office.
“With so many Americans struggling with hunger and so many restaurants struggling to remain in business during this pandemic, we must do everything we can to ensure that people can eat and those businesses can stay open. We can help achieve those objectives by allowing people to use their SNAP benefits to purchase low-cost prepared meals from restaurants,” Panetta said in a statement to The Post. “The legislation really is a common-sense strategy to provide more options to food insecure individuals while simultaneously helping our food service industry.”"
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/metoo-is-on-the-democratic-foot-what-does-that-mean-for-november/2020/04/28/87734be8-8997-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html,The Washington Post,"On Biden and the Tara Reade allegation, do our normal standards apply?","It’s hard to remember a time when America was able to worry about something other than the novel coronavirus, but if you cast your mind back to September 2018, you will recall that America spent three dramatic weeks weighing accusations that then-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh had, while in his teens, assaulted Palo Alto psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Act 1 of that drama had actually taken place years before, when President Bill Clinton was accused of carrying on with a White House intern. Then came Kavanaugh, and for Act 2, nearly everyone reversed their previous position on official sexual misconduct.
You may recall, hazily, how adamantly Democrats insisted that this sort of thing should utterly disqualify a man from higher office. When Republicans confirmed Kavanaugh anyway, the left erupted with incandescent, implacable rage. Even a year later, Slate’s legal reporter, Dahlia Lithwick, wrote that she refused to go back to the Supreme Court, that with Kavanaugh on the court, “none of us, as women, were ever going to be perfectly safe again.”
If there was one good thing to come out of that mess, it was that Democrats rethought expedient embraces of sexual abusers. “I was wrong” editorials were penned; progressives insisted that from now on, #MeToo would override realpolitik.
And now, Act 3: The shoe of the accused is back on a Democratic foot.
Tara Reade, who worked for Joe Biden in the early 1990s, has alleged that the then-senator pushed her up against a wall and groped her very intimately. Initially, this allegation could be, and was, brushed off as less than credible. Reade has changed her story over time, and some of the details raised eyebrows of older women, who wondered how anyone working in an office back then could have gotten away without wearing pantyhose to work. So for a brief time it was viable to insist that the distinction was not the politics of the accused but the credibility of the accuser.
But now it looks very likely that Reade’s mother called in to CNN’s Larry King in 1993, when the attack is alleged to have taken place, to complain that her daughter had been forced to leave a senator’s office because of his misbehavior, although she mentioned only unspecified “problems.” A former neighbor of Reade’s has emerged to say that Reade told her about the attack in the late 1990s, with much the same description that Reade gives today. This is far more corroboration close to the time of the alleged event than Ford ever had.
That doesn’t, of course, mean Biden did it. Moreover, even if you find Reade credible, it is perfectly defensible to vote for Biden anyway, as I myself am planning to do come November.
For example, one might argue that we should not make political decisions based on accusations this old, unless there is credible evidence of a pattern that continued long afterward. Once decades have passed, it becomes impossible to evaluate such accusations fairly, because too many memories and records have been lost. The verdict ends up resting too much on one’s subjective evaluation of the accuser’s credibility, and such evaluations are inevitably colored by one’s prior opinion of the accused.
That would have been a very good position to take on Kavanaugh, not just because there was so little solid evidence. A decent society allows for rehabilitation, and when we cannot get clear evidence of a crime, then if there’s no evidence of later wrongdoing, we should err on the side of hoping that either the accuser was mistaken or the offender has reformed.
But if you insisted that Kavanaugh must go, it’s hard to argue for mercy now without saying the painful words “I was wrong.” Alternatively, Biden’s supporters can insist that such accusations should disqualify you for higher office, no matter how old or uncorroborated, while noting that in this election, they have no candidate who hasn’t been accused of sexual assault — in Trump’s case, by numerous women.
Yet how many of the people grasping at this defense would actually vote for Trump — or any Republican — if only it weren’t for those allegations? The answer is probably close to zero. Republicans are hoping that Democrats will make their hypocrisy explicit; in fact, they believe Democrats already have.
That’s probably a fair accusation in many cases. But Republicans who are certain they’ve caught Democrats in a double standard should ask whether normal standards really should apply during a dire crisis such as the current pandemic. For even if I didn’t believe in a mercy standard for decades-old crimes, I’d still argue that however important it is to protect victims of abuse, protecting them very much includes getting the Republic out of the hands of our current fool of a president."
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/28/trump-coronavirus-economy-reopen-meat/,The Washington Post,Push to reopen economy runs up against workers and consumers worried about risk,"Plans for a swift reopening of malls, factories and other businesses accelerated Tuesday, but they quickly collided with the reality that persuading workers and consumers to overlook their coronavirus fears and resume their roles in powering the U.S. economy may prove difficult.
President Trump on Tuesday evening issued an executive order that gives the federal government broad powers to ensure that meat and poultry processing plants remain open during the pandemic. The move, designed to avert widespread food shortages, came after the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence had plunged to its lowest mark in six years.
In the absence of a federal mandate, states are adopting varying approaches to the speed and pace of their commercial revivals. During a White House meeting with Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said he would make an announcement Wednesday on his state’s reopening plans.
Businesses in Georgia — including massage centers and barbershops — began welcoming customers Friday for the first time since Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issued a mandatory shelter-in-place order on April 2. And in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is allowing certain businesses, including retailers, restaurants and movie theaters, to reopen at the end of the week, but at only 25 percent capacity.
After several weeks of a comprehensive economic pause, companies, workers and consumers are returning to a changed landscape. The steady growth and low unemployment that Americans enjoyed just two months ago have vanished. Hanging over plans to restart the nation’s economic engine are unprecedented health concerns, as individuals balance each shopping trip, airplane flight and restaurant meal against the risk of catching a sometimes-fatal illness.
“Consumers may have permission to go do something. But whether they go do it depends upon how badly they want to do it and how safe they feel,” said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business.
At the White House, Trump sought to look beyond the deepening recession that economists say is pushing unemployment higher than at any time since the Great Depression. He said July, August and September would bring a “transition” to a stronger rebound in the weeks before and after the November election.
“I think [the] fourth quarter's going to be incredibly strong. I think next year is going to be an unbelievably strong year,” the president told reporters.
His upbeat remarks came just hours before the Commerce Department was expected to report Wednesday that the economy contracted at its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2008, when the global financial crisis was gathering steam.
“It is going to be the worst we’ve seen, probably,” said Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, calling the situation “temporary.”
Sustained improvement now depends upon wooing workers and consumers to return to factories, restaurants and shops. There already are signs that it may not be easy.
After 20 meatpacking plants closed in recent weeks following covid-19 outbreaks, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union complained about unsafe working conditions. A worker at a Smithfield Foods plant in Missouri sued the company in federal court, saying it had failed to take action to protect its employees, including altering operations to permit social distancing, providing protective gear and encouraging sick employees to stay home.
The New Braunfels, Tex., restaurant where Olivia Wise, 22, works as a waitress is planning to reopen Friday, when the state begins allowing some businesses to operate at 25 percent capacity. But the young woman, who lives with her parents, doesn’t feel comfortable going back just yet.
“I personally think it’s still too soon,” she said. “It’s awesome they want to get the economy going again, but it’s not worth risking getting my parents sick.”
Consumers, too, do not appear to be in any rush to leave home. While there have been scattered protests of lockdown orders in a handful of states, the current limits on activity draw solid public support. In a new Washington Post poll, 66 percent of respondents — including 62 percent of Republicans — agreed that existing limits on restaurants, stores and businesses were “appropriate,” while just 17 percent said they were too restrictive.
A key test of consumer willingness to brave health fears will come as soon as Friday, when Simon Property Group, the nation’s largest mall owner, plans to reopen more than four dozen properties in 10 states, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC.
In another sign of returning normalcy, Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson told investors Tuesday that he expects to have about 90 percent of all company-owned stores open by early June.
The administration’s hopes for a swift V-shaped recovery are clouded by the danger that a premature reopening might result in a new surge of infections, which would require some states to order a second shutdown. Besides testing public compliance, such an order could interrupt supply chains.
“This is what matters. The risk is you’ve got to shut down again,” said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist for TS Lombard.
Washington is fighting the pandemic on all fronts. The Federal Reserve and Congress are devoting a combined $9 trillion in aid to saving the wounded economy, according to Kudlow.
Progress so far has been easier to detect in financial markets, which have rebounded from their late-March lows and sometimes disorderly trading, than in the lives of average Americans.
A closely watched index of consumer sentiment from the Conference Board fell sharply Tuesday to 86.9 in April from 118.8 in March. A separate measure of current conditions posted its sharpest fall ever, reflecting the massive rise in unemployment amid the pandemic-related shutdown, the group said.
Expectations for the next six months rose slightly, as consumers foresaw an end to mandatory business closures.
Millions of Americans have lost their jobs in recent weeks, forcing many families to rethink their spending habits. In Texas, Wise and her parents, who are also out of work, have spent the past six weeks whittling down their expenses by downgrading their cable plan, forgoing restaurant meals, and doing without new clothes and shoes.
“All of a sudden it was like, ‘Oh crap, what do we do? Nobody in this house has a job,’” said Wise.
Two weeks after she was laid off from her waitress job in mid-March, her father was furloughed from the fracking company where he worked. Both are receiving unemployment checks, but Wise says they’re not sure how long it will be until they can both work again. In the meantime, household expenses pile up.
“We’ve stopped spending money, not only because of the quarantine but because, finance-wise, we can’t afford it anymore,” she said. “We’re doing okay. We have food in the fridge, but you just can’t spend when you don’t know when things are going to go back to normal.”
Business owners say they also are facing a delicate balancing act, weighing the health of their employees against the need to make money. It wasn’t clear, many said, whether customers would even show up once they reopened, but they couldn’t risk staying closed if all of their competitors were open.
In Texas, Abbott’s quarter-capacity mandate has left business owners scrambling to determine how, and when, to restart operations, according to Jason Mock, president of the San Marcos Area Chamber of Commerce, near Austin.
“Everybody is still wrapping their hands around it,” he said. “There’s still hesitation among some businesses, but others are excited to get back in the game because they’ve been sidelined for so long.""
Some restaurant owners, he said, are wondering whether they can make ends meet with only one-quarter of their seats open to the public. Reopening this week means having to pay for food, utilities and employee wages, with little guarantee that diners will immediately venture back.
“It’s tough,” Mock said. “I think it’s probably going to be a slow trickle at first. But owners understand that this is just the first step on the way to how things used to be.""
At the Luggage Shop of Lubbock, which will reopen Friday, owner Tiffany Zarfas Williams says she is encouraging shoppers to opt for curbside pickup. If they want to shop in person, they can schedule a visit online to ensure that the store never gets too crowded. She’s also stocked up on disposable masks and hand sanitizer for employees as well as shoppers.
“I am a little nervous,” Williams said. “I hate being in the state that’s one of the first to reopen — we won’t know until two, three weeks from now whether this was a good idea.""
As her sales have fallen 90 percent in the past month, Williams has continued to pay her two full-time employees and managed to defer her store’s rent for two months. But she says she’s bracing for a long-term drop in business. It could be months, perhaps years, she says, before consumers feel comfortable spending hundreds of dollars on luggage.
“Even once we open, I don’t foresee people just rushing out of the door to shop,” she said. “It’s a challenging time for someone who owns a luggage and travel store. Those are two things nobody is thinking about right now, and I don’t know when that’s going to change. That’s what makes this so difficult: all of the uncertainty.”
In Columbia, S.C., Darius Johnson is preparing to reopen his music-themed smoothie shop Monday after a month-long closure that’s cost him thousands of dollars in lost sales. Johnson, who has four employees, plans to introduce a mobile app so customers can order and pay with their phones. He’s also stocking up on turmeric, ginger and lemon juice, in hopes that health-conscious consumers will be ready to shell out.
“It has been a really big challenge waking up each morning and knowing I’m not going to make a single dollar,” said Johnson, 28, who opened the Groove Smoothie & Juice Bar in November. “Of course, ultimately you want to stay safe, but you also have to do what you can to keep the business going.”"
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-justin-amash-to-seek-libertarian-party-nomination-for-president/2020/04/28/482b7de6-89b2-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html,The Washington Post,Rep. Justin Amash to seek Libertarian Party nomination for president,"Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan will seek the Libertarian Party’s nomination for president, ending months of speculation that the former Republican would run as an alternative to President Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
“Americans are ready for practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people,” Amash (I-Mich.) tweeted Tuesday evening. Two weeks earlier, he had tweeted that he was looking “closely” at a run, after denouncing a comment Trump made about presidential authority.
Amash, who turned 40 this month, was elected in the 2010 tea party wave and grew increasingly distant from Republicans as the decade went on, fending off a primary challenge from a business-backed conservative in 2014. He was deeply critical of Trump’s 2016 campaign, and even more critical of what the GOP did with control of the legislative and executive branches.
“Things have really taken a turn for the worse, in terms of the growth of libertarianism in Congress,” Amash told The Washington Post in a 2018 interview. “You have some bright spots here and there. But for the most part, the party’s become more nationalistic, more anti-trade.”
In 2019, Amash became the only Republican to call for Trump’s impeachment. Not long after, he left the party and continued to vote against spending bills, while opposing many White House priorities. He faced a tough reelection in his Grand Rapids, Mich.-based district, with Republicans and Democrats both filing against him.
At the same time, Amash faced pressure from members of the Libertarian Party to run for its nomination. The party hit a record high of nearly 4.5 million votes in 2016, with former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson leading the ticket. But there was no obvious favorite for this year’s nomination, with former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee ending his bid this month and former judge Jim Gray, the party’s 2012 nominee for vice president, probably their best-known candidate.
Johnson welcomed Amash’s candidacy.
“I think it’s terrific,” Johnson said in a text message. “I’d have to think that his candidacy will garner a lot of attention, which will be great for the Libertarian Party.”
It’s unclear whether a bid by Amash would have a greater effect on Biden or on Trump. In 2019, a Detroit News poll found Biden leading Trump in Michigan, a state that has grown more uncertain for the president, by 12 points. With Amash as an option, Biden’s lead shrunk to six points, with some independents and Republicans moving away from the Democrat. But national polling of Amash has been sparse, and it’s unclear how many states the Libertarian Party will attain ballot access in as the coronavirus pandemic makes traditional signature-gathering impossible.
The Libertarian Party is set to meet in Austin over Memorial Day weekend to pick its presidential nominee, with the convention making its choice on May 25. While the pandemic has canceled many political events, the Libertarian Party had not moved the convention, and earlier this week Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced that the state would “reopen” on May 1."
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/29/israel-nears-point-no-return/,The Washington Post,Israel nears a point of no return,"The coronavirus pandemic may be ravaging the world, but it proved the ultimate boon to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The public health emergency helped Netanyahu delay his corruption trial on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust until late May. And it created the pressures that enabled the wily prime minister to break the main opposition alliance against him, end the political paralysis that followed Israel’s third election in less than a year, and form the country’s 35th government with him, once more, at the head.
My colleagues reported last week on the complexity of the unity government forged between Netanyahu and former adversary Benny Gantz. “The painfully negotiated structure is both divided and multiplied, with power split between two hostile camps and the number of ministries inflated to create the largest bureaucracy in Israeli history,” they wrote. “Netanyahu and Gantz would rotate the prime minister’s role, with Netanyahu taking the first 18-month term. Each would serve as the other’s deputy, requiring parallel staffs and a second official state residence.”
Questions abound about the capacity of this team of rivals to govern and how Netanyahu’s trials will affect Gantz’s credibility. “From being the moral voice for the last 15 months by calling for the removal of an indicted prime minister, Gantz is now the indicted prime minister’s chief protector and defender,” wrote Haaretz columnist Anshel Pfeffer.
And then there is the question of annexation. Nestled in the agreement between Gantz and Netanyahu is a clause to advance plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, along with the historic river valley that borders Jordan, starting as soon as July 1. This has long been in the works: With the blessing of the Trump administration’s widely-derided “vision” for “peace and prosperity” in the region, Netanyahu and his allies in the Israeli right hope to extend Israel’s sovereignty over at least some of the 128 Jewish settlements that now dot the West Bank.
Such a move, while cheered by pro-settlers groups in Israel and President Trump’s evangelical base in the United States, may be a non-starter for Israel’s Arab neighbors and is staunchly opposed by much of the international community, foreign policy grandees in Washington and major voices in Israel’s security establishment.
“Unilateral annexation has the potential to ignite a serious conflagration,” read a letter addressed to Gantz, a former military chief himself, and signed by some 220 former high-ranking officers in Israeli security agencies. “Any partial annexation is likely to set in motion a chain reaction over which Israel will have no control, leading to the collapse of the Palestinian security agencies and of the Palestinian Authority. This, in turn, would require Israel to take full control over the entire West Bank, and assume responsibility for the lives of its 2.6 million Palestinians.”
That’s a scenario with troubling implications for those who want Israel to be a Jewish-majority and democratic state. “If there is no Palestine, Israel will be doomed to become a binational state rather than a Jewish one, or else adopt an apartheid system in which millions of Palestinians are ruled by Israel but lack full political rights,” noted Jackson Diehl, The Post’s deputy editorial page director.
But annexation is not yet a fait accompli. Gantz is “lukewarm” on annexation, said Daniel Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, in a virtual briefing held by the centrist Israel Policy Forum, though he added that it’s unlikely Gantz “could or even would throw himself in front of that train” when Netanyahu sets it in motion.
Still, Shapiro argued that the “actual implementation” of any form of annexation “is impossible without a very intense technical process,” one that may be difficult for the Israeli government to sort out before the U.S. presidential election in November — when Netanyahu may see Trump, who encouraged Israel down this path, defeated by a rival who would want to yank the prime minister back.
Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential hopeful and former vice president, has warned against annexation and Israel’s pursuit of policies that would jeopardize bipartisan support, especially from younger Democrats whose views of Israel have soured under Netanyahu’s long rule.
Critics on the left argue such consternation is too late. Trump’s predecessors, they say, didn’t do enough to halt the expansion of Israeli settlements or face up to the reality of Palestinian disenfranchisement that already exists.
“For decades on end, it was the international community that did not ‘miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity’ to make an actual difference, offering words but no action through years of feigned concern,” wrote Hagai El-Ad, executive director of B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group. “Now, once again, concern is being expressed over ‘preserving the eventual possibility of a two-state solution.’ It is difficult to imagine framing the matter in weaker, vaguer, or more ambiguous terms.”
Jeremy Ben-Ami, head of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel organization in Washington that supports a two-state solution, lamented how even Israel’s now much-diminished Labor party threw its lot in with Netanyahu, signaling the extent to which the political gravity is on the right.
“We are deeply disappointed that there hasn’t been a vocal opposition to what the government of Bibi Netanyahu is doing,” Ben-Ami told Today’s WorldView.
In the United States, it’s a different story. “For Democrats, the positions they are staking out” — particularly in opposition to annexation — “are the traditional bipartisan positions, the positions that Republican administrations used to take,” Ben-Ami said. But now, he added, Israel is no longer “outside the partisan maelstrom,” and has become for Republicans an object of America’s polarized culture wars.
“Between Netanyahu and Trump, they have made Israel a partisan wedge issue and are destroying decades of bipartisan support,” he said."
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ohio-primary-2020/2020/04/27/d0dd0bbc-88ba-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html,The Washington Post,Biden wins Democratic primary in Ohio; Rep. Joyce Beatty holds off challenge in 3rd district,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — Rep. Joyce Beatty held off a left-wing challenger and Joe Biden easily won the Democratic presidential contest in Ohio on Tuesday, in a contest delayed and held largely by mail due to the coronavirus pandemic.
On Monday, Ohio’s secretary of state said almost 2 million people had requested absentee ballots and just under 1.5 million had already voted. Only people with disabilities or who are homeless could cast provisional ballots Tuesday; others could drop off absentee ballots at Board of Elections offices.
A key contest was held in the state’s 3rd Congressional District, where Beatty (D), a four-term congresswoman, beat Morgan Harper, a former senior adviser at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Harper, 36, has been endorsed by Justice Democrats, the left-wing campaign corps that helped elect Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and that saw Harper as a star and Beatty as the sort of too-comfortable incumbent who could be vulnerable. It was the latest of several races that pit established Democrats against younger supporters of a Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all.
“The critique of many people, including my opponent, is that some of these ideas are pipe dreams,” Harper said in an interview Monday. “Really? We just greenlit billions of dollars to corporations. Why don’t we get to see some of that investment in our people?”
Beatty had not faced a primary challenge since winning the party’s nomination eight years ago and had spent more than $2 million on this race, more than her past three races combined. Harper raised more than $750,000 for her campaign.
In an interview, Beatty said she had tried to demonstrate “what real leadership is about” during the crisis, advocating for the district and sharing health and voting information. She criticized Harper for running without a long record in the district and pointed out that while Harper worked for the CFPB, the bureau’s former director, Richard Cordray, had endorsed the incumbent.
“I don’t know why someone would come out and make promises that are promises that she can’t keep,” Beatty said. “I’m not going to play a game of who can out-left one another. It’s about who can really stand up for the people and get things done.”
Beatty is now heavily favored to win the general election: The 3rd District, which includes most of Columbus and the suburbs, overwhelmingly backed former secretary of state Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in 2016, with Clinton taking 67 percent to Trump’s 29 percent.
The Justice Democrats, founded in 2017, endorsed a wide array of candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. In this cycle, it became more judicious, putting resources behind a handful of candidates in safely blue districts. In Texas, Justice Democrats-backed candidate Jessica Cisneros nearly ousted Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, while two weeks later activist Marie Newman unseated antiabortion Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.).
“We endorsed Morgan because of her career of service, the excitement she inspired in the grass-roots activist community, and because she rejected corporate donations that harm the Democratic Party,” said Alexandra Rojas, Justice Democrats’ executive director. “Like AOC has said, for one of us to get in, one hundred have to try.”
Because of the coronavirus outbreak, both Harper and Beatty were forced to cancel traditional campaigning and focus on getting voters to return absentee ballots. On Sunday, Beatty hosted gospel singers and colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus to argue that voters needed her experience.
“It would be a big loss for your district if she was not there,” Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), the chairman of the CBC, said on the live stream. “When you start talking about Congress, where seniority and effectiveness really matter, she is the one.”
Originally scheduled for March 17, the Ohio primary was abruptly postponed, and Gov. Mike DeWine (R) recommended that in-person voting be rescheduled to June 2. But after a chaotic series of events, the Ohio General Assembly eventually passed a bill setting Tuesday as the date for the vote-by-mail primary. Ohio remains under a stay-at-home order."

Kennedy addressed Americans’ anxiety about national lassitude at the end of eight years under President Dwight D. Eisenhower by mildly saying: “I believe we can do better.” Joe Biden, responding to national embarrassment about the least presidential president, can campaign on a modest theme: “Is this really the best we can do?”
This question answers itself, particularly concerning foreign policy. Fortunately for Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, events and his opponent are making this central to the 2020 election.
It is axiomatic that Americans’ preference regarding foreign policy is to have as little of it as possible. Hence most of this cycle’s Democratic presidential aspirants avoided reminding people that the world is a dangerous place. However, during the Feb. 25 debate in Charleston, S.C., Biden called China’s President Xi Jinping “a thug”: “This is a guy who doesn’t have a democratic-with-a-small-‘d’ bone in his body.”
Economist John Maynard Keynes supposedly said, “When the facts change, I change my mind.” Biden, citing new facts, including aggression against Hong Kong’s freedom and “a million Uighurs” in “concentration camps,” has jettisoned his 2016 talk of his “enhanced cooperation” with Xi. In 34 of Biden’s 36 Senate years, he was on the Foreign Relations Committee, which he chaired for four years. President Trump’s foreign policy judgments have ranged from the contemptible (siding with Vladimir Putin at Helsinki in 2018 against U.S. intelligence officials regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election) to the preposterous (“There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea”) to the weird (he and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un “fell in love” after exchanging “beautiful letters”).
Trump now wants to make relations with China central to this campaign. His rhetorical skills — probably honed where they evidently peaked, on grammar school playgrounds — are emulated by his campaign in references to “Beijing Biden.” Biden can, however, turn China to his advantage by showing Trump what a policy of national strength would look like.
Biden served in the Senate for a decade with Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), a liberal Cold Warrior who helped to make the Soviet Union’s human rights abuses costly to the regime. Today, Biden should speak forcefully against China’s arrests of Martin Lee, 81; Jimmy Lai, 71; Margaret Ng, 72; and other leaders of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement.
Biden can practice what he preaches about bipartisanship by associating himself with Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton’s measured but insistent support for an investigation into the possible role of a Wuhan, China, research laboratory in the coronavirus outbreak. And with former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley’s call to require U.S. universities to disclose China’s funding of their professors and research. Cotton questions the visas for people from China to pursue postgraduate studies here in advanced science and technology fields: If Chinese students want to study “Shakespeare and the Federalist Papers, that’s what they need to learn from America. They don’t need to learn quantum computing and artificial intelligence from America.”
In February, a senior adviser for the World Health Organization’s director general praised China’s “bold approach” that “changed the course” of the epidemic. Indeed China did: Its first approach was to deny that there is human-to-human transmission. Biden should say that continued U.S. participation in this organization will be contingent upon its granting membership to Taiwan. Biden should also promise to discuss Taiwan’s exemplary response to covid-19 with Tsai Ing-wen in the Oval Office. She would be the first Taiwanese president welcomed in the United States since the 1979 “normalization” of U.S. relations with China.
By taking such steps, Biden can reconnect his party with its luminous post-1945 achievement. In that golden moment in the history of this nation’s engagement with the world, the talents of Dean Acheson, George Marshall, George Kennan, Averell Harriman, Robert Lovett, Charles Bohlen, John McCloy and others created the structures of free trade and collective military security that produced the related phenomena of global enrichment and Soviet collapse.
The winners of the past seven presidential elections (1992-2016) have averaged 330 electoral votes. If today’s state-by-state polls are correct, and if the election were held today, Biden would win 333 electoral votes: 232 from states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, plus those from Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
More than any particular policy outcome, Americans want a sense that their nation can regain the spring in its step, and can adopt a robust realism regarding the Leninist party-state that is its principal adversary. The first step toward a jauntier, safer America is to make the election a referendum on the right question: “Is this really the best we can do?”"
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/29/these-three-governors-are-reopening-their-states-faster-than-their-voters-want/,The Washington Post,These three governors are reopening their states faster than their voters want,"President Trump’s coronavirus task force recommends states begin reopening their economies only after 14 days in which progressively fewer covid-19 cases are diagnosed. Without any such downward trends, Republican governors in several Southern states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, have begun reopening their states.
Here’s how we did our research
What do the citizens of Georgia, Tennessee and Florida think of their governors’ plans? We just completed a multistate survey of public opinion about covid-19 designed, in part, to answer this question. We surveyed 22,912 individuals across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including 535 people in Tennessee, 633 in Georgia and 803 in Florida. The survey was conducted April 17 to 24 by PureSpectrum via an online, nonprobability sample, with state-level representative quotas for race/ethnicity, age and gender. Our analyses reweighted our data using the same demographic characteristics.
We asked respondents when they thought the country should reopen the economy and resume business activity. Possible responses ranged from “immediately” to “after more than eight weeks.”
Citizens don’t think their states should reopen business yet
Figure: Katherine Ognyanova
Figure: Katherine Ognyanova
As you can see in the figure above, these governors’ constituents are in less of a hurry to reopen than are their governors. Across all three states, only 12 percent of respondents — or fewer — supported an immediate reopening. Sizable majorities in each state — between 57 and 60 percent — prefer to wait a month or more before reopening the economy. On average, residents in all three states preferred to wait four to six weeks.
Interestingly, despite our era of partisan polarization, Democrats and Republicans agree that it is too early to reopen — although Democrats, on average, prefer to wait a bit longer. In all three states, Democrats favor waiting about six weeks, while Republicans support waiting about four weeks.
Older Americans, women and African Americans want to wait longer
We find in all three states, communities that have been hit particularly hard by the virus — including African Americans and people age 65 or older — strongly supported reopening more slowly, although again, very few white respondents supported immediate reopening. Women, also — again across all three states — preferred to wait longer than men.
Citizens expect widespread infections
One reason Americans prefer to move more slowly than their leaders may be their expectations of widespread infections. In each of the three states, respondents estimated about 4 in 10 Americans, or about 131 million individuals, ultimately will be infected during the pandemic, a total approaching worst-case models by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Which leaders do they trust?
About 28 percent of respondents across the three states trust their state government “a lot.” However, both Democrats and Republicans trust experts far more: 47 percent for the CDC, 55 percent for scientists and researchers, and 68 percent for hospitals and doctors.
What do residents of these states think of their governors’ leadership? Overall, majorities of respondents in each state approve of their governor’s handling of the pandemic: 53 percent in Tennessee, 52 percent in Florida and 56 percent in Georgia. While these numbers look strong on their face, they are tepid compared with the numbers for many other governors. Across our surveys of all 50 states, on average, 65 percent of respondents approved of their governors’ handling of the crisis.
What we find here is that bad policy — at least, according to CDC guidelines — makes bad politics. Recent political science research suggests elected leaders are often surprisingly uninformed about what policies their constituents want. Our research suggests voters are listening to the experts. Governors may wish, in turn, to listen to their voters."
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/managing-money-for-the-wealthy-really-pays-off/2020/04/28/a2920198-8966-11ea-80df-d24b35a568ae_story.html,The Washington Post,Managing Money for the Wealthy Really Pays Off,"Sergio Ermotti is under no illusion. The chief executive officer of UBS Group AG said on Tuesday that the range of possible economic outcomes from the coronavirus crisis is too wide for any meaningful judgment about the future. Yet managing money for the wealthy may well be a winning strategy for bankers during the worst slump in decades. The Swiss bank is doing pretty well out of it, reporting a big jump in first-quarter profit.
Just as the lockdowns are hurting some parts of the economy more than others, Europe’s largest lenders will struggle to varying degrees. Most are grappling with mounting loan losses and some pressure on revenue. Things will get tougher for everyone.
UBS, the world’s leading wealth manager, might be in a less worrying place than some of its peers, however. Profit in the first three months of 2020 jumped 40% to $1.6 billion as rich individuals and institutional investors increased their trading with the firm.
What’s more, the bank set aside just $268 million for loans that may go bad. That’s much smaller than the provisions made by other large banks, but it reflects the modest size of the UBS loan book, made up largely of mortgages (sold to Swiss clients for the most part). Loans to its wealthy clients, which are mostly backed by securities, saw some margin calls in the quarter but losses were contained. Ermotti’s pivot to the rich looks shrewd.
Even if things don’t improve, UBS should cope. Losses on loans to oil companies would rise by $250 million if West Texas Intermediate crude prices stayed at $10. More generally, under the bank’s current model of economic stress, UBS would have another $470 million of charges if it assumed losses on healthy loans too. That’s manageable.
While trading activity is slowing and fee income will probably decline as clients sit on more cash, Ermotti didn’t cut UBS’s targets. In the first quarter, profitability as measured by return on common equity Tier-1 capital reached 17.7%. The bank aims for between 12% and 15%.
Elsewhere, the situation looks more bleak. Spain’s Banco Santander SA is setting aside 3.9 billion euros ($4.2 billion) for loan losses, cutting its profit by 82% in the quarter. Its diversification across 10 core markets from Brazil to Poland isn’t much of a shield in a global pandemic.
The Spanish bank’s exposure to small- and medium-sized businesses, and to consumer finance, isn’t helping. Loan-loss provisions have soared while business has nosedived. New consumer lending in Italy and Spain fell to between 10% and 20% of its usual level once the lockdowns kicked in.
Santander’s underlying return on tangible equity dropped to 11.1% in the quarter, well below its medium-term target of between 13% and 15%. Chairman Ana Botin had seemed confident that her bank could weather the crisis with a 5% decline in earnings in a V-shaped economic recovery; on Tuesday she said the bank would need to review its strategic targets.
Credit losses are also piling up at HSBC Holdings Plc, an Asia-focused European lender, which is taking its biggest charge for bad debt in almost nine years. Provisions of $3 billion in the first quarter led to a 51% slump in adjusted profit. HSBC set its range of potential credit losses for the year at between $7 billion and $11 billion. “Part science, part art,” is how HSBC’s chief financial officer described his effort to gauge likely credit losses.
The banks’ second-quarter earnings will provide a clearer picture of the winners and losers, and yet more lending support from regulators could soften the blows. But UBS’s expensive decision after the financial crisis to move away from capital-intensive lending and trading is paying off."
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/29/tammy-duckworth-is-bidens-safest-smartest-vice-presidential-pick/,The Washington Post,Tammy Duckworth is Biden’s safest — and smartest — vice presidential pick,"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is playing prevent defense. Biden is ahead of President Trump by six points in national polls and leads in swing states such as Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona. He doesn’t need to recapture the news cycle, retool his strategy or reinvent the wheel to beat Trump. He just needs to stay ahead and run out the clock.
So when Biden picks his running mate, he should simply try to minimize risk. Biden should stay away from big-name progressives such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), future superstars such as Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) or Georgian Stacey Abrams and swing-state saviors such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) or Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). Those candidates might net Biden some votes, but choosing them would also pose real risks to Biden’s campaign and to his agenda. The safest choice, and the one most able to bolster important parts of Biden’s message, is Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.).
Duckworth easily meets the basic requirements for the job. She served in the House for four years and has been in the Senate since 2017, giving her more congressional experience than Donald Trump or Barack Obama had when they were inaugurated. As a 52-year-old religiously unaffiliated Asian American, she would balance the ticket demographically. She’s plausible as commander in chief, an essential qualification given Biden’s age. And, like Biden, she’s neither too liberal nor too moderate — data-driven measures place her right in the middle of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
And more than that, adding Duckworth to the ticket would also fill in some of the gaps in Biden’s experience while amplifying his vision. Biden constantly touts his foreign policy experience, but he has never served in the military. Duckworth is a combat veteran who lost her legs in the Iraq War, and as vice president, she would be able to provide a soldier’s firsthand perspective on war in the Middle East. More broadly, her time in the military would underscore Biden’s emphasis on service and sacrifice, especially at a moment when Trump’s handling of the pandemic has raised questions about how he treats members of the armed services.
This isn’t the only area where Duckworth’s personal story and political experience would make her a formidable addition to the ticket. As the Biden administration tackles issues such as paid family leave, Duckworth could provide a crucial combination of legislative know-how and firsthand personal experience as a relatively new parent to make the case for the administration’s proposals.
And simply as a matter of tactics, Duckworth’s status as a veteran and a mom would help her blunt the criticisms that are often aimed at female politicians. Her time in the military will make it hard for opponents to paint her as sentimental or purely emotional, while her status as a working mother would help some voters relate to her.
In addition to these assets, Duckworth doesn’t bring with her an obvious downside of the sort that plague her competitors.
If Biden picked a progressive like Warren, she could electrify the base — or drive away the swing voters and persuadable Republicans that Biden needs to win. Harris would be an asset on the campaign trail, but President Trump would constantly replay clips of her demolishing Biden on the Democratic debate stage. Abrams doesn’t have traditional presidential qualifications, and that’s a huge liability for someone who needs to back up a candidate as old as Biden. Klobuchar and Baldwin could deliver Midwestern votes, but they would leave their purple-state Senate seats vulnerable to Republican takeover. And Whitmer is a risky choice — nobody knows how popular (or unpopular) she will be once the coronavirus crisis is over, and with it her efforts to keep Michigan voters at home.
Duckworth, by contrast, doesn’t have any of that baggage.
She’s not a hardcore progressive. She didn’t spend the better part of 2019 making the case against Biden. Maybe most importantly for Biden’s ability to actually pass legislation, her Senate seat would be safe. If she became vice president, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) would appoint her replacement, and that candidate would likely win his or her next election.
And that’s why Biden needs her. Biden doesn’t need to give voters reasons to vote for him: Trump has already done that by presiding over a disastrous first term. He needs to make sure Americans don’t find reasons to vote against him. A Biden-Duckworth ticket would emphasize Biden’s key selling points without taking on any new risks. Duckworth would help Biden stay the course and stay ahead in this race — which is exactly what he needs."

Since the economic crisis began with the coronavirus pandemic, he has shifted some of his stances leftward, calling for trillions of dollars more in stimulus spending and complaining about big banks getting a federal bailout while some small businesses were unable to secure life-saving loans. He’s agreed to create several policy task forces that join his staff with Bernie Sanders’s, and has adopted small pieces of Elizabeth Warren’s agenda, and says he’s willing to hear more.
To key progressive groups and leaders, the steps he’s taken are a good start. But they’re still worried that once in office, his economic recovery plan will mirror that of President Barack Obama, which they believed betrayed the values he campaigned on and favored banks and Wall Street at the expense of workers.
Biden is walking a tightrope. He desperately needs to raise money from Wall Street and other centers of wealth and power, and he’s promised donors that their standard of living won’t change if he is in the White House. But he also fears a repeat of 2016, when progressives felt ignored by nominee Hillary Clinton and stayed away on Election Day, which many say contributed to Donald Trump’s victory.
The economic crisis, including unemployment of around 20%, has made voters’ more willing to support some of the progressives’ big ideas. A majority of Americans surveyed in late March favored increased spending on health care, the elderly, environmental protection, education and infrastructure, among other areas. That gives Biden room to maneuver to the left.
But the Democratic establishment rallied around the former vice president as their preferred nominee in early March in part to blunt fears that a progressive nominee like Sanders or Warren would espouse policy ideas that wouldn’t win in November.
His balancing act might be working. This week, Biden won endorsements from both Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, the chairwoman of the Progressive Caucus and from Clinton.
Progressive groups, however, say they’re going to push for more, demanding that Biden bring more like-minded voices into his campaign and his possible transition team. And they say they will loudly complain when he makes moves they oppose. They’ve made good on that pledge, sparking an uproar when Bloomberg News reported that Biden was getting economic advice from former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.
“Progressives are ready to be a resource to the Biden team -- and give them a good push if needed,” said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Institute.
A “Biden do not reappoint” list published by the American Prospect includes many of the same Obama administration alumni who progressives don’t want to see in a Biden administration, including Summers, former U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, and former Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag and Jeff Zients, an acting director and economic adviser.
There will also be objections if Biden hires from investment banks, private equity firms or other financial institutions and progressives say that he, like Obama, should bar corporate lobbyists from his transition team and administration.
Eight groups representing young progressives wrote to Biden with a list of personnel recommendations and have asked that he “pledge to appoint zero current or former Wall Street executives or corporate lobbyists, or people affiliated with the fossil fuel, health insurance or private prison corporations, to your transition team, adviser roles, or cabinet.”
No Medicare for All
Biden has made clear his leftward steps only go so far. He says he’s not going to adopt Medicare for All or the full Green New Deal. If he’s elected, no set of senior administration officials is going to look the same as it would in a Sanders or Warren administration, his campaign says.Still, Biden’s team is actively stressing to progressives that there’s plenty they’ll like about his campaign and, if elected, his administration.
Biden appointees “won’t be guided by a market fundamentalism that guided even Democratic economic teams in past administrations because the times have changed in that regard,” said Jared Bernstein, Biden’s former chief economist in the White House who is, like Summers, an informal adviser to Biden’s campaign.
“The optimal team has people with different views in the room and gets the balance right,” he said.
While progressives like Bernstein were outnumbered during the Obama years, Bernstein said he believes Biden will build “a much more balanced group with an ample supply of established progressive economists who recognize the importance of the leftward movement in the party in areas of labor power, trade, fiscal policy and deficits, minimum wages, health care and family supports.”
“Personnel and a policy agenda go hand-in-hand,” said Steph Sterling, vice president for advocacy and policy at the progressive Roosevelt Institute, which has ties to Warren and worked closely with Hillary Clinton’s team in 2016. Biden, she said, should select aides who believe in “the power of the government to reshape and reform markets instead of reinforcing and exacerbating extractive corporate power.”
Although Biden has adopted the centrist mantle, Bernstein said he has always favored working-class Americans over the wealthy and powerful. “I’ve heard concerns about the little guy and gal getting left behind and the unequal access of corporate power to Washington,” he said, adding that Biden called him last week to express concern that small businesses were missing out on loans from the Paycheck Protection Program.
Progressives say Bernstein is a reassuring presence, as is former Delaware Senator Ted Kaufman, Biden’s former Senate chief of staff and longtime friend, who worked aggressively for breaking up the big banks. Kaufman succeeded Warren as chair of the panel overseeing how stimulus money was spent after the 2008 recession and is close to her. Biden told donors Monday he is talking to Kaufman about his transition team.
“Who do you think Joe Biden’s going listen to?” Kaufman asked. “What do you think is down deep in Joe Biden’s innermost instincts? Where do you think they are? Do you think they’re with the poor, disadvantaged, with people of color, with middle class people? Or do you think they’re with Goldman Sachs?”
To Kaufman, the answer is clear, but some progressives worry that the Biden campaign’s vagueness about his economic team and the news about Summers reinforced their concerns. “Larry Summers Is a Dead Albatross Around Joe Biden’s Neck,” read a headline Monday in the Nation, concluding that if the candidate “wants to prove his bona fides to progressives, he’ll have to cut his ties to Larry Summers.” Others have started a petition urging Biden to do just that.
Memories of Obama
Jeff Hauser, founder of the Revolving Door Project, which scrutinizes executive-branch appointees, said Biden has pushed for something Summers opposed under Obama -- a stimulus bill in the trillions of dollars.
“There is responsiveness to the progressive wing that’s encouraging,” he said.
Mike Lux, who was the Obama transition team’s liaison to progressives and worked on Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign, said he sees progressives continuing to push Biden -- and for good reason.“In past eras when a Democratic candidate won, there was, frankly, more trust,” Lux said, arguing that some progressives still feel stung from the experience of watching Obama, who they believed was closely aligned with them, take a different path once elected.
“When Rahm Emanuel was brought in as chief of staff and Summers” and Timothy Geithner “were appointed right away, it really shocked and depressed people,” he recalled. “And that experience combined especially with Elizabeth Warren preaching that ‘personnel is policy’ means people are thinking about it all differently now.”"
"April 29, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/29/amashs-run-is-bad-idea-is-he-relevant/,The Washington Post,Justin Amash’s run is a bad idea. But is he relevant?,"Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), the former Republican who has consistently called out President Trump for his grotesque constitutional violations and voted for impeachment, announced on Tuesday he was forming an exploratory committee to run for the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination. He declared that the country has been waiting for someone like him:
Amash’s chances of winning the presidency are nonexistent, but the question on political watchers’ minds is: Who is helped by this quixotic run? The Post notes: “In 2019, a Detroit News poll found Biden leading Trump in Michigan, a state that has grown rockier for the president, by 12 points. With Amash added as an option, Biden’s lead shrunk to six points, with some independents and Republicans moving away from the Democrat.” Morning Consult, however, found in national polling that Biden leads Trump by the same margin with or without Amash in the race.
Many NeverTrump Republicans who have been working doggedly to defeat Trump do not like the idea of an Amash run one bit. This month, the Bulwark’s Sarah Longwell and Tim Miller wrote: “Could we be certain that a third-party campaign from a Constitutional conservative would not help Trump get reelected? The answer, unfortunately, is no.” They looked at the large third-party vote totals in 2016 in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which were considerably larger than Hillary Clinton’s margin of defeat, concluding, “For all the discussion about the voters who switched from [Barack] Obama to Trump — and turnout decline in urban areas — Hillary Clinton could have won the White House simply by getting a minority share of the voters who hadn’t historically voted third party, but in 2016 decided to throw their hands up.”
Prominent Republicans who have formed the Lincoln Project to endorse former vice president Joe Biden panned Amash’s decision:
First, Amash announced only an exploratory committee, so a failure to garner money or support might deter him. Recall that independent Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, got such a putrid reception that he never launched his presidential race. Given the immediate reaction among people who would be Amash’s target audience (disillusioned Republicans), Amash could reach the same conclusion.
Second, there is no guarantee that Amash would win the Libertarian nomination, which is set to hold its convention in late May in Austin. (It is unclear whether the coronavirus would prompt a cancellation or change in format.)
Finally, it’s quite possible Amash will not have much of an impact either way. In 2016, then-Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, who had been a governor and ran for president in 2012, was much better known than Amash. He drew 3.27 percent in the general election. There is no guarantee Amash would do even that well.
The worry for NeverTrump Republicans such as Longwell and Miller is that a third-party contender with some national profile would “tend to give those people who weren’t going to vote for Trump anyway an excuse to vote for someone else [other than the Democrat], while not pulling many voters from the Trump column.” In a razor-close race, Biden would need every single vote he can get, even from voters who dislike both him and Trump. (Trump carried those who disliked both him and Clinton in 2016 handily.)
Those who fear for the future of the republic are not anxious to make it any harder for Biden to win, and are in no mood to tolerate spoilers. Amash, who previously said he would not run unless he could win, is engaging in what amounts to a vanity campaign in an absolutely critical election. We hope he reconsiders."
"April 30, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/29/nearly-60000-americans-are-dead-trump-administration-says-its-great-success/,The Washington Post,"Nearly 60,000 Americans are dead. The Trump administration says it’s a great success.","While the Trump campaign would no doubt like to make November’s election about anything other than the novel coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying collapse of the U.S. economy, that will inevitably be the focus of the fall campaign. So how do you spin one of the most catastrophic presidential failures in U.S. history? Just listen to what the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, said on “Fox & Friends” Wednesday morning:
In this “great success story,” more than a million Americans have contracted covid-19 and 59,000 have died, far more than in any other country on earth. (And those are the official numbers; the real totals are almost certainly much higher).
Meanwhile, the key to both containing the virus and allowing us to safely resume economic and social activity — widespread testing that will allow us to identify and isolate those who carry the virus — has been an abysmal failure. Just this week, months after the pandemic began sweeping across the country, the administration finally got around to releasing a plan to increase testing, a plan that mostly tells states that it’s their responsibility. We’re still conducting only a fraction of the tests we need.
“I’m very confident that we have all the testing we need to start opening the country,” Kushner nevertheless told the Trump hype squad on “Fox & Friends.”
The president and those who work for him clearly believe that if they simply repeat over and over again that everything is going great, the public will believe it. They have other subsidiary arguments — no one could have predicted the arrival of a pandemic, it’s actually Barack Obama’s fault — but at the core is the contention that Trump’s leadership on the pandemic has been masterful and we should all be applauding his extraordinary performance.
This will be an excellent case study in the power of the president and his party to create an alternate reality. But there’s one reason it will be difficult: The administration doesn’t control the flow of information.
In other contexts, the president has had more power to fool the public — when he could exercise greater control over what they learned. For instance, when George W. Bush and his administration set about to convince the public that Saddam Hussein was about to attack us with his fearsome arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, that lie was challenging to disprove, at least for a while. It was difficult to see into Iraq much of the information even journalists were able to access came filtered through the very government that was mounting what turned out to be a spectacularly successful propaganda campaign.
But today, the Trump administration has no such control. We don’t need classified intelligence materials or brave whistle-blowers to know what’s happening with the pandemic. The daily death toll is available for anyone to see. We get reports from all over the country about hospitals that don’t have sufficient personal protective equipment, “essential workers” forced to do jobs that have become dangerous and the heartbreaking stories of lives lost.
Which is why the administration’s effort to convince us that this has been a smashing success aren’t working — though we have to be careful about what it means for this effort to “work.” Polls are showing approval for Trump’s handling of the pandemic similar to his approval ratings overall, in the 40s, which suggests that if Trump is your guy you’ll say he’s doing a good job, and if he isn’t, you won’t.
At the same time, state governors — especially those who have acted aggressively to impose lockdowns — have seen their approval shoot into the 70s or even 80s. Meanwhile, overwhelming majorities of the public in poll after poll reject the line being pushed by the administration that everything is under control and we’ll soon be able to resume normal activity. For instance, 79 percent of Americans in this poll believe a second wave of infections is likely, 80 percent in this poll say it’s a bad idea to reopen restaurants, and 82 percent in this poll say current restrictions are either appropriate or not strict enough.
Yet from now until November, the administration, the Trump campaign and Trump himself will continue to insist that his management of the pandemic has been positively awe-inspiring, no matter how high the death toll climbs. The media apparatus that supports him, centered on Fox News but also including conservative talk radio and web publications, will echo that claim.
They know that they don’t have to fool everyone. The experience of 2016 taught Trump that he could still win even if most Americans disliked him. At the end of that campaign, Gallup polls showed 61 percent of Americans with an unfavorable view of Trump (compared with 52 percent for Hillary Clinton). Yet a constellation of unpredictable factors enabled him to prevail in the electoral college even as Clinton got 3 million more votes.
Anyone with a commitment to reality might wish that at some point all Americans would agree that the president has failed and continues to fail, with tragic consequences. But that won’t happen. His supporters will close their eyes and insist that 2+2=5, the moon is made of green cheese and Trump has done a great job on this pandemic. They may not be a majority, but Trump is hoping there are just enough of them to keep him afloat."
"April 30, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/mark-levine-new-york-city-council/2020/04/29/028dbafe-8955-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html,The Washington Post,How a politician with no medical background came to be hyped as ‘the Anthony Fauci of the New York City Council’,"NEW YORK — Mark Levine, a member of the New York City Council and chairman of its health committee, dismissed early anxieties as ""fear mongering."" Then he and his wife fell ill.
In the weeks since their recovery from covid-19, Levine (D) has become one of the city’s most outspoken and occasionally polarizing figures, seizing on his newfound spotlight to make one of the most ambitious proposals in New York’s recent history: creation of a $1 billion Public Works Administration — but for public health.
The thought of resurrecting a Depression-era jobs program — Levine calls it the “Public Health Corps” — fits a pattern for the city councilor. As the mayor hesitated over whether to cancel the city’s St. Patrick’s Day parade, Levine pushed for closing restaurants and bars. “Bring hospital staff out of retirement,” he tweeted. “Cancel vacations. Allow docs to work in another specialty. This is wartime.”
He pushed for racial-disparity data, which captured the attention of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), among others in Washington. He publicly debated hospitals’ practice of turning away sick patients — and was scorched by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) for it. (The mayor called him “irresponsible, inaccurate and unfair,” although Levine was proved right.) And even as hospitalizations and deaths peaked, Levine was adamant that “every single measure of this pandemic is an undercount. Every. Single. One.”
Now, as city officials weigh how to reopen from a weeks-long shutdown, he has advocated reopening beaches as “a relief valve” — or, he warned, “we’ll have a dangerous level of lack of compliance on social distancing.”
With more than 157,000 confirmed novel coronavirus cases and 17,000 deaths as of Wednesday, New York City remains a global epicenter of the pandemic and joins the rest of the nation in a syzygy of possible turning points: growing calls for loosening restrictions, fears about the virus’s probable second wave, and piercing optimism about advances in vaccine development.
At this moment, the city’s 8 million residents — 21 percent of whom have been infected, according to estimates from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) — find themselves teetering on the precipice of either a recovery from the virus or a resurgence of it. And despite the triangulating swirl of barbs and bluster coming from City Hall, the governor’s office and the White House, the next steps taken here will be determined, by and large, by public health officials and those who oversee them.
A city council member since 2014, Levine, 50, has become to many this city’s unlikely pandemic political conscience. “Mark Levine has become the Anthony Fauci of the New York City Council,” said fellow council member Ritchie Torres (D), referencing the nation’s top infectious-diseases expert who is helping to guide the federal government’s response. “Like Fauci, he has a calm and cerebral approach that puts people at ease in a moment of crisis. Both colleagues and constituents look to Mark to guide them through complex issues surrounding covid-19.”
Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), whose congressional district includes Manhattan’s Harlem neighborhood, overlapping with Levine’s jurisdiction, agreed: “In this fight, he has kept his feet on the ground and asked for things that often don’t seem to be popular or part of the script but really make a lot of sense.”
Though his perspective is shaped in part by having been personally stricken by the virus — his wife experienced a 103-degree fever for 15 days, he said — Levine is not a doctor, and his political compass can do 180-degree turns. To de Blasio’s fury, he leaked the city’s dire contingency plan to use public parks as temporary burial sites, seemingly to provoke social distancing compliance and to highlight how deadly serious this pandemic had become. To even his allies’ bewilderment, he also advocated for the reopening of public beaches, a move widely criticized as reckless when it happened in Florida. (Asked what informed his viewpoint, Levine pointed to a media report he’d read.)
“It can be an advantage not to be an actual scientist,” he said in an interview. “I can be more of a bridge.”
Throughout the crisis, Levine has become a fixture in the local, national and international media, including several Spanish-language programs. There’s a natural reason people are paying attention: He oversees the city’s $1.6 billion health department. But his credentials are more extensive, giving him broad, poignant insight into flash points surrounding the pandemic.
He knows schooling from his days as a bilingual math and science teacher in the South Bronx and his time as Teach For America’s New York City director. He knows financial insecurity and behavioral economics from his founding of Harlem’s Neighborhood Trust Federal Credit Union. He knows mass transit from serving as transportation chair of his Manhattan community board.
Levine is fluent in Hebrew and Spanish and small-talk smatterings of Arabic, Bengali, French, Greek and Gujarati — “enough to shock store owners,” he said. He has a bachelor’s degree in physics from Haverford College in Pennsylvania, a master’s in public policy from Harvard and now, suddenly, a spotlight.
His learning curve hasn’t flattened, he said, acknowledging having addressed plenty of questions about the crisis with “fairly mushy answers.” Call it an occupational hazard.
“Public health is where hardcore science meets public opinion,” Levine said. “The best science in the world isn’t worth anything if you can’t make it compelling.”
That has meant, for example, throwing cold water on what he called “irrational exuberance” around antibody tests, dubbing the science — which has so far shown both “false negative” and “false positive results” — a “dose of reality.” He has said, too, that New York City cannot get ahead of the virus until daily new infections drop below 500. They’re now at least 1,300, conservatively.
He laid out public health benchmarks that need to be met for 10 to 14 days before there’s further consideration of restarting key sectors of the economy and then noted on Twitter that “so far we haven’t hit any of these marks for even 1 day.” And he has rallied behind the city health commissioner, Oxiris Barbot — who is a pediatrician, not an epidemiologist, pathologist or virologist — calling her a “sober, science-based” leader managing “one of the toughest jobs on Earth” despite calls from some council colleagues that her initial misreading of the crisis merits resignation.
Without many analogues nationally — although he closely monitors developments in Chicago and Los Angeles — Levine stays informed on a steady diet of BBC podcasts, TVE1 Spanish news, and Kan Hadashot Israeli television. He has scrutinized missteps in Japan and Singapore. And citing models that suggest a substantial undercount of the loss of life after Hurricane Maria brutalized Puerto Rico in 2017, he said New York’s citywide death toll is likely far larger when accounting for a surge in the number of people who’ve died at home during the crisis.
Now, the city needs a temporary 15,000-person Public Health Corps, Levine said, calling such an undertaking “almost unprecedented” in the nation’s history. “We essentially have to do the equivalent of building FDNY in 30 days, an agency of that scale and complexity,” including “a new transportation system, new telemedicine system, and hoteling for thousands,” he said. Targeted inclusion of homeless and undocumented New Yorkers is a must, he added.
Levine’s approach throughout the crisis has not won universal praise here. De Blasio declined to be interviewed for this report, as did Corey Johnson (D), the city council’s speaker, and Demetre Daskalakis, the city’s deputy commissioner for the health department’s division of disease control. In a statement, Johnson said Levine “has worked tirelessly to help us navigate this crisis” and that he intends to “work together to help our city weather this storm and come out stronger someday in the future.”
Front-line essential workers were more forthcoming. “The answers to the scientific questions are unsatisfying. We can’t guarantee safety. It’s unsatisfying to hear that,” said David Reich, the president and chief operating officer of Mount Sinai Hospital. “To Mark’s credit, he’s able to hear that without losing it. He’s a cut above some of the other [politicians] who don’t want to hear about uncertainty because they want answers.”
Craig Spencer, the epidemiologist who is director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, which is in Levine’s district, concurred. “Sometimes he’s had a different take than other people in the city,” said Spencer, who survived an Ebola infection in New York in 2014, “but that’s because he’s done a really good job of reaching out and understanding what’s happening in emergency departments.” He also hailed the council member’s commitment to bilingual messaging.
But being all science-based in this pandemic is not exactly terra firma. Studies about this novel virus are largely being shared before the peer review process. The general social distancing rule of six feet can become much greater in some studies. What was thought of as an infection of the lungs turns out to affect heart and kidney function, too. What was once discussed almost exclusively as an infection afflicting the elderly also causes sudden strokes in the young. Medicine is as shifting as the nation’s new normals.
Levine’s tweets have shifted, too. He has deleted at least five during the crisis. His explanation was terse: “Too despondent.”
As debates roil and actions drag, Levine keeps another tweet front of mind, one written by Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and onetime New York City health commissioner. On April 6, Frieden tweeted a timeline of stay-at-home orders for 41 states and D.C. New York was fourth, three days after California. “2 days later & NYC deaths would have doubled. Days earlier & so many deaths could have been prevented,” Frieden wrote.
“We should take that to heart and use extreme caution before every step we take to slowly reopen our economy,” Levine said. Or else what? “Our ERs will start filling up again.”"
"April 30, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/trump-poised-to-announce-bridge-loans-for-ailing-oil-companies/2020/04/29/0a61453c-8a60-11ea-80df-d24b35a568ae_story.html,The Washington Post,Trump Poised to Unveil Bridge Loans for Ailing Oil Companies,"The Trump administration may announce as soon as Thursday a plan to offer loans to the ailing oil industry possibly in exchange for a financial stake, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette have already briefed President Donald Trump on a plan to provide financial aid to oil drillers beset by a historic crash in prices, the people said.
Brouillette, during a conference call Tuesday with an industry group, said Mnuchin was leaning toward aid that includes two separate programs -- bridge loans and emergency lending authority through the U.S. Federal Reserve -- designed to help smaller and medium sized companies.
“This is not going to be a bailout,” Mnuchin told reporters in the White House Wednesday. He said a team at both the Treasury and the Energy department are talking with people around the world and are considering “a lot of different strategies.”
Trump said an announcement would come “shortly.”
The move comes as companies coping with a devastating plunge in prices have been laying off tens of thousands of workers and idling drilling rigs while asking for government assistance as they seek to stave off bankruptcies. Trump last week vowed to make funds available to oil and gas companies, saying he would “never let the great U.S. Oil & Gas Industry down.”
More Storage
Mnuchin said the administration was also exploring the opportunity to store another several hundred million barrels of oil, which would exceed the current physical capacity of the government’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The administration has been considering a way around that physical barrier, by buying undeveloped oil reserves and making them part of the U.S. emergency stockpile. Under the approach, the government would effectively pay some domestic drillers to halt production indefinitely -- or at least until prices rebound.
Trump earlier helped broker a deal by top international oil producers to pull nearly 10 million barrels of crude from the market. Yet demand has collapsed by at least twice that amount and storage tanks will keep filling with crude as long as coronavirus restrictions keep planes grounded and drivers off the roads.
If the federal government steps in, some forms of lending would involve it taking a stake in the companies -- a condition oil companies are likely loathe to accept, according to the two people familiar with the discussions.
“There are some in the industry who are more in need of these types of resources then others,” Brouillette said in a phone call Tuesday, a recording of which was posted on North Dakota Petroleum Council’s website.
The White House referred queries to the National Security Council which declined to comment. The Energy and Treasury Departments declined to comment.
Eligible Companies
The Trump administration has been working to identify oil companies that would be eligible for loans under the existing Main Street program without being forced to establish a new industry-focused initiative that could be unpopular with the public, said a person familiar with the matter who, like the other people, asked not to be named detailing private deliberations.
The administration intends to focus the efforts on small to medium oil companies that had strong or fair credit ratings before the pandemic.
Mnuchin earlier this month authorized the Fed to establish a so-called Main Street lending program, aimed at supporting mid-sized businesses with as many as 10,000 employees and less than $2.5 billion in revenues.
The Fed has not yet launched the program. It will purchase as much as $600 billion in loans from banks, and could buy even more if Mnuchin commits more Treasury funds to backstop the program, which he said he is willing to do.
The Fed will expand the Main Street program, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday at a press conference, adding that it would add sectors and lending products to address credit needs across the broader economy.
Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, and the Independent Petroleum Association of America have stressed that oil companies need flexibility to use Main Street loans to repay existing debt.
The program bars recipients from using loan proceeds to finance pre-existing debt and places restrictions on the size of loans for businesses with large amounts of debt. Those limitations are enough to prevent small- and medium-sized oil companies from taking advantage of the program to gain “the short-term liquidity they need to avoid bankruptcy,” Cruz said in a letter to Mnuchin and Powell last week."

But challenges remain. One big one is to get its Main Street Lending Program up and working well. As the Fed describes it, this program “is intended to facilitate lending to small and medium sized businesses” by banks and savings and loans. The program envisions as much as $600 billion of borrowing from a special Fed facility backstopped by $75 billion of Treasury funding. 
The program consists of two parts: the Main Street New Loan Facility and the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility. The former would provide new loans to eligible borrowers and the latter would provide funds to increase the size of loans made before April 8. 
Businesses with as many as 10,000 employees or up to $2.5 billion in annual revenue who didn’t participate in the Fed’s Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility would be eligible. 
Loans would be divided, with 95% held by the Fed’s lending facility and 5% retained by the lender. The 5% share is designed to ensure that the lender has “skin in the game” and therefore does a prudent job in underwriting the loan. The Fed is essentially outsourcing most of the underwriting decisions to lenders.   
The loans would mature in four years and range from $1 million to $25 million. No repayment of principal or interest would be due in the first year and there would be no prepayment penalty.
If the Fed gets the balance right, the program will support the extension of credit to viable smaller and medium-sized enterprises. By taking the bulk of the loans on its own balance sheet, the Fed will expand the capacity of the banking system to lend. However, if the Fed gets the balance wrong, it may find the facility either neglected or, at the other extreme, flooded with bad loans.  
The design of the lending facilities faces two hurdles. The first is to ensure prudent loan underwriting. Keeping bad businesses afloat just makes it more difficult for more viable companies to survive and prosper. The second is terms that ensure banks will lend and viable businesses will borrow. 
It will be hard for the Fed to thread this needle. Consider what it will take for lenders to extend credit that’s consistent with the Fed’s and the Treasury’s risk tolerance. If the loan is truly an attractive credit, there’s little reason to farm it out to the Fed. Why not just keep the loan on its own books or syndicate the credit with other lenders?  
In contrast, if the loan is less attractive, why would a lender want to take the risk? Here the answers may be less than reassuring. One reason is that new funding will keep the business going for a while, letting it meet  its other obligations -- including, perhaps, to the lender originating the loan. Throwing good money after bad may be more attractive when most of the good money belongs to someone else. In the same vein, the loan may be unattractive on its own, but as part of a broader banking relationship it might make sense. Finally, the restraints on the use of the loan proceeds may be difficult to enforce. What is to prevent the borrower from using a loan from Bank A to repay obligations to Bank B, and a loan from Bank B to repay obligations to Bank A?
Another problem is the “one size fits all” approach to the limits on leverage. How much leverage is too much depends on the type of business and how that business has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The debt-to-ebitda limit of four times for the Main Street New Loan Facility may be too low for some types of borrowers (they may have already been above that limit in 2019) and too high for others. Consider, for example, the difference between a supermarket chain, an essential service that’s open, versus a restaurant company, that’s closed. Adverse selection might result: Highly leveraged borrowers with stable cash flows may be ineligible to participate while borrowers that were less leveraged in 2019 but in much greater trouble today can get funding.  
Also, it is not clear that the program ensures a level playing field for prospective borrowers. If a smaller business has borrowed mainly outside the banking system in the past, how amenable will banks be to lend to such a company compared with a business with an established lending relationship?  
Finally, the Main Street Lending program imposes a number of constraints on borrowers. In addition to restricting how the loan proceeds can be used, the eligible borrower must try to keep its payroll intact during the term of the loan and follow the compensation, stock-repurchase and capital-distribution restrictions that apply to direct loan programs under the $2 trillion CARES Act. Borrowers that are in relatively good shape will want to avoid these types of constraints, meaning the potential pool of borrowers might be made up of riskier businesses.   
The Fed’s goals for the Main Street Lending program are admirable: It’s meant to fill a gap between the Small Business Administration loans available to small businesses and the support the Fed is providing for the corporate bond market, which benefits large corporations.

U.S. airlines reached deals to access a share of $50 billion in federal payroll assistance to bridge funding gaps as the industry waits for customers to start flying again. Companies accepting the aid can’t furlough or reduce wages for workers until Sept. 30.
“At the moment there are no thoughts for changing those restrictions or additional money,” Mnuchin told reporters Wednesday during a video conference. “This money was critical to keep the airlines together, which was important for national security.”
Many airlines announced the possibility of thousands of job cuts after September, including United Airlines Holdings Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., and Southwest Airlines Co.
Airline analyst Helane Becker of Cowen & Co. said as many as 105,000 jobs could be lost in the industry unless there’s a quick improvement in demand.
Half of the money Mnuchin is disbursing is in payroll grants, while the rest are loans. He has so far doled out more than $12 billion to 93 companies, and more is expected to be sent out on a “rolling basis,” the department has said.
“We’ve struck the right balance of both payroll support and offering them lending facilities which will also create additional liquidity,” Mnuchin said. Airlines can also turn to the Federal Reserve for support, he said.
Among the Fed’s coronavirus-related programs is the Main Street lending facility for mid-size businesses. Mnuchin has so far committed $75 billion from Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund to backstop that program, which can create as much as $600 billion in liquidity."

The agency took the measure following outrage over larger firms, including high-profile restaurant chains, getting loans under the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, that is designed to shore up small businesses during the shutdowns because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The SBA is accepting only applications from lenders with assets of less than $1 billion between 4 p.m. New York time until 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday. The agency said in an email that it and U.S. Treasury Department “will evaluate whether to create a similar reserved time again in the future.”
The agency is seeking to improve access to its overwhelmed loan-processing system amid a flood of applications as the program relaunched Monday with an additional $320 billion after the initial round of $349 billion ran out on April 16. While trying to process an unprecedented amount of money in just days, the SBA has been facing complaints from all sides -- from business owners to bankers and lawmakers.
“We’ve pivoted, and we’ve made it very, very reasonable for all banks to participate in this program,” SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza said on the “The DeMaio Report with Carl DeMaio and Lou Penrose” radio program Wednesday.
The move was criticized by groups representing large financial institutions, but welcomed by community lenders.
After lenders of all sizes complained that the SBA system was inaccessible or kicked them out when the program restarted on Monday, the agency told lenders on Tuesday they could not use robotic systems to help submit applications so the platform “will be more reliable, accessible, and equitable for all small businesses.” The SBA is also limiting the number of applications any one lender can submit each hour.
A coalition of trade groups representing the interests of thousands of U.S. banks and credit unions urged the SBA on Tuesday to fix its application system or to explain the problems directly to entrepreneurs.
The data SBA has reported so far suggest small lenders are getting through. Of the almost $90 billion in loans from more than 960,000 applications processed as of Wednesday evening, more than $43 billion came from the smallest financial institutions -- including $30 billion that Congress had carved out for them to disburse -- and more than $20 billion from mid-size lenders, SBA said. Lenders with more than $50 billion in assets had about 167,000 applications processed worth more than $25 billion, according to the agency.
Kevin Fromer, chief executive officer of the Financial Services Forum, said the SBA blocking almost 800 banks from submitting applications during that eight-hour period will delay relief to thousands of small business owners who use large banks.
“A better solution would be a fully operational system that allows banks of all sizes to provide support to Main Street,” Fromer said in a statement.
The Consumer Bankers Association also criticized the decision.
“This I don’t agree -- many small businesses went to banks over $1 billion to help provide for their family,” Consumer Bankers Association Chief Executive Officer Richard Hunt said in a tweet. “There was already a carve out for small banks and now this. Don’t play favorites with small businesses. All need a lifeline right now.”
It’s a welcome attempt to get loans to the self-employed, independent contractors and smallest firms, according to Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America.
“It’s a smart move, particularly after the backlash of large businesses getting these loans,” Merski said.
Meanwhile, lawmakers are complaining that big banks and large companies are getting help at the expense of small firms and are calling for investigations. Democratic Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio sent a letter to SBA and Treasury on Tuesday saying applications for loans of less than $1 million should be processed first."

Despite much hype around several existing drugs, we still haven’t found a proven, evidence-based treatment for Covid-19. The stakes are clearly high, with a vaccine at least a year away, if at all, and countries around the world facing a potential second wave of infections as they start to lift draconian lockdown measures. A conclusive finding that one of the already-available medicines can reduce the viral load or severity of symptoms in infected patients would be a “game changer,” as French state medical adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy said on local radio on Monday.For now, we’re still waiting for convincing evidence of whether potentially promising drugs actually work. A European trial of four treatments, dubbed “Discovery,” began in March; it was due to give early results in the first week of April. That date was pushed back to this week after a slow start getting off the ground. In that time, tens of thousands of people have died.It’s tempting to imagine the blame for lost time lies with bureaucratic red tape and squabbling scientists who prefer idle box-ticking to daring experiments with drugs on the pandemic’s front lines. That’s the narrative favored by supporters of Didier Raoult, the flamboyant French doctor who first flagged anti-malaria drug chloroquine as a promising treatment in February. While the scientific establishment waits for conclusive trial results, self-declared “maverick” Raoult has been using hydroxychloroquine (a less toxic derivative of chloroquine) on patients. U.S. President Donald Trump’s endorsement of the drug, and his pressure on regulators to fast track it, have made it a household name.
But, if anything, it’s the mavericks not the bureaucrats who have slowed things down.
Recent trials of hydroxychloroquine, for example, have been criticized for cutting a lot of corners without showing clinically significant effects. Raoult’s test in Marseilles used a small sample size of 42 patients, their enrollment wasn’t randomized and one patient who died was excluded from the results. Subsequent trials elsewhere were also found to be of limited quality. A review by Birmingham University’s Robin Ferner and Oxford University’s Jeffrey Aronson found that most hadn’t been blinded, meaning those involved knew which treatment was being administered to whom. Other drawbacks included inconsistent treatment procedures, such as the addition of the antibiotic azithromycin, which when combined with hydroxychloroquine can cause dangerous heart problems. Of the 142 hydroxychloroquine trials registered as of April 14, only about 35% were designed to be blinded, the review found.Sacrificing standards for speed hasn’t just resulted in a lack of evidence; it has hampered and delayed follow-up studies. When the “Discovery” mega-study began enrolling patients in March, it immediately hit a big hurdle — patients swayed by headlines only wanted to be treated with hydroxychloroquine. In the U.S., one patient who was offered the chance to trial Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir asked for “Trump’s drug” instead. The hype around potential treatments has also spurred countries to hoard drugs, hurting their availability.Doctors are understandably in an ethical bind in this pandemic. The urge to “try everything” is strong when patients and their families are visibly suffering. Yet speed has to be balanced against other trade-offs like patient safety, too. And the grim truth is that a double-blind, randomized trial of several drugs could have been conducted by now.This week has brought glimmers of optimism from other trials, though it’s still early days. The Paris region’s hospital association announced that a randomized 129-patient trial of tocilizumab (marketed by Roche Holding AG as Actemra) launched just a month ago has already shown “significant” improvement for Covid-19 sufferers — though the results aren’t yet peer reviewed. On Wednesday, Gilead said positive findings were emerging from a study of remdesivir by the U.S.’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.There are other ways to accelerate research in a pandemic. One option is the use of adaptive platform trials, in which several treatments are monitored at the same time so that resources can be shifted toward those that are the most effective, as my colleague Max Nisen has written. Artificial intelligence can also help. The University of Pittsburgh is using machine learning to power its own adaptive trial of potential Covid-19 treatments across 40 hospitals. Even before testing, researchers are being called upon to use computational methods to screen existing treatments quickly, as in one initiative by a European moon-shot foundation called JEDI.And if there is conclusive evidence that a cheap generic drug like hydroxychloroquine works, then the pharmaceutical supply chain may find new ways to meet a rise in demand. French firm Rondol Industrie is testing the ability of drug-blending machines to make more efficient doses of hydroxychloroquine that would improve absorption into the human body. The benefits of a lower dose for the same treatment result could include fewer side effects and lower production costs. It would also make it possible to treat more patients with the same quantity of active pharmaceutical ingredient.Without that evidence, though, we will only be wasting time. Clinical trials are logistically and financially costly, but they’re invaluable. A new pledge by world leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel to raise $8 billion for the development and accessibility of possible treatments for Covid-19 will help. This is a race without an obvious shortcut."

A boat carrying silks from the Ottoman Empire was allowed to skip the usual 40 days’ quarantine to unload its cargo, unleashing an epidemic that wiped out almost half the city’s population and which didn’t fully subside until two years later.
It’s this kind of fear that haunts France’s central planners today as they prepare to lift draconian stay-at-home measures designed to halt the (far less deadly) coronavirus. The lockdown has reached its limit: Public opinion is now against it. Isolation at home has saved more than 60,000 lives, but it has also cratered the economy and infantilized citizens by policing their movement, restricting the purchase of masks and nicotine patches, and banning daytime jogging in the city of Paris. The worry for the state is how to ease measures without triggering a second wave of infections.
Judging by the lockdown exit strategy unveiled this week, President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, both graduates of France’s elite school for civil servants, are opting for meticulous caution. Starting May 11, and over several months, businesses, schools and entertainment venues will gradually reopen, with bars and restaurants shut until at least June and sporting events forbidden until September. Masks will have to be worn on public transport. Yet the real technocratic twist is that there will be not one plan but 101, one for each of the country’s administrative departments. Like a weather report, and based on criteria including the rate of infection and testing resources, each area will get a daily rating — green or red — that dictates its ability to lift restrictions.
The French seem to be going from one extraordinary human experiment to another. Ending Europe’s visa-free travel area between countries was one thing, but now the nation state is being carved up; Spain is also lifting lockdowns by region, while Italy’s restrictions were initially a local affair. Parisians, who’ve suffered a 74% rise in deaths year-on-year since the start of the crisis, will wonder if they’re even in the same country as Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast, whose department has actually seen the number of deaths dip. A red rating for a hard-hit area might mean shops or public spaces stay shut; being deemed green would allow parks and some schools to reopen. And the hardest part to stomach: Citizens living in red areas will be told not to travel to green ones. Americans and Germans may be used to divides in their federal system, but for the French it’s a total revolution.
Obviously there’s no telling how a fragmented, petri-dish society created by central planning will actually behave. When the lockdown was first introduced, more than 1 million people fled the Paris region for more pleasant pastures. Will “red” residents now make an irresponsible break for a “green” zone? It’s possible, just as hopes for a jump in economic activity in “green” areas and responsible following of rules in “red” ones may prove optimistic. Fear of the virus may keep people home even in newly reopened areas, while frustration at longer lockdowns elsewhere may incite rule dodging.
What’s encouraging is that, unlike the current lockdown, more responsibility is being placed in the hands of people and their local elected representatives. The omnipresent state has been both a curse and a blessing in this crisis, proving very adept at protecting jobs and companies but not so good at managing hospital resources, mask stockpiles or laboratory tests. Now the government is promising to ramp up the availability of masks, tests and contact tracing — the motto is now “protect, test, isolate” — while letting local mayors have more of a say in how to manage post-lockdown society. The French are being offered behavioral choices — such as whether to let their children attend school or whether to wear a mask outdoors — and not just the threat of a fine. (Though that’s still there for long trips of over 100 kilometers (62 miles).)
And as infantilizing as a color-coded France may be for those living in it, it also gives society a common goal to work toward — namely making the entire map green. Trying to keep people’s minds on responsible social distancing when the infection curve is ebbing isn’t easy. The virus’s urgency is fading, and health concerns are clearly no longer the sole be-all-and-end-all of policy (the French government is reopening schools against the advice of its medical team). What’s left is the carrot-and-stick approach: The more green on the map, the more freedoms are won back, and the less likely a second lockdown becomes. And if infections do flare again somewhere, there’s now a system in place to ratchet restrictions up locally first.
France knows it can’t afford another national lockdown — the social and economic costs would be unbearable. So it has effectively found 101 ways to extend the original one as far as it can go. Now the test is whether human behavior can dash the best-laid plans of technocrats."
"April 30, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/04/29/protesters-paint-mural-jeff-bezoss-doorstep-demanding-health-protections-essential-workers/,The Washington Post,"Protesters paint mural on Jeff Bezos’s doorstep, demanding health protections for essential workers","It took about an hour for activists to get their message across: the words “protect Amazon workers” painted in bright red and yellow on the black asphalt outside the vast D.C. property owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
Neighbors paused to take pictures of the message or marvel at the red silhouettes of masked workers drawn on the ground.
“Thanks for making my neighborhood so beautiful,” shouted Jim Eagleson, 69, as he walked by wearing a homemade mask.
“I don’t know what good it’s going to do,” he told his companion later. “Who knows if [Bezos] is even here.”
Activists from the Shutdown DC climate movement and Virginia immigrant rights group La ColectiVA said that they want Bezos to do more to protect workers who continue to report to warehouses and deliver goods during the novel coronavirus pandemic and that their protest seeks to amplify calls for help from Amazon workers who have staged protests nationwide. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
Amazon has responded by handing out masks to warehouse workers and checking the temperatures of employees as they begin shifts. The company also increased pay for hourly workers in the country by $2 through the end of this month. But activists said independent contractors and other workers on whom the company relies are not being adequately protected.
“We urge others to compare the safety, pay and benefits measures we have taken for employees against other [companies],” said Amazon spokeswoman Lisa Levandowski. “Whether it’s temperature checks, getting masks to all employees and partners, to gloves, procuring necessary cleaning supplies, to moving fast to shift social distancing in our sites, we have aggressively worked to ensure the safety of our teams.”
Amazon projections estimate the company will spend more than $800 million in the first half of this year on safety measures meant to protect employees from the spread of covid-19 through the purchase of protective equipment, including masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, thermometers, disinfectant and more.
There was no activity Wednesday at the D.C. mansion — a sprawling property in the upscale Kalorama neighborhood that formerly housed a textile museum — as the protesters worked, its many windows drawn shut.
D.C. police cruisers blocked off S Street NW to allow the painting to continue. Officers standing watch said they were there to ensure the group was adhering to social distancing guidelines that outlaw gatherings of more than 10 people.
“We’re calling him and Amazon out for leaving their workers out here without the proper” personal protective equipment, said Laura Beth Pelner, 35, who designed the mural. “We’re calling all these essential workers heroes — grocery store workers and delivery drivers and everyone working at these Amazon warehouses filling people’s orders — but corporations aren’t doing enough to protect them. Essential workers are not expendable.”
As the paint dried on the street, protesters in masks and bandannas gathered for a photo, paintbrushes raised high in the air.
“Protect Amazon workers!” the group chanted.
Pelner said the paint should last until the next rainstorm, at which point she expected it would be washed away. But the end came sooner than that.
Less than two hours after the demonstrators cleared out, a masked worker arrived with a hose."
"April 30, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/elon-musk-and-tesla-bulls-are-so-over-this-covid-19-panic/2020/04/29/52c6d7e8-8a7d-11ea-80df-d24b35a568ae_story.html,The Washington Post,Elon Musk and Tesla Bulls Are So Over This Covid-19 Panic,"Tesla’s earnings — as in the numbers, rather than the show — are essentially meaningless.
Case in point: $16 million. That’s Tesla Inc.’s GAAP net income for the first quarter. It was a surprise relative to the consensus estimate. Two things, though: First, that consensus has been dropping like a stone. Second, the earnings are vastly more than explained by a surge in Tesla’s sales of greenhouse-gas emission credits to $354 million, more than double the average for last year(1). Those credits also boosted Tesla’s reported gross margin on automotive sales to 25.5% from an underlying 20%, a number that itself lacks details until we get the 10Q filing.
Yet, on the back of this, Tesla’s market cap rose by another $21 billion in aftermarket trading. Indeed, since another surprise profit in October kicked off a surge in Tesla’s market cap, it has risen by more than $115 billion. Sum total of earnings reported in that time: $264 million. Credits sold: $621 million. I would say “you do the math,” but let’s face it, who does?
For many companies, this earnings season is simultaneously dreadful and, because of Covid-19, excusable. Yet it’s worth remembering the worst of it hit the U.S. in April. Tesla didn’t even suspend operations at its main plant in Fremont, California, until the last week of the month (and even then, only after some back-and-forth with local officials). Tesla’s announcement Wednesday evening should be read in this context.
Liquidity is all in the middle of this pandemic, and Tesla noted up top its cash balance increased by $1.8 billion to more than $8 billion. Recall, however, Tesla raised $2.3 billion by selling new shares in February. Actual free cash flow for the quarter, as in cash from operations less capital expenditure, was negative $895 million. In other words, Tesla burned through almost 40% of the cash it raised.
Similar to last year, Tesla also kicked off 2020 by under-spending relative to capex guidance provided two months ago. Had it met even the low end of that range, then cash burn would have been closer to $1.1 billion. A counter-argument might be Covid-19 had already begun to affect spending decisions last quarter. But Tesla noted Wednesday it continues to invest “significantly” in its products and aims to grow capacity quickly.
Another counter-argument is that Tesla suffered a build-up in inventory of almost $1 billion. This makes more sense given disruption was spreading across the world in March. However, it also points to the pressures building this quarter.
If Covid-19 suddenly went away and activity returned to normal, then that inventory pile-up would unwind quickly. But that is unlikely to happen. While Tesla’s new factory in Shanghai is getting up to speed, lock-downs mean it will likely be several more weeks at least before the more important U.S. plants are back up and running.
I don’t think it’s an accident that CEO Elon Musk, who in early March dismissed the coronavirus panic as “dumb,” took to Twitter again on Tuesday evening to demand that (Someone? The cosmos? Bots?) “FREE AMERICA NOW.” On Wednesday’s call, he characterized the lock-downs as — limber up your eyeballs for a good old roll now — “fascist.” 
Meanwhile, the backdrop remains a deep recession hitting vehicle sales worldwide. Tesla held off revising full-year vehicle sales guidance. But since it implies a jump of more than one-third, year over year, through the rest of 2020, it can safely be ignored. The company’s statement about managing costs and working capital carefully is more relevant.
The combination of the past quarter’s cash burn, this quarter’s likely worse cash burn, and the murky outlook means the odds we could see another equity raise this year are rising. All the familiar narrative elements — China, Model Y, new factories, self-driving and even the elusive Semi truck — were on display Wednesday.
And, given the stock price, investors appear ready for it. Dilution seems of no concern. Indeed, even if the stock stayed flat at Wednesday’s close, then Musk would be in line to get the first tranche, worth 1% of shares outstanding, of his gigantic stock-award program set up in 2018. This is dependent on Tesla hitting various metrics, including averaging at least $100 billion of market cap over 30 days and six months.
If someone was paying $900 for Tesla’s stock in February and, despite everything in between, almost $900 on Wednesday evening, then they aren’t just looking beyond Covid-19. Their time horizon may stretch beyond whenever the next pandemic turns up. Who needs earnings?"

It Needs a Roosevelt,"Small Indian companies getting decimated by the world’s harshest coronavirus lockdown finally see a ray of hope.
Details are still sketchy, but the Indian government plans to backstop banks if they increase overdraft limits by 20%, providing 3 trillion rupees ($39 billion) of new working capital to smaller enterprises, Bloomberg News has reported. A state-sponsored fund will absorb losses.
Seeing how the U.S. Small Business Administration’s paycheck protection program has been overwhelmed by demand, India needs to match urgency with careful design. My colleague Shuli Ren has noted how Chinese business owners have diverted anti-virus funding to property or wealth management products. This could happen in India, too. Yet it would be a bigger mistake to dither indefinitely because some fiscal assistance may be misused. 
Three out of four Indian employees work casually for others or at family firms and farms. It’s perfectly normal for even white-collar workers to get paid in cash with no social security. Migrant blue-collar workers are either walking hundreds of kilometers back to their villages or have already returned, scared and scarred, from the cities. If broad-based help isn’t offered to small businesses, the strides the country has taken in lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty over the last 30 years might be at risk.
Since the goal is to protect workers by giving employers an incentive to pay them, hitting that objective in a highly informal economy is the first challenge. The second is channeling credit when banks, nonbank financiers and debt mutual funds — like the six local Franklin Templeton entities put into suspended animation last week — are gripped by a mistrust of borrowers that predates the pandemic. Fiscal fear-mongering is the third obstacle.
I’m assuming the state-backed advances would be offered at a concessional rate, with the interest subsidy borne in the federal budget. Banks would make loans for a fee, and turn them over to the guarantee fund, which would issue bonds to fund the purchase. Since non-payments will be made good by New Delhi, the bonds can be sovereign-backed. Who will buy them? Even if foreign investors don’t bite because of nervousness about the rupee, local banks are flush with liquidity. State Bank of India will still make money even if a customer defaults, if it sells its exposure to the fund in exchange for special sovereign bonds.
Every nudge by the Reserve Bank of India to make lenders take credit risk has fallen flat because they want the sovereign to lead. That’s where the guarantee comes in. At 1.4% of GDP, taxpayers’ exposure isn’t minor. Yet the backstop won’t meet pent-up demand. Amplifying its effect, and ensuring that banks don’t just throw money at politically connected borrowers, will require lenders to keep some skin in the game. Say the fund buys $80 of every $100 of risk, leaving $20 with banks. Just as with the U.S. protection program, lenders ought to be able to get cheap term loans from the RBI to finance their portion.
Small firms’ working capital needs swell because large customers, including the government, take too long to pay. A parallel push to get all vendor bills on a discounting platform will improve cash flows. To ensure that the extra credit actually reaches workers, New Delhi may have to defray a part of the wage bill for some time. Businesses taking the help would demonstrate regular payments into social security accounts, topped up by the government. This expensive separate arrangement might require the central bank to fund it by printing new money. With the jobless rate in excess of 23%, this isn’t a time to worry about losing India’s investment-grade sovereign rating. The country’s chances of slipping into junk-bond status are low this year anyway.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given little indication that he wants to be India’s version of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. But migrant workers tossed out of cities with no food, shelter or transport won’t return without a New Deal: nest eggs for old age and healthcare. China’s hukou — or city permits — discriminate against rural workers. In India, where urbanization and labor mobility are weapons against built-in caste prejudice, a lifeline to small businesses is an economic and a moral imperative. As long as the recipients become the building blocks of universal social security, it will be $39 billion well spent."

(Though that’s still there for long trips of over 100 kilometers (62 miles).)
And as infantilizing as a color-coded France may be for those living in it, it also gives society a common goal to work toward — namely making the entire map green. Trying to keep people’s minds on responsible social distancing when the infection curve is ebbing isn’t easy. The virus’s urgency is fading, and health concerns are clearly no longer the sole be-all-and-end-all of policy (the French government is reopening schools against the advice of its medical team). What’s left is the carrot-and-stick approach: The more green on the map, the more freedoms are won back, and the less likely a second lockdown becomes. And if infections do flare again somewhere, there’s now a system in place to ratchet restrictions up locally first.
France knows it can’t afford another national lockdown — the social and economic costs would be unbearable. So it has effectively found 101 ways to extend the original one as far as it can go. Now the test is whether human behavior can dash the best-laid plans of technocrats."
"May 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/30/lebanons-riots-come-no-surprise-even-during-pandemic/,The Washington Post,Lebanon’s riots come as no surprise — even during a pandemic,"As in any other country now under lockdown during the covid-19 outbreak, things were quiet in Lebanon.
For weeks, social media feeds were full of photos of clear Beirut skylines without the regular unpleasant smog and beautiful migratory birds on the country’s coast and valleys. It was so quiet, you wouldn’t think that the country had been rocked by months of protests and riots because of a damning economic crisis — or that these tensions were on the verge of erupting yet again.
Yet that is precisely what happened this week, as unrest began to erupt across the country. The novel coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout have only exacerbated the conditions that have driven Lebanese to the streets since last October, resulting in the resignation of then-Prime Minister Saad Hariri and the appointment of Hassan Diab as his successor.
Lebanon, among the most indebted countries in the world, defaulted on its extravagant foreign loans in March. In late February, the local currency, officially pegged at about 1,507 to the U.S. dollar, effectively devalued to 2,500. By the end of last week, that number was approaching 4,000. At the same time, the government continued to cut spending on its minimal social services, despite already having an economic system that blends laissez-faire capitalism and sectarian power-sharing to the benefit of the wealthy.
Coming on the heels of the ongoing economic crisis, the pandemic was simply a catalyst for its crash landing. With national poverty and unemployment rates approaching the 50 percent mark, lockdown measures that forced the closure of businesses meant that this already alarming statistic has become a conservative estimate.
Lebanon’s first reported covid-19 case came on Feb. 21, and the country went into lockdown by mid-March. In less than two months, Lebanon went from bad to worse: 75 percent of the country’s population is in need of aid, Social Affairs Minister Ramzi Musharrafieh told CNN on Wednesday.
Compensation from the government was nonexistent. It struggled to distribute a single payment of a meager $100 to 40,000 disadvantaged families — eventually postponing it indefinitely. And in an all too familiar scene, the political parties of the Lebanon’s ruling class used their vast resources and networks to distribute medical, food and financial aid in their constituencies. A resident in the mountainous town of Aytat told me they were sending disgruntled Lebanese a message: “You have no one but us.”
Unable to secure expenses for basic needs, including food, people began to protest across the country. Eyes were especially on the northern city of Tripoli, historically an economic stronghold but now a hub of the worst of the Lebanon’s horrifying economic inequality. A member of the municipal government there told me that authorities, along with the security forces and intelligence agencies, were unable to force people to stop working — though they tried — because of the dire economic situation.
The situation quickly spiraled out of control. Empty bank branches at night were sitting ducks as rioters lobbed molotov cocktails, while furious protesters set up roadblocks made up of burning tires and dumpsters. Unlike the images of Lebanon’s protests that international media fawned over late last year, there were no smiles, catchy songs or slogans. There was only rage.
And then it happened. While hundreds of protesters rioted on Tripoli’s Nour Square on Monday, the Lebanese army shot and killed 26 year-old Fawwaz al-Samman. After his funeral procession the following day at the location where he was killed, riots commenced all day and well into the night. The army put out a statement expressing regret and promising to investigate the incident. But tributes to al-Samman continued to take place in cities and towns across the country.
In a desperate attempt to quell the situation, the Internal Security Forces put out a statement Tuesday urging protesters to demonstrate like they did in late 2019, when they “won the attention and admiration” of so many people. But with all that’s happened, to sing and dance as they once did would be insanity.
When the demonstrations began, there was hope that, because the country was on the verge of economic collapse, the entrenched ruling class would finally realize their time is up. But it didn’t bite. Even a pandemic has not changed that.
After months of tense protests and unrest without a shift in the status quo, it would be dishonest or foolish to think that protesters in Nour Square in Tripoli or elsewhere in Lebanon would still be happy to dance in protest with a DJ, as was the case in October, while watching what’s left of their economy shatter into a million pieces. For anyone who has covered Lebanon’s social ills and witnessed the restraint of protesters for months as the country’s rulers looked the other way, these riots are no surprise at all.
What we are seeing today is a vivid portrayal of Lebanon’s political and socioeconomic realities. It might not be pretty, but reality bites."
"May 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-joe-biden-handles-the-tara-reade-allegations-is-a-crucial-test/2020/04/30/b1a37ffc-8afd-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html,The Washington Post,How Joe Biden can turn his biggest crisis into an opportunity,"It may happen sooner, or it may happen later. But make no mistake: It will happen. At some point, Joe Biden is going to have to personally address the allegations of former Senate staffer Tara Reade that he sexually assaulted her nearly 30 years ago.
Though it is doubtful there is anything he could say that would make the accusations disappear in this white-hot political season, the way he handles this will be a test of whether he is up to dealing with all the other things that will be thrown at him between now and November.
This is also an important opportunity for Biden to cut a path for others to follow in the #MeToo era. The former vice president has a chance to offer a model of how someone who is accused can responsibly defend himself against what he insists are false accusations while still honoring the principle that women who speak up should be treated with fairness and respect.
This is a conundrum that has always existed in cases of sexual abuse and harassment, where there are rarely eyewitnesses or airtight documentation.
In Biden’s case, there is also a unique opportunity to demonstrate good faith. He should open up the records of his 36-year Senate career that he donated to the University of Delaware in 2012 and that are under seal until two years after he leaves public life.
What might be in there? No one really knows until they look. The Senate does not operate under any equivalent of the 1978 Presidential Records Act, under which presidents and vice presidents are required to manage and preserve their records carefully. Then an archivist judges which should be made available to the public, which have information too sensitive to be disclosed and which are purely private.
Individual members of Congress, on the other hand, are left pretty much to their own discretion in deciding how to curate their records and what to do with them.
Biden’s might or might not include memos or other documents discussing Reade’s stint in his office as a staff assistant in 1993. The records might also show whether she ever lodged a complaint about his behavior — she says she did; Biden’s campaign says she didn’t — either to her superiors on the senator’s staff, or under procedures then available to take her grievances outside the office.
It would be challenging to submit his records to an examination. There are nearly 2,000 boxes of documents, presumably most of them still to be catalogued, so it would be infeasible to allow journalists unfettered access. Nor should his adversaries be offered the opportunity to embark on a fishing expedition for all sorts of potentially damaging information to use to their own advantage.
But finding another way to search would be worthwhile. Over the past three years, I have spent more hours than I can count doing research at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and other repositories of records for a biography I am writing on Nancy Reagan.
In the course of doing this, I have become a big believer in the precept espoused by Robert A. Caro, the legendary chronicler of the life of Lyndon B. Johnson: “Turn every page. Never assume anything.” Some of my most fascinating discoveries have been found in papers that have been misfiled or randomly grouped with things that seem unrelated.
What Biden should do is name a small group of well-respected, impartial researchers — historians, academics, archivists. Then, he should ask the University of Delaware to give them access to his papers as soon as the precautions put in place as a result of the novel coronavirus are loosened. My own experience with the solitary endeavor of digging through boxes of documents suggests it would not be all that hard to practice rudimentary social distancing.
A team of independent researchers could probably get through the material in a matter of weeks or a couple of months at the most. They could then issue a report on whether they found anything that was relevant to what Reade claimed happened to her. It would then be incumbent upon Biden to make those records public.
If Biden were to do something like this, it would be an extraordinary gesture of faith in his own innocence and the starkest contrast imaginable with how President Trump has handled the allegations of more than a dozen women who have accused him of sexual assault. Just as important, it would provide a badly needed example for others who find themselves in a situation like the one he is in."
"May 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-paid-trumps-dc-hotel-more-than-33000-for-lodging-to-guard-treasury-secretary/2020/04/30/cd38e864-8987-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html,The Washington Post,"Secret Service paid Trump’s D.C. hotel more than $33,000 for lodging to guard treasury secretary","The Secret Service rented a room at President Trump’s Washington hotel for 137 consecutive nights in 2017 — paying Trump’s company more than $33,000 — so it could guard Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin while he lived in one of the hotel’s luxury suites, according to federal documents and people familiar with the arrangement.
Mnuchin, a financier from New York, lived in the Trump International Hotel for several months before moving to a home in Washington. Mnuchin paid for his hotel suite himself, a Treasury Department spokesperson said.
But during his stay, the Secret Service also rented the room next door at taxpayer expense, to screen Mnuchin’s visitors and packages, according to three people familiar with that arrangement who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
For that room, the Trump hotel charged the maximum rate that federal agencies were generally allowed to pay in 2017: $242 per night, according to the billing records. The Secret Service checked in Jan. 25, according to billing records obtained by The Washington Post, and didn’t make its last payment until June 12.
The total bill was $33,154.
The Post has identified dozens of instances where the Secret Service paid money to Trump’s businesses — spending taxpayer dollars, often with little or no disclosure at the time. Often, these payments were triggered by Trump’s own travel to his properties.
This case is different, because it was set in motion by Mnuchin, one of Trump’s top appointees. In 2017, he chose a living arrangement that produced two revenue streams for Trump’s company. One came from Mnuchin. The other came from taxpayers.
In a written statement, a Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed that the Secret Service had rented the room next to Mnuchin’s. The Post asked if Mnuchin had considered that cost to taxpayers, in deciding how long he would stay.
“The Secretary was not aware of what the U.S. Secret Service paid for the adjoining room,” the spokesperson said.
Trump still owns his business but says he has given day-to-day control to his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. while he is in the White House. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment, and the White House declined to comment. The Secret Service also declined to comment, saying it would not discuss “the means and methods we utilize to carry out our protective responsibilities.”
The Constitution bars presidents from taking payments from the federal government, beyond their annual salary, now set at $400,000. But Trump — who says he donates his salary — has argued that this provision was not meant to prohibit business transactions such as a hotel-room rental.
Lawsuits challenging this practice have stalled in the federal courts.
Neither the Trump administration nor the Trump Organization has provided an accounting of how much federal agencies have paid to Trump’s company since Inauguration Day in 2017. The Post has sought to compile its own, using documents obtained via public records requests.
The Post has identified more than 170 payments from the Secret Service to Trump properties, totaling more than $620,000. In many cases, the Secret Service was paying to rent hotel rooms at Trump’s properties to accompany the president while he traveled. The actual total is likely to be higher, because the records released so far largely date from 2017 and 2018.
The $33,154 payment to Trump’s D.C. hotel was already known. The Secret Service had not explained why it had spent the money.
But recently, in response to a public records request from The Post, the Secret Service released hotel bills that show the answer: a single, very long stay.
“Arrival Date: 01/25/2017,” reads a five page-long bill from the Trump hotel to the Secret Service, released after a public-records request. “Room Number: 531.”
Room 531 itself is nothing unusual: a standard room with two queen beds, according to a former Trump hotel employee and internal Trump hotel documents obtained by The Post.
But it happens to adjoin one of the hotel’s jewels: the 2,000-square-foot Franklin Suite, with marble bathrooms, a dining table for six and views across to the Environmental Protection Agency building. In recent days, even with the hotel largely empty because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Franklin Suite was listed at $8,300 per night.
That was Mnuchin’s suite in 2017, according to one former Trump hotel staffer. The Treasury Department spokesperson said Mnuchin did stay in a suite at the hotel but could not recall the suite’s name. The spokesperson said Mnuchin negotiated a discounted rate with the hotel manager but declined to disclose it.
The Secret Service, which has protected treasury secretaries for decades, took Room 531 to screen packages, visitors and laundry, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of sensitivity about security protocols.
People familiar with Secret Service practices said that was standard procedure when an official stayed in any hotel. During the Clinton administration, for instance, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin lived in the Jefferson Hotel near the White House for years, and the Secret Service used the room next door, according to news reports.
The difference, in this case, is that Mnuchin and the Secret Service were paying for rooms in a hotel owned by the same president who had appointed Mnuchin.
“Normally, you would deliver any deliveries to the Secret Service and then they would give it to the person under protection,” the former Trump employee said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to stay on good terms with a former employer.
The rate, according to the newly released documents, was $242 per night for every night of the 137-night stay.
The Trump Organization did not respond to questions about how that rate was chosen. One possible reason: For much of 2017, $242 was the maximum amount that federal employees could spend on a hotel room in Washington, according to rules set by the General Services Administration.
That was less than the rates Trump’s company has charged the Secret Service for rooms at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, which have ranged from $396 to $650. That exceeded the maximum government rate, but the Secret Service is permitted to exceed those limits while on protective duty. And the $242 rate was probably less than what Trump’s D.C. hotel might have gotten from a nongovernment customer in Washington. In 2018, for instance, Room 531 rented for as much as $616 per night, according to Trump hotel records obtained by The Post.
But for the Trump hotel it was also a steady rental at a time when only about 42 percent of rooms were occupied, according to previously released data.
“We were not anywhere near full occupancy at the hotel,” the former hotel employee said.
Mnuchin bought a $12.6 million home in Washington in February 2017 and moved out of the Trump hotel sometime in “late spring,” the Treasury Department spokesperson said. The spokesperson did not give an exact date when Mnuchin left the hotel.
For the Secret Service, the last payment on Room 531 was made June 12.
But other payments to the Trump hotel continued: The Post has identified $126,000 in additional payments from the Secret Service to the hotel between January 2017 and February 2018.
The Secret Service has not explained any of the others. But some do seem to follow the pattern from this case, with dollar amounts in multiples of the $242 nightly room rate.
For instance: On June 28, 2017 — a night when Trump visited the hotel for a fundraiser dinner — the Secret Service paid the hotel $33,638.
That is an even bigger payment than the one for Room 531. It is exactly enough to rent 139 rooms at the $242 rate.
But the Secret Service has not said what it was paying for in that case."

The Small Business Administration and Treasury Department issued a new rule on Thursday for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was intended for small businesses to get loans of up to $10 million that convert to grants a company uses the proceeds to keep workers employed.
The new rule says that corporate groups shouldn’t get more than $20 million in total loans, which applies if businesses are “majority owned, directly or indirectly, by a common parent.” The limit is effective immediately for any loan not yet fully disbursed as of Thursday, the agencies said.
It’s the latest change to constantly shifting rules governing the PPP program, which have frustrated banks and business owners alike -- in particular after a loophole allowed big restaurant chains and hotel groups, among other large companies, to rake in millions in low-interest loans while mom and pop shops couldn’t access the program.
The new guidance also laid out criteria allowing non-bank lenders to handle loans “to ensure broad and diverse lender participation.”
Borrowers who have applied for or received more than $20 million in loans must withdraw or cancel any pending application or approved loan over the limit, according to the guidance. Failure to do so will be considered using funds for “unauthorized purposes, and the loan will not be eligible for forgiveness.”
At least 23 public companies have returned loans totaling $161 million so far, according to data compiled by FactSquared. Treasury and the SBA and have said the program wasn’t intended for large companies with access to other capital and urged firms that shouldn’t have applied to return the money by May 7 without penalty.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that loans above $2 million will be audited by SBA and warned that borrowers have criminal liability if they improperly certified that they needed the loans.
The program relaunched Monday with more than 5,000 lenders and an additional $320 billion approved by Congress, after an initial $349 billion was exhausted in just 13 days. As of Wednesday evening, the SBA had approved nearly $90 billion in loans from more than 960,000 applications in the second round."

Council,"D.C. COUNCIL members in recent years haven’t had to worry about finances. A booming local economy brought in lots of tax dollars. Indeed, it seemed that council members were competing to expand services and add programs — with little regard to expense.
Those days are gone. The council will have to face a world transformed by the novel coronavirus pandemic. On top of the health crisis, a massive budget shortfall is guaranteed.
The unprecedented challenges and uncertainties make all the more critical the choices voters will opt for this year in elections for the D.C. Council. On the ballot in the often decisive Democratic primary slated for June 2 are contests for seats in Wards 2, 4, 7 and 8. Two at-large seats will be filled in November’s general election.
The race in Ward 2 has attracted the most attention. Longtime representative Jack Evans, who resigned in January as the council was poised to expel him for ethical violations, is seeking to reclaim the seat. We supported expelling Mr. Evans if he refused to resign, and we cannot endorse his return. Fortunately, several other candidates are well qualified. Community leaders John Fanning and Patrick Kennedy have solid records and agendas, but the best choice is Brooke Pinto, a former assistant D.C. attorney general who would give Ward 2 a needed new start. She performed valuable work on tax matters and policy issues such as hate crimes and consumer fraud. Unlike some candidates promising the sky under the banner of progressive justice, she is steeped in reality and would hit the ground running with grit and smarts.
Brandon T. Todd has represented Ward 4 since 2015, when he won a special election after Muriel E. Bowser’s election as mayor, and voters should return him for another four-year term. He has had some stumbles, but despite critics’ biggest complaint — that he has been largely supportive of the mayor — he has been good for the city and for Ward 4. Instead of chasing headlines or pushing programs fashioned by advocates with a national agenda, Mr. Todd has focused on education reform and other issues of fundamental interest to Ward 4 residents.
In Ward 7, incumbent Vincent C. Gray faces a number of challengers, including an impressive attorney, Veda Rasheed, with a focus on combating violence. But Mr. Gray’s experience is too valuable to discard at this critical time. He forged a mastery of budget issues as council chair and mayor, and, as head of the council’s Health Committee, he is schooled in the city’s health needs. We were skeptical about Mr. Gray’s return to the council after he lost to Ms. Bowser in a bitter 2014 Democratic primary, but he has put aside political differences to address the needs of Ward 7.
Ward 8 Council member Trayon White Sr. has stepped up during the terrible weeks of the pandemic, bravely going out — gowned and masked — to deliver food and other goods to families in need. He also has helped focus attention on jail conditions. Those attributes, though, do not make up for his shortcomings in office. Mr. White has functioned more as a community activist than as a legislator, playing to his base of supporters rather than effectively addressing long-term needs of the entire community. A crowded field and Mr. White’s standout political skills make his reelection likely, but more effective representative is needed if Ward 8 is to get responsible development and improved education outcomes. A better choice is offered by Mike Austin, an attorney with deep ties to the community who was legislative director to former Ward 8 council member LaRuby May.
The social distancing and other safety measures that have been imposed to try to stop the spread of covid-19 could impact turnout. We urge voters to heed the advice of election officials in requesting an absentee ballot so they can vote by mail."
"May 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/with-census-field-operations-suspended-government-tries-to-stay-flexible/2020/04/30/067e3512-8a9f-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html,The Washington Post,"With census field operations suspended, government tries to stay flexible","Every ten years, the United States counts its residents in a multistage, meticulously planned operation that culminates in spring and summer, with hundreds of thousands of workers fanning out to public events and private homes to help complete the survey.
But this year, just as Census 2020 activities were set to roll out on a mass scale, covid-19 shut the country down. Now, instead of following the strict timeline developed and refined over years, the Census Bureau has been forced to embrace a flexibility in implementing the constitutionally mandated survey.
“The coronavirus is in the driver’s seat,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee. “The course of the epidemic will determine when and how the Census Bureau can carry out all of the major operations that have been disrupted in one way or another, which in turn will affect its ability to produce accurate results in the end. There are more uncertainties than not at this stage.”
Like many whose plans were interrupted by the pandemic, the bureau initially made minor adjustments, tweaking its schedule by a couple of weeks and redirecting advertising from public arenas to digital, radio and television — changes that still will allow it to deliver results to the president by the Dec. 31 due date.
But as it became clear the country could remain in some form of lockdown well into summer, the government shifted its approach. On April 13, the Trump administration told the House Oversight Committee it wanted more time to gather and deliver the data, which is used to determine a decade’s worth of congressional reapportionment and redistricting, as well as $1.5 trillion in federal funding annually.
Congress must approve any change in the deadline for delivering apportionment counts to the president; the Trump administration requested an additional four months, to April 30, 2021. The bureau also said it is planning a four-month extension of the deadline for delivering redistricting data to states, to July 31, 2021, and pushed the deadline for data collection from mid-August to Oct. 31 of this year.
The committee has yet to say whether it will approve the request to move the reporting deadline for apportionment. Its interactions with the administration over the census have been tense, with Democratic members accusing the government of withholding information related to its unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the survey.
Now, members say they need more information to consider the government’s request.
“They need, one, to actually start answering questions from our committee, and two, to have a detailed written plan that shows how they’re going to make sure it’s a complete and accurate count,” said a senior Democratic committee aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Census Bureau said Friday it is now planning a “phased” restart of its field operations, which had already been pushed back to June. Workers will go out at different times in different areas of the country based on “federal, state, and local public health guidance,” as well as the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE).
Bureau spokesman Michael Cook said the safety of census employees and the public will be paramount as the bureau assesses its ability to conduct the in-person part of the count. That includes bureau employees delivering the survey to populations that don’t have regular mailing addresses, such as some American Indian reservations, and knocking on the doors of households across the country that haven’t responded to mailed requests.
“We’ve already ordered PPEs … to equip our staff to be able to go out in public as soon as the local conditions are in line with us being able to resume operations,” Cook said.
But no plan can be airtight when it is unclear whether reopening parts of the country will result in a new rash of infections and lead to further shutdowns. Even if the bureau is able to stick to its current plan, a four-month delay in reporting census data could cause challenges for elections and redistricting next year.
Virginia and New Jersey hold off-year statewide elections in 2021, as do some local jurisdictions around the country. A delay of four months or longer would mean they would be unlikely to get information about districts and apportionment in time to hold primaries based on 2020 population data.
In cases where deadlines are set by the state constitution and timing is too tight, courts would likely need to decide whether to push back primaries, carry on with elections based on existing maps and wait to do redistricting, or seek other solutions.
“There might be a data set you could cobble together based on estimates,” said Justin Levitt, an election law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “I suspect that the courts would be more comfortable with elections based on maps based on old data rather than trying to work with new data.”
Litigation around redistricting, which is common after the census, will also be squeezed, he said, adding, “Unfortunately, incumbents could use it to their advantage.”
The delays could affect general elections as well, said Wendy Underhill, director of elections and redistricting for the National Conference of State Legislatures. States will have a much smaller window to determine which candidates can run in which district, to meet filing deadlines, and to create ballots for overseas voters.
“It’s really asking a lot to dump data on July 31 or even six weeks earlier and have them be prepared to run elections in the fall,” she said. “The states are going to need to be nimble.”
The bureau has a real-time online map that can tell, down to the census tract, what percentage of a city, county, state or the nation has responded. So far, over 54 percent of the nation has responded, which Cook said is ahead of where the bureau had estimated the country would be at this point
“At the rate at which we are going, we know that we will exceed our total projected response rate of 60.5 by the end of May,” he said.
That will allow five months for the bureau to collect the remaining 39.5 percent of responses. But collecting data over such a long period, and at different times based on location, creates its own set of concerns. The count is based on the number of people living in a household as of April 1; the more time that passes between that date and when households are counted, the more possibility there is for error, especially among traditionally undercounted populations that may be more transient.
“Conducting operations at different times in different geographic areas could skew the count,” the Oversight Committee aide said. “Those differences create room for error and they also create potential for inequities. So if North Dakota opens up May 1 but New York doesn’t open up until November 1, you have the possibility for New Yorkers to get skimped.”
Looming over the discussion is the question of what happens if the pandemic ultimately prevents the bureau from conducting a full enough survey by year’s end.
“What does doing a Census mean if the actual data are too compromised for it to be recognized as an actual enumeration?” Levitt said, adding, “There’s nothing that says you can’t do a census more than every 10 years.”
However, he said, it is too soon to declare defeat. “I don’t think that we’re at the point that a request for an extension means failure yet,” he said. “Right now, we might need a little extra time to finish the homework assignment.”"

Biden will appear on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” for an interview on Friday morning. The network promoted the interview as the venue in which the former vice president would “respond for the first time to the recent allegation of sexual assault.”
Biden’s campaign, which has denied the allegation, had no immediate comment. But Biden’s expected November opponent, President Trump, said during a White House coronavirus event on Thursday that Biden “should respond.”
Trump said he “didn’t know anything about” the allegation by former Senate aide Tara Reade, and suggested that her account could be a “false accusation.”
“I know all about false accusations. I’ve been falsely charged numerous times,” Trump said. More than 20 women have accused the president of sexual misconduct, ranging from the late 1970s through 2016, when he was a presidential candidate.
Trump has denied the allegations. In a 2005 tape obtained by The Washington Post less than a month before his election, Trump bragged in vulgar terms about assaulting women by grabbing them between the legs.
“And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump said on the “Access Hollywood” tape. “You can do anything.”
Trump said Thursday that Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was “falsely charged” during his nomination hearings of sexually assaulting a woman when they were both teenagers in high school.
“What happened with him was an absolutely disgrace to the country,” Trump said.
Over the past week, Democrats have increasingly indicated they want to hear Biden address the allegations after weeks of silence on the matter. His refusal to discuss it has put other Democrats in the position of defending him while also advocating that women alleging sexual harassment or assault should be supported.
Biden has taken part in several interviews as the allegations gained attention, but was not asked about them. The subject also did not come up in several recent events he has held, including a “Virtual Women’s Town Hall” with Hillary Clinton on Tuesday and a 40-minute conversation Thursday on Instagram Live with the soccer star Megan Rapinoe.
Biden has declined a request for an interview with The Washington Post, as his campaign defended the former vice president.
“He firmly believes that women have a right to be heard — and heard respectfully,” deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said. “Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press. What is clear about this claim: It is untrue. This absolutely did not happen.”
Several of the women who are believed to be on Biden’s vice presidential list have declared that they believe his campaign’s denial. Other Democrats have refused to comment, with many neither defending him nor calling on him to explain further.
Last year, several women said Biden had been overly affectionate in a way that made them uncomfortable. Reade’s accusation that Biden in 1993 had reached under her skirt and penetrated her was the first allegation of sexual assault made against him.
Reade, who worked for Biden for nine months ending in 1993, said last year in interviews with The Post and with other outlets that Biden had put his hands on her shoulders and neck when she was working in his Senate office. She said that she had complained about it to more senior aides in the office, but those aides told The Post they had no recollection of Reade’s claim.
Last month, in a podcast interview, she alleged that the then-senator had assaulted her after pushing her against a wall somewhere on Capitol Hill.
The Post published an in-depth examination of her account two weeks ago in which one of her friends confirmed that Reade had told her of an incident shortly after she said it had occurred. Reade’s brother, Collin Moulton, also told The Post that she had told him in 1993 that Biden had touched her neck and shoulders. Several days after the interview, he said in a text message that he recalled her telling him that Biden had put his hand “under her clothes.”
In an interview published by Business Insider on Monday, Lynda LaCasse, a former acquaintance of Reade, said Reade had told her of an alleged assault in the mid-1990s, when they lived in the same California housing complex. LaCasse on Wednesday confirmed those details to The Post.
“She told me that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her,” she wrote in a text message. “She said that he had put her up against a wall, put his hand up her skirt and his fingers inside her.”
She added that she is “a very strong Democrat” and was supporting Biden for president.
“I believed Tara at the time she told me that Mr. Biden assaulted her, and I continue to support her now,” she wrote. “I feel that the truth needs to be told.”
Lorraine Sanchez, who worked with Reade in California after her tenure in Washington, told Business Insider that Reade had told her she “had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in DC and as a result of her voicing her concerns to her supervisors, she was let go, fired.” But Reade herself has given various reasons for her departure.
The corroboration from the women came several days after a 1993 call to Larry King’s CNN talk show surfaced.
In the clip, a woman whom Reade identified as her ­now-deceased mother called to report unspecified “problems” her daughter was having with her employer, whom she called “a prominent senator.” The caller said her daughter did not want to go public with her account “out of respect for” the unnamed senator."

Do us a favor though: Before we rescue the U.S. Postal Service, raise postage prices on the president’s perceived political enemies.
Do us a favor though: Before we assist states in fiscal crisis, reopen your economies when we say so. Oh, and hand over your immigrants.
A more public-service-oriented president might view a viral pandemic as a time to prioritize saving lives and providing services and funds wherever needed. But to President Trump, the coronavirus outbreak is just another opportunity for a shakedown.
This should have been obvious, given how he exploited another country’s crisis.
Last summer, as Ukraine was desperate for aid that Congress had appropriated but that the Trump administration had frozen, Trump held his “perfect phone call” with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump told Zelensky, per the rough transcript: “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.”
He then asked for Zelensky’s help in smearing a domestic political rival.
To many voters, this exchange, involving a faraway country, may have seemed no different from the usual horse-trading that U.S. officials conduct with counterparts abroad. Trump calls himself a brilliant dealmaker, after all; maybe this episode was just another boring political negotiation.
It wasn’t, of course. It was about extracting a favor designed to help the president’s personal interest, rather than his country’s.
In December, during the impeachment hearings, Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan offered an analogy explaining why Trump’s extortion attempt should be troubling.
“Imagine living in a part of Louisiana or Texas that’s prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding,” Karlan testified. “What would you think if, when your governor asked the federal government for the disaster assistance that Congress has provided, the president responded, ‘I would like you to do us a favor. I’ll meet with you and send the disaster relief once you brand my opponent a criminal’?”
That hypothetical might once have seemed ludicrous. Now, like the Onion’s March joke about Trump someday recommending bleach ingestion, it looks prophetic. To be sure, the current disaster isn’t weather-related, and the quid pro quo demanded doesn’t involve branding Trump’s opponent a criminal, per se.
Nonetheless, Trump appears to be salivating over the personal “favors” he might wring from distressed parties now needing his help.
In late March, for instance, he suggested that provision of medical supplies to states would be conditional on praise from governors. “It’s a two-way street,” he said on Fox News. “They have to treat us well, also. They can’t say, ‘Oh, gee, we should get this, we should get that.’ ”
Days later, in a White House press briefing, he urged Vice President Pence not to call governors who were insufficiently “appreciative”: “If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call.”
The gambit seems to have worked. At another news conference weeks later, he screened a montage of groveling governors lavishing him with praise, in what seemed awfully close to a campaign ad.
Last week, when asked about helping the troubled U.S. Postal Service, he issued another crisis-enabled ultimatum: no aid unless the USPS quadruples prices on packages.
“If they don’t raise the price, I’m not signing anything,” Trump told reporters. He specifically and repeatedly mentioned the need to raise prices on Amazon.
Which, again, isn’t a surprise. Trump has allegedly sought before to use his office to punish Amazon — through antitrust, government procurement and, yes, postage rates. This appears to be because Trump is unhappy with coverage in The Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. While pressuring the USPS to jack up prices is likely to hurt rural Trump voters, and possibly increase financial stress for the agency, doing so still might be his best chance to retaliate against a perceived political foe.
Meanwhile, in the weeks since that initial ventilator shakedown, states and counties have begun facing severe fiscal strain. Revenue shortfalls are worsening, and Trump has so far refused to endorse more federal relief.
Initially, White House aides said Trump was withholding aid to maintain pressure on states to reopen. This week, Trump offered another precondition for assistance: If state and local officials want money, they must first get rid of “sanctuary city” policies. This would of course be a major political win for Trump, even if it potentially makes life in these cities more dangerous.
Once upon a time, Americans might have dismissed Ukraine’s troubles as irrelevant to their lives. Well, we’re all Zelensky now"
"May 1, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/despite-the-rocky-publicity-the-small-business-loan-program-is-really-working/2020/04/30/970357ce-8b0e-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html,The Washington Post,"Despite the rocky publicity, the small-business loan program is really working","Media coverage of the federal government’s efforts to help small businesses has focused lately on big companies’ grabbing loans that were meant to help smaller ones weather the novel coronavirus economic shutdown. But the numbers from the Cares Act’s Paycheck Protection Program are coming in, and they’re impressive.
On April 3, the Small Business Administration launched the PPP with $349 billion. The SBA’s most recent report says that through April 16, the agency approved nearly 1.7 million loans through 4,975 lenders, depleting the entire fund. According to SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza, the agency “processed more than 14 years’ worth of loans in less than 14 days.” By any measure, that’s lightning speed. And now a new tranche of money is in the pipeline.
It turns out that just 1.6 percent of total PPP loans were for $2 million or more, coming to a total of about $95 billion, according to the SBA — some of those loans presumably going to large firms that weren’t the legislation’s intended beneficiaries. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has announced that the government will perform a full audit of any company with a loan of $2 million or more, and companies that took loans they didn’t need could be “subject to criminal liability.” A number of companies have already repaid their loans.
For the most part, these PPP loans appear to be actually reaching the small businesses as intended. Loans for less than $150,000 account for 74 percent of total loans — and 96 percent were for less than $1 million. The average loan was $206,000.
But is the money helping? As the former chief executive of CKE Restaurants, with about 200 franchisees, and a former director of the International Franchise Association, I’ve been hearing from a lot of nervous small-business owners since the beginning of the economic shutdown.
While the Cares Act was pending in Congress, most were concerned about whether their business would qualify for the loans. Once it passed, covering a broad swath of small businesses, you could almost hear the collective sigh of relief. But something close to panic set in when many businesses were unable to find a lender willing to make a PPP loan. It seemed that the bigger the bank, the more difficult the process. This concern also passed fairly rapidly when community banks — and some larger banks — stepped up and started making the loans.
Unfortunately, not all small businesses received loans before the program ran out of funds. A James Beard Foundation survey of more than 1,800 owners of predominantly small and independent restaurants found that while 41 percent of the respondents had been approved for a loan, nearly half (45 percent) of those approved had not received funding. After an inexcusable delay by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the Trump administration and Congress added $310 billion to the PPP to address the demand.
One looming problem: the lack of certainty about how businesses can qualify for loan forgiveness. For example, how much of the loan proceeds must employers spend on payroll, and over what period of time? But there is a sense that the Trump administration recognizes the problem and will soon issue regulatory guidance to clarify the requirements.
With the PPP loans made so far, and with more money being disbursed, thousands of small businesses that would otherwise have closed permanently will remain open, their employees either still at work or more confident that their employer will be in business and rehiring once the crisis abates. According to Mnuchin, the PPP has already benefited 30 million workers, and the administration expects “it will be another 30 million workers by the time we get done with this, so close to 50 percent of the private payroll.” Having these businesses and jobs intact will help smooth the country’s return to economic strength.
One more piece of good news on the restaurant front: The dramatic sales declines of a few weeks ago seem to be waning. When the shutdown began, restaurant franchisees I have spoken with were complaining of disastrous sales declines in the 30 to 40 percent range. Over the past couple of weeks, those complaints have dropped to more survivable 5 to 15 percent declines. As the covid-19 crisis continues, consumers may become increasingly comfortable with the safety of drive-through, curbside or delivery service. But franchisees tell me that they attribute the improved sales to the government checks that have gone out to help individuals in recent weeks. Even if temporary, this is a much-needed lift.
In the long term, government intervention is no substitute for the economy. The best way to speed the recovery would be a return to policies that encourage private-sector investment, growth and work. The Cares Act was designed to make a short-term economic stop sustainable and a soft landing possible, not to permanently change the way the United States does business. The good news is that it appears to be working."
