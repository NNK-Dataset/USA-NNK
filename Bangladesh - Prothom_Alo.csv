"18 Mar,2020",https://en.prothomalo.com/corporate/global/uber-lyft-suspend-pooled-rides-in-us-canada-amid-corona-outbreak,Prothom Alo,"Uber, Lyft suspend pooled rides in US, Canada amid corona outbreak","Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc Tuesday began suspending shared rides on their ride-hailing platforms in the United States and Canada to limit the spread of the coronavirus.Uber also said it has suspended its shared rides services in London and Paris.The pooled option, which allows riders to book trips at lower prices by sharing the car with up to three other passengers traveling in the same direction, has been disabled for users opening the apps.
“Our goal is to help flatten the curve on community spread in the cities we serve,” senior vice president Uber Rides and Platform Andrew Macdonald said in a statement.
A spokesman said similar steps outside the two countries would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Regular rides and the company’s food delivery platform, Uber Eats, remain available, but Uber said it was in contact with local authorities to adjust operations as needed.North America provides the bulk of Uber’s revenue, but pooled rides make up only a small share of all bookings, data by US cities showed.
Lyft, Uber’s smaller competitor operating only in the United States and Canada, said in a statement on Tuesday that it was also suspending all shared rides.
“The health and safety of the Lyft community is our top priority, and we’re dedicated to doing what we can to slow the spread of COVID-19,” the company said.
A larger share of Lyft’s rides are shared compared to Uber’s, but still make up less than a third of all trips, city data showed.
The new coronavirus that causes respiratory illness has spread quickly throughout the United States, killing more than 80 people and infecting more than 4,700.
The federal government has urged people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. Some state and local authorities have closed bars, restaurants and other venues to try and slow the spread of the virus.Beginning on Tuesday, Uber users in the United States and Canada will also see a message reminding them to consider if the ride they plan to book is essential and to “travel only when necessary,” images provided by Uber showed.Riders are also being asked to consider the safety of their drivers by washing their hands before and after a ride, sitting in the back seat and rolling down the window to improve ventilation.Uber has previously said it will compensate drivers and delivery people diagnosed with coronavirus or placed in quarantine by health officials for up to 14 days.

"21 Mar,2020",https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/interview/corona-cripples-tour-operators-2,Prothom Alo,Corona cripples tour operators,"The tourism industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. Most trips, tours and bookings are being cancelled. President of the Tour Operators Association of Bangladesh (TOAB) Md Rafeuzzaman speaks to Prothom Alo about the present predicament of the sector.What is the state of the tourism industry in Bangladesh following the coronavirus outbreak?The tourism sector is hit the hardest in times of any calamity. In November last year the first coronavirus patient was detected in China. After China, this spread to Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia.Many people come to Bangladesh and also travel abroad during winter as the weather is pleasant and schools are also closed at this time. So December to February is the peak tourist season. But coronavirus has crushed our business. The virus has spread extensively in all European countries as well as in the US and other countries. Air links with most countries have been suspended. People are too scared to go out. Many countries have out an embargo on travel. Travellers are cancelling their bookings. Corona has crippled the tour operators.Local tourists use the tour operator services too. What about local tourism?A big chunk of our business comes from local tourism, but there has been a negative impact here too. The local administration has prohibited public gatherings at Cox's Bazar, Khagrachhari, Bandarban and Kuakata due to corona. Of course, we support this decision in the greater interests of the country. Though it is harming our business, we are not offering any tour packages for local tourism. We are not marketing our services in this regard. We do not want people to go around the country through the tour operators in this time of coronavirus.The government should provide incentives to the sector. If that is not possible, then they can provide interest-free loans on easy terms. Also, if taxes and the annual civil aviation fees as exempted, this will be a huge relief.
Md Rafeuzzaman, President, TOAB.What percentage of the bookings of your association's 700 members has been cancelled?One hundred percent of the overseas bookings have been cancelled, both to the country and out of the country. In a package, a tour operator arranges for the air ticket, hotel booking, guide, travel and sightseeing for the tourist. With these bookings being cancelled, everyone is facing financial losses. Saudi Airlines and a handful of others are not taking refunds fees when the tickets are being cancelled.the other airlines are imposing the refund charge and so the tour operators are requesting the clients not to cancel their bookings, but to postpone these instead. The clients are not agreeing to this and are cancelling their bookings. The tour operators have having to refund the clients' money and are facing losses.ng the clients not to cancel their bookings, but to postpone these instead. The clients are not agreeing to this and are cancelling their bookings. The tour operators have having to refund the clients' money and are facing losses.Are tour operators going to lay off staff in order to salvage their business during this corona crisis?The tour operators have failed to do any business during the peak season because of corona and so we decided to send 25 to 30 per cent of our employees on retirement with financial benefits. But we are reconsidering this decision on humanitarian grounds. We have asked our member operators not to lay off any employees for the next two months. If necessary, we will send our personal property to pay our staff wages. But if corona continues even after that, then we will not survive.
Taking China's experience into consideration, it will take at least two months or more for the virus to subside. Under the circumstances, what sort of support do you want from the government?Tour operators are bringing in foreign remittance without harming the environment in any way and so given the circumstances, the government should provide incentives to the sector. If that is not possible, then they can provide interest-free loans on easy terms. Also, if taxes and the annual civil aviation fees as exempted, this will be a huge relief. Though 80 per cent of our preparation had been done, we had to postpone our international fair due to coronavirus. TOAB has faced huge financial loses because of this. We will need the government's financial support in future to hold this exposition.

"20 Mar,2020",https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/editorial/no-need-to-hoard-in-corona-fear,Prothom Alo,No need to hoard in corona fear,"Our main task at the moment is to try our best to deal with the coronavirus outbreak that has plagued the world. The virus is not yet widespread in Bangladesh but this is the time we must try to prevent the spread at all levels- public, private, institutional and family.In addition to preventing the virus, we must take into account the problems that may arise as a consequence of this crisis. One such outcome is the price hike of consumer products. People have been purchasing and hoarding goods more than they need, including rice and dal (pulses). Such pictures have appeared in the media over the past few days.There is no need to stock up on essentials as the government has said time and again that our markets have adequate supply of consumer products. We have been seeing that there was no evidence of any shortage of products until a few days ago.Under the circumstances, if everyone starts to buy consumer goods in excess, we will be the reason of the crisis that may arise in the market. At this moment when we should be striving to prevent the outbreak of coronavirus, we will create an additional crisis on our own, and the consequences will not be good for anyone.Commerce minister Tipu Munshi has urged the consumers who are terrified of coronavirus not to purchase extra goods, saying that all commodities and supplies are adequate in the country. We should be conscious of the rumours and make others aware of these. The problem in Bangladesh is the public cannot always trust the government.Previous experience says the government never reveals accurate information. In such a situation it becomes difficult for the public to get an accurate idea of ​​reality. Until the second week of March, the supply of goods in the consumer markets was normal. The consumers could have easily known that. But the assurance of commerce minister seems to have no impact on the sudden rush to purchase consumer goods that has arisen out of coronavirus fear.First of all, people do not trust the government assurance. Secondly, in such situations, some unscrupulous traders are using the situation to make extra profits. As a result, there will be two types of problems. On the one hand, people in anxiety will store consumer goods for the days ahead. On the other hand, unscrupulous traders will hoard consumer goods to further the crisis.It is the responsibility of the government to handle this situation in the sternest way. We must ensure that no one gets any opportunity to hoard goods. Leaders of trade organisations can assist the government in this. The people should follow the trade minister’s request: refrain from buying excess consumer goods.

"16 Mar,2020",https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/love-gives-hope-in-the-time-of-corona,Prothom Alo,Love gives hope in the time of corona,"Gabriel Garcia Marques' novel 'Love in the Time of Cholera' shows the fairy tale of real life, where people can make such a difference. In the time of corona, while the virus distances us from each other, we can draw close in a different way.Students are making masks and distributing them free of cost. A young street vendor in Dhaka has set an example but not taking advantage of the situation and instead continues selling masks at the original price.In Italy, quarantined in their homes, the Italians are singing to their neighbours from their balconies, sending around the message of love. In times where one cannot visit each other, come into contact with each other, such initiatives lift the heart.In China, thousands of volunteers, at the risk of their lives are gathering at Wuhan to clean the city and make it safe. China may have punished the first physician who warned of the virus, the columnist who cautioned the government, but these persons had done a great service to humanity. These examples must be spread.In 'The Decameron', written 600 years ago, it was said that during the Black Death epidemic how citizen avoided citizen, how neighbours scarcely found fellow-feeling for another, how kinspersons held aloof and never met, how fathers and mothers were found to abandon their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate.In times of natural disaster, people come together. When there are floods, fire, storms and earthquakes, people rush to the rescue. But corona is anti-social, it goes against proximity. When each and every one is a potential germ carrier, this is just a matter of survival. Even a loved one, if affected, creates fear. But a mother won't abandon her child. Everyone should nurture such love. Others' health means my own health, the health of my family. The policy today should be 'live and let live'.Disasters can bring out the worst in us, but it is also a time to bring out the best. There is no point in fearing corona and seeing others as a threat. Such a great crisis cannot be managed without the values of serving others and having faith in humanity.
Corona is more dangerous for the elderly. Their resistance against disease is low. And the people of a country with a weak health system are also vulnerable. And this is such a sickness that you can't even go abroad for treatment. No one will take you.New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that epidemics kill compassion. It weakens society. In 'The Decameron', written 600 years ago, it was said that during the Black Death epidemic how citizen avoided citizen, how neighbours scarcely found fellow-feeling for another, how kinspersons held aloof and never met, how fathers and mothers were found to abandon their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate.Generally speaking, even if thousands of people die in an epidemic, no one talks about it in the next century. Life starts again as if nothing happened. No one wants to remember how the disaster had made people so inhuman, how so many people had to suffer and die alone. But writers have captured those times in their words.
Jose Saragamo's novel 'Blindness' stripped away all veneers of civilisation when it showed how people even stopped looking at each other when an epidemic spread where people were losing their eyesight. The writings of Sharatchandra and Tarashankar about the epidemics of the last century do not evoke hope.It is like a war in which everyone is against the other. Everyone eyes each other with suspicion, as a contagion. It is all about protecting your own hand and avoiding the hands of others. Fear feeds on itself. Fear is an epidemic. People turn to all sorts of talismans, drugs, false hope and religious dogma in their state of fear.
Presently we see people returning from Italy and other countries and it was known in advance that they would be arriving. But how are they being kept? Hardly under any humanitarian conditions. Why have they been forced to stay in such poor conditions with their children? Many people on Facebook are expressing their hatred towards those returning from abroad. If the government and the people are reacting to just this number of people in such a manner, how will they deal with things if the situation grows?Masks and hand sanitizers are scarce in the market. Traders are hiking price. People are being hoodwinked by false propaganda on YouTube. What are the government's steps under the circumstances? How are they planning to tackle the crisis ahead? The people have the right to know. Covering up the truth, propagating false news, will just make the situation worse. Iran and China are examples.Just as death by AIDS or in road accidents are part of the times, epidemics are also becoming a part of life. If corona goes, dengue will come. Modern lifestyles and economy have destroyed life as it is, and now new health risks have cropped up. Just as a government prepares its troops to protect the state, now preparation must be made for public health risks. Just as there are permanent programmes in place to deal with AIDS and diabetes, there needs to be preparation to deal with this.If reality is revealed, fear is replaced by responsibility. If we see the state is going all out to tackle the crisis, if we see that the spiral of prices is being controlled, if we see measures are being taken to ensure the availability of essentials, if care facilities are provided for the isolated and ailing, then people's confidence will grow.At the end of the day the question looms large, what has globalisation given us. What has digitation civilisation given us? Globalisation may have strengthened capital, but has failed to unite people of the world. The World Health Organisation has declared a pandemic, but who will draw up rules and regulations and ensure that all the governments abide by these? Global economy has taken a nose dive, how will we deal with that? How prepared are we to ensure food for the poor, nutrition for the children and health for the people if the situation deteriorates? It is not as if things will continue as before and corona will disappear.If a neighbour's house catches fire, so will your own. In the same way, the health of all around us is a precondition to our own good health. Corona will one day be defeated and life will go on. That is why it is vital to keep people, society and humanitarian values alive, even in quarantine."
"16 Mar,2020",https://en.prothomalo.com/entertainment/hollywood/us-box-office-plunges-to-lowest-level-amid-corona-outbreak,Prothom Alo,US box office plunges to lowest level amid corona outbreak,"Much of public life in the United States essentially ground to a halt this week. In the entertainment world, theme parks shut down, Broadway went dark, studios pulled major tentpoles from their release calendar, and virtually all Hollywood movies and TV shows halted production as coronavirus continues to rapidly spread across North America.The exhibition industry, a sector of the film business reliant on the communal experience, has been the one institution reluctant to entirely close its doors amid the ongoing public heath crisis. Prior to Friday, fears of coronavirus didn’t appear to impact moviegoing. But this weekend’s box office results display that significantly fewer people are going to their local multiplex.Ticket sales in North America hit the lowest levels in over two decades, generating roughly $55.3 million between Friday and Sunday. Only one movie, Disney-Pixar’s “Onward,” made more than $10 million over the weekend. The last time revenues were this depressed was a weekend in mid-September of 2000 ($54.5 million). The steep decline pushed the year-to-date box office down almost 9%, according to Comscore.
Domestic receipts were inevitably going to plummet this weekend because AMC and Regal, two of the biggest movie theater chains, and several other circuits like Alamo Drafthouse and Arclight, cut capacity in individual auditoriums by 50% to avoid crowding. Reducing the number of tickets sold per theater helped multiplexes comply with Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for “social distancing.” Theaters also kept room between rows and seats to ensure patrons had ample space.So in all, low ticket sales were a combination of audiences staying home and theaters capping seating capacity.“The impact of this unprecedented situation was apparent across many industries,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst with Comscore. “Of course, movie theaters, amidst reduced capacity and an ever-evolving set of circumstances, had a very challenging weekend.”Last weekend’s champion, Disney-Pixar’s “Onward,” remained the No. 1 movie at the domestic box office, as three new films opened to varying degrees of disappointment. “Onward” pulled in $10.5 million in its second outing, a brutal 73% decline from its inaugural weekend. After two weeks of release, “Onward” has made $60.8 million in North America and $101 million globally.Faith-based drama “I Still Believe,” from Lionsgate and Kingdom Story Company, pulled in the biggest haul among newcomers and placed second on box office charts. The film, starring KJ Apa as Christian singer Jeremy Camp, earned $9.5 million from 3,250 theaters, slightly below expectations. “I Still Believe” was directed by brothers Andrew and Jon Erwin, whose last collaboration, 2018’s “I Can Only Imagine,” debuted to $17 million and ended up grossing $86 million. “I Still Believe” has an “A” CinemaScore and is performing strongest in the south and midwest. Among opening weekend audiences, 74% were female and 73% were over the age of 25.Sony’s superhero thriller “Bloodshot,” starring Vin Diesel, launched at No. 3, bringing in $9.3 million from 2,861 venues. Though only slightly behind the studio’s projections, it’s still a disappointing result for a film that cost $45 million to produce. “Bloodshot”—which earned a “B” CinemaScore from audiences—was co-financed by Columbia Pictures, Bona Film Group and Cross Creek Pictures. Diesel has had trouble attracting crowds to non-“Fast and Furious” endeavors, although in this case, the virus certainly didn’t help draw ticket buyers.“The Hunt,” an R-rated political satire from Universal and Blumhouse, came in fifth place with $5.3 million from 3,028 locations, about half of what was expected heading into the weekend. It carries a $14 million price tag. “The Hunt” had been the subject of controversy since it was initially slated for last September. But Universal scrapped its release in wake of three mass shootings, as well as intense media scrutiny after President Donald Trump criticized it on Twitter. The film, meant to poke fun at the divide between red and blue states, follows elites who kidnap and prey on average Americans for sport. In an early trailer, those being hunted were referred to as “deplorables.” Universal turned the turmoil into a marketing play, calling it the “most talked about movie of the year that nobody has seen... yet.” However, once moviegoers did watch “The Hunt,” they seemed somewhat apathetic. It has a “C+” CinemaScore and a 54% average on Rotten Tomatoes.“The Hunt” came in behind fellow studio release, “The Invisible Man,” now in its third frame. The Elisabeth Moss-led sci-fi thriller generated $6 million, enough for the No. 4 spot. So far, “The Invisible Man” has a cumulative tally of $64.4 million in the U.S. and Canada and $122 million worldwide.Though most theaters in North America remain open to some degree, China, South Korea, Italy and other areas greatly impacted by coronavirus have either completely or partially have shuttered multiplexes for weeks. The mass closures have already resulted in billions of dollars in lost revenues.In light of concerns over coronavirus, exhibitors in the U.S. that stayed open for business took extra precautions to increase sanitation. That included sterilizing seats, arm rests and cup holders more frequently and disinfecting all hand-contact surfaces during peak times.Studio executives and media analysts recognize the global box office is in uncharted territory, with crucial developments unfolding at a rapid pace. By last Thursday, most major Hollywood films that were set to hit theaters over the next two months—including Disney’s “Mulan,” Paramount’s “A Quiet Place Part II,” Universal’s “Fast 9” and MGM’s “No Time to Die”—had been removed from release calendars as the virus’s infection rate continues to increase. That means even if theaters do keep the lights on, the volume of content available will have dramatically shrunk."

On Saturday, less than a week away from release date, the film’s producer Yash Raj Films (YRF) tweeted to inform: “Given the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the country, we have decided to postpone the release of Dibakar Banerjee’s Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar. The health and safety of everyone is of utmost importance at this time.”“Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar” has been jinxed by delay in schedule, Unconfirmed reports state that the film was originally scheduled to open over a year ago. It was finally readied for release next Friday, but it seems like Parineeti and Arjun will have to wait a while longer for their film to see light of day, once the COVID 19 storm passes away.The two actors worked together in the 2012 release “Ishaqzaade”, which marked Arjun’s Bollywood debut. The film was critically acclaimed. They reunited in the 2018 release, “Namaste England”, which performed below expectations.Parineeti and Arjun’s third outing together, “Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar”, marks Dibakar Banerjee’s return as director to the Bollywood screen for the first time since the 2015 release, “Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!” Parineeti plays a corporate executive named Sandeep Kaur while Arjun is Pinky Dahiya, a policeman. The duo go absconding under unusual circumstances."
"9 Mar,20",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/padma-bridge-progresses-amid-corona-scare,Prothom Alo,Padma Bridge progresses amid corona scare,"Thirty-year-old Solaiman Khan is a driver at the Padma Bridge project. He is from Bagerhat but has been living in Mawra, Munshiganj, from 17 January 2015 after construction of the bridge began. On the first day of his job, Solaiman stood on the banks of Padma, gazing out at the strong current. Even the larger vessels have a hard time going down the river.Then after the monsoon, sand bars emerged here and there during winter and he would wonder how such a massive bridge would be built over the river. But with the passage of time, Solaiman is seeing the bridge emerge before his eyes.As he drives back and forth between the Padma Bridge project office in Dogachhi, Mawra to the Kumarbhog construction yard several times a day, he mutters, “The bridge is almost complete!” He hopes he will be able to drive from Mawra to Shariatpur on the very day the bridge is inaugurated.Padma Bridge is no longer a dream. It is a reality. Every day progress is made. From the outset the project had seen all sorts of hurdles and things were delayed. And now with the emergence of coronavirus, there is likely to be further delay, road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader hinted.On Tuesday, the bridge's 26th span will be put into place.On the morning of 3 March Solaiman was standing by Pier No 1. He pointed to the river, saying, “Look, you can see how Padma Bridge will look. The whole bridge will appear very soon.”He said his was a temporary job with the project and he would have to leave and search for a new job once the bridge was complete. Won’t he feel bad?“Why will I feel bad?” he exclaimed, “It is a dream and not just mine alone. It is everybody’s dream. I am from Bagerhat and it was difficult to go home. It took forever to cross this wide river. Once the bridge is complete, it will take just 10 minutes. Just imagine, I will be able to go to Bagerhat in just three hours!”Head of the Padma Bridge project’s expert committee, Jamilur Reza Chowdhury, told Prothom Alo that work on the bridge may be delayed if the Chinese workers are not released from quarantine to join their work. Also, there will be problems if construction material does not come in time from China. This has not had an impact so far but work may be affected after couple of weeks if the coronavirus situation does not improve.We started out by speedboat with Solaiman Khan at 12 noon from Mawra, headed towards Jajira. The light rain had cleared, giving way to a blue sky. The river was calm. We could see parts of the bridge as we went down the river.So far 25 spans had been placed on 26 piers. From afar it looked like combs had been placed upside down on the river. Piers 10, 26 and 27 jutted out of the water mid-river. On 8 March, pier no 10 had been completed. There was a pontoon attached to pier no 26 where a large vessel was anchored. The workers were climbing from there onto the bridge. Some remained in the vessel, having their lunch. From the top of the pier it was apparent that each of these piers was equal in height to a 10-storey building. The spans were being placed upon these. The bridge was massive. This was quite evident from pier no 26. It would be cemented soon. The Bangladeshi workers were standing talking to the Chinese engineers. They communicated in words and gestures.
Md Rakib Hossain, a local worker, had picked up quite a lot of Chinese. He said, “I began working on pier no 37 in 2015. I have worked on 10 or 12 more piers since then. I didn’t understand Chinese at first, but now I understand quite a lot.”Around 500 feet away from pier 26, work was going on at pier 27. Pier 28's construction was complete. Spans had been placed from pier 29 to all the way to pier 42. Work continued.Trains would run along the two-storey Padma Bridge. Vehicles would run above. Railway slabs had been placed by cranes between the spans. Workers easily carried heavy construction material up steel stairs stretching up around 10 storeys high. The railway line would be laid towards the end. Trains would travel at 80 km down the track along the bridge.

Detecting people who have already been attacked by the virus and quarantining people who have returned from abroad are two key issues, but the authorities have fallen short. But the hospitals do not have necessary equipment to test the patients or provide them with the required service.When we say protection we mean ensuring that for everyone -- from physicians to nurses to the cleaners. We have seen that many physicians and hospital staff had tested positive across the globe while a number of them died in China, Iran and Italy. From 18 March, 5 physicians and 13 hospital staff have died in Italy while 2500 have been attacked by the virus.In our country, the risk is high for both the physicians and the hospital staff. Usually most of the hospitals treat patients more than the capacity and many even have to stay at the floor or the balcony as they get their treatment while they are accompanied by their friends and relatives.We need to keep in mind that thousands of patients are going to the hospitals everyday and the physicians and nurses are treating them. We are not sure if any of the patients have coronavirus and if the hospital staffs are getting affected. We do not even have the kits to test and know who have the virus. The number of physicians and nurses in our country is also very few compared to the requirement.In this situation, a physician contacting coronavirus means many patients not getting his service. They do not only treat coronavirus patients, but they also attend to patients with other complications as well. In a nutshell, the entire healthcare system depends on their wellbeing.But we have not seen the authorities take it seriously. Although the government always said necessary measures had been taken, we see the hospitals are yet to get personal protection equipment. Not only the doctors and hospital staff where coronavirus patients are being treated, every single hospital in the country should get the PPE to ensure the maximum protection.

"10 Apr,2020",https://en.prothomalo.com/science-technology/science/44-vaccines-70-drugsyet-a-long-journey-to-corona-drug,Prothom Alo,"44 vaccines, 70 drugs—yet a long journey to corona druga","As top drug makers, scientists and independent researchers join an unprecedented race to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes deadly COVID-19 disease, the ordinary souls are left confused, grappling with claims making rounds on social media as if a COVID-19 drug or a vaccine is just around the corner.The stark truth is: There is absolutely none.The piecemeal efforts are currently on in various countries, but a coordinated global vaccine development effort is nowhere to be seen.According to Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance in Geneva, unless “we take a global perspective and ensure that everyone has access to future COVID-19 vaccines, this virus will keep coming back.“And in a race like that, there are no winners,” he tweeted on Wednesday.In an article in UK-based The Spectator, Berkley said: “Without global coordination, there is a danger that we could end up facing immediate Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates has announced his foundation is paying for the construction of facilities that will manufacture seven promising coronavirus vaccines and the best two vaccines would be picked for final trials.In India, the Serum Institute of India has collaborated with New York-based Codagenix Inc to develop a vaccine against the deadly respiratory virus.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 42 vaccines are in pre-clinical stage while only two have entered Phase 1.
The two vaccines which are in Phase 1 are from CanSino Biological Inc. and Beijing Institute of Biotechnology; and Moderna/the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) in the US.From Zydus Cadila to Moderna, from Sanofi Pasteur to Sinovac—and several prestigious universities like Imperial College London and University of Oxford in between—the efforts are on to develop a vaccine, but all are currently in just preclinical stages.Those 44 vaccines use a wide range of delivery platforms and techniques to protect our bodies from Sars-CoV-2 virus.
According to experts, the COVID-19 vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, so there is no need to jump on every occasion someone announces a new one.“We need to set aside nationalistic and financial interests when tackling Covid-19. Instead, we need a global, publicly funded, ‘Big Science’ approach that encourages collaboration and the sharing of information and resources,” stressed Berkley.“Like the Human Genome Project, the Large Hadron Collider and other Big Science projects, this approach would allow the world to make significant advances more quickly and efficiently than could be achieved through piecemeal efforts,” he added.Apart from vaccines, nearly 70 drugs and experimental cocktails are being examined. The WHO has announced a global trial called ‘SOLIDARITY’ to find out if any drug can actually treat infections with the new coronavirus.Scientists have suggested dozens of existing compounds for testing, but WHO is focusing on what it says are the four most promising therapies.These are “an experimental antiviral compound called remdesivir; the malaria medications chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir; and that same combination plus interferon-beta, an immune system messenger that can help cripple viruses,” said the article in the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).California-based biotechnology company Gilead Sciences says it is ready with 1.5 million individual doses of promising remdesivir drug against COVID-19 disease for compassionate use, expanded access and clinical trials.
Remdesivir is still an investigational medicine and has not been approved by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.US president Donald Trump made Hydroxychloroquine a wonder drug, but there are conflicting reports, available data are thin and results from COVID-19 patients are murky.A study that first claimed that anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for the novel coronavirus has now been slammed by the same society that publishes the journal in which the paper first appeared.The Scotland-based nonprofit International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC) has stressed that the study in question that appeared in its International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA) “did not meet its standard”.
In Berkley’s viewpoint: “It’s clear now that vaccination is the only way to end this pandemic and return to a more normal life, so we need take steps to ensure we don’t have a repeat of what happened in 2009 during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, where a small number of countries effectively hoarded the global supply of vaccines”.

One group is saying it’s the Creator who will eventually get rid of this ‘curse’, while the other group is betting on science.

Knowledge is a holistic idea. Piecemeal knowledge is not knowledge as such. Piecemeal knowledge is incomplete knowledge. The knowledge only which is tested in all branches of scholarship, which is proven rational in all branches of knowledge or which make sense in all branches of scholarship, like philosophy, sociology, biology, psychology, anthropology and mathematics, is knowledge per se.

Whether or not there is a Creator, is not an issue of science. It is an issue of social science. Social science, not science, is an overarching scholarship of human knowledge whereas science is only a discipline, mostly technical knowledge. Any discipline or any scholarship of knowledge or any knowledge connecting with humans or human society belongs to social science. All of the branches/disciplines of human knowledge together comprise social science. Social science is interdisciplinary knowledge while science is a single disciplinary knowledge.Again, there is a vast range of scholarship beyond science. Science comprises only a part, (max 10 to 20 to 30 per cent) of human knowledge (social knowledge). Science is ‘empirical knowledge’. There is a large volume of scholarship based on ‘inferred knowledge’ in social science, which is beyond the reach of science.Had the existence of the Creator [the Creator who has created you (if at all)] been proved in ‘empirical knowledge’, and had the Creator been so visible/so present in human life, then humans would have been under direct supervision of their Creator (who would be the absolute autocrat). Human civilisation would have been totally different from what it is today. Human communication would have been totally different.Science could not unravel hundreds of mysteries of the universe as yet. In science, the ‘work’ is calculated by multiplying ‘force’ by the ‘amount of movement’ of an object (W = FX D). For instance, if a group of people push a heavy rock for a whole day and if the rock is not moved, the science says that there has been no work done there. But the social science would for sure recognise that there has been some work, albeit no outcome. At the same time, the social science would also say that the effort ‘with apparently zero outcome’ has an outcome at the end of the day. The effort or the work will tell us as to why the rock was not moved. It would guide us to take next course of action.Humans will never be able to find their Creator with ‘empirical knowledge’ [i.e. science]. Had the existence of the Creator [the Creator who has created you (if at all)] been proved in ‘empirical knowledge’, and had the Creator been so visible/so present in human life, then humans would have been under direct supervision of their Creator (who would be the absolute autocrat). Human civilisation would have been totally different from what it is today. Human communication would have been totally different. So, if you would like to find the Creator, you will have to find Him through ‘inferred knowledge’, not in ‘empirical knowledge’, i.e. science. So, science alone would never be able to talk about the Creator.You, however, may get some signs in science which would give you some clues, at best. So, it’s not science’s business to say whether there is a Creator and what is a Creator and who is the Creator."
"24 Apr,2020",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/local-news/bibhutibhushan-the-gladiator-of-the-corona-days,Prothom Alo,Bibhutibhushan: The gladiator of the corona days,"The Barishal Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital started to do coronavirus tests on 29 March.Bibhutibhushan Halder, 30, a technologist of the hospital, has been relentlessly working on collecting samples since then, while many others have avoided the risky job.As of last Friday, Bibhutibhushan has collected samples from around 50 people.While most of the people are scared of coronavirus and are avoiding the infected people, Bibhutibhushan is an exception.His efforts have earned him the epithet of a ‘real hero’ in the fight against coronavirus among the health department officials of Barishal.The hospital authorities initially selected five people, including him for collecting samples.“My coworkers were frightened. Some shirked the responsibility giving various excuses while others discarded their names from the roaster by lobbying. And then I realized I would have to do it alone,” Bibhutibhushan said, sharing his experience of the initial days.Like his coworkers, Bibhutibhushan, too, was frightened to take such a risky job.“I couldn’t sleep well on the night of 28 March. I was frightened by the news of deaths. I was troubled to collect samples of such a dangerous virus that I had no experience of doing,” he said.“I once thought of avoiding the work showing any excuse. But then I thought someone must come forward in this time of crisis,” Bibhutibhushan added.On 29 March morning, Bibhutibhushan's parents and his elder brother were anxious, too.His mother Ranja Rani, with a trembling voice asked, ""Can’t you avoid the responsibility?""But she immediately changed her stance and said, “Okay, you should go. Those who are dying of the virus are also some mother's children. I’m sending you for their help.”Bibhutibhushan’s father Sudhangshu Halder, who retired as an assistant treasurer of the hospital six years back, said, “Everyone wasn't lucky enough to participate in the Liberation War. This fight against coronavirus is also a war. Not everyone will get an opportunity to take part in this battle. Go fight this, our blessings are with you.”Bibhutibhushan said he donned Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on 29 March and collected samples of two men.Since then, he has been working dawn to dusk till now.Treating coronavirus patients has its physiological toll.He cannot sleep well when he visualises the agony of the patients.Barishal health department’s assistant director Shyamol Krishna Mandal said, “Bibhutibhushan's courage makes us proud. We always pray that he remains fit and serve people.”Bibhutibhushan said he works for seven to eight hours every day at the coronavirus unit of the hospital.He has not gone to his home since 29 March considering the safety of the family members. He now lives in a room near the hospital.Barishal Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital’s director Bakir Hossain said, “Bibhutibhushan has come forward while others have escaped. He is working day and night despite the risk. Youths like him are real heroes. The way he’s working without any fear is unprecedented. We’re very proud of him."""

"2 May,2020",https://en.prothomalo.com/entertainment/music/corona-is-natures-revenge-akhi-alamgir,Prothom Alo,Corona is nature’s revenge: Akhi Alamgir,"All the trees in front of our house have been chopped down to make way for a power line. But actually we can protect nature and have development too. We don’t think of that. There simply is no environmental balance in this world. And I think corona is nature’s revenge. We are constantly destroying nature. We has not bothered to protect its natural beauty. We have been on a relentless drive of sound pollution, air pollution, deforestation, and destroying plants, trees, everything.We have achieved a lot of development, but have not realised that development was most urgently needed in the sectors of health, education and research. We are realising the dire need for an educated population and intelligent people. We are now being forced to think. This corona crisis will pass eventually. Life will begin anew, and then we will need to give serious thought to the problems that have been identified.I have been very scared. It is such a disease, that it spreads just by shaking hands, sitting side by side! How will people fight this invisible foe? The lack of answers is alarming. am staying at home. Waiting. Waiting to wake up one corona-free morning. I can’t wait to wake up one day and hear corona is no more, that the Creator has freed us from this virus.
That good news hasn’t arrived as yet. I still haven’t been able raise my hopes. Vaccine tests have begun in Britain. But there’s nothing much outside of that.In our country the number of corona cases are steadily increasing. I used to watch the news on television at the beginning, but I don’t anymore.We are living in a lockdown. How much can we sing in this sort of life, how much can be watch television, how can we spend time with our children! How will the children be able to keep their spirits up? They will grow restless. There is school, there are studies. My daughter was supposed to take her A Level exams this time and was dully prepared for the exams in May. She is thoroughly disconcerted. No one knows when the exams will take place.The government is paying attention to the garments sector and other sectors. It should look towards us too. The artistes always come forward during times of national calamity. Even now they are raising public awareness. The government must come forward for the artistes once this crisis is over.I think no one but our Creator can save us from this situation. If Allah forgives us all, then the virus will go away. We have no other weapon to destroy it. We have no idea how to fight it.Even after this corona period passes, it will take time for music, songs and entertainment to emerge. Other than a handful of artistes, most people of the music world will suffer. Many of the artists and musicians perhaps are not being able to speak out about their problems. But it is obvious that many of them are in trouble. We may live a life of glamour and glitz, but we spend whatever we earn. People don’t realise that. The artistes in our country aren’t millionaires. And if we are not earning, our funds will naturally dwindle.The government is paying attention to the garments sector and other sectors. It should look towards us too. The artistes always come forward during times of national calamity. Even now they are raising public awareness. The government must come forward for the artistes once this crisis is over.The seniors and leaders in the cultural arena must speak out. If a stimulus is given, it must be used properly. Those who in financial distress, must be helped to carry on for a few months. The government must increase its patronage for the artistes. The artistes are active even now at home, singing, mobilising public awareness. Many are helping those in distress, some secretly, come openly. They do so out of a sense of responsibility towards the country and the people.At these critical times of the country and the world, everyone must be empathetic,patient. We must get through this together. Once this is over, no one should feel hesitant to teach their children to sing. We cannot let our culture slip away. We must be vigilant about upholding and cherishing our culture."

Now the authorities are rolling out ""rice ATMs"" in a bid to ensure greater access for those in need to the essential Asian staple.This month Linda Syafri, a 28-year-old expectant mother was among the many who lined up in masks at a military base in Depok, on the outskirts of the capital Jakarta, for their 1.5 kilogram (3.3 lb) rice ration.
""I was laid off by my company last week and my husband was laid off too without severance pay,"" said Syafri. ""Although it (the rice subsidy) is not that much, it is very helpful in this situation.""The rice dispensary, one of 10 in and around Jakarta, is part of a government initiative to assist those worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which has caused millions to lose their jobs in Southeast Asia's largest economy.Stacked with kilos of good-quality rice and operated by magnetic cards, the tall automated teller machines look much like normal cashpoints, only that they pump out grain instead of banknotes.""Each day we prepare 1.5 tonnes (of rice) for around 1,000 residents,"" said Ibrahim, an army official supervising distribution who uses one name like many Indonesians. ""We will continue doing it every day, without rest, even on weekends, we will distribute non-stop.""Indonesia announced a $25 billion stimulus package in March in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, pledging to provide social welfare for up to 10 million households, including food assistance and electricity tariff discounts.Residents eligible for the rice ration include daily wage earners, the unemployed, those who do not own a house and people who live below the poverty line.
