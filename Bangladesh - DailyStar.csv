In China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated in late December, growth was projected to slow to 2.3% in the baseline scenario, or as low as 0.1% in the lower-case scenario, compared to growth of 6.1% in 2019.The region faced an unusual combination of ""disruptive and mutually reinforcing events,"" the report said. ""Significant economic pain seems unavoidable in all countries.""Countries in the region should invest in healthcare capacity and take targeted fiscal measures, such as providing subsidies for sick pay and healthcare, to mitigate some of the immediate impacts of the pandemic, the World Bank said.""Containment of the pandemic would allow for a sustained recovery in the region, although risks to the outlook from financial market stress would remain high,"" it said.
The financial shock of the pandemic was also expected to have a serious impact on poverty, defined as income of $5.50 a day, the bank said. The baseline scenario called for nearly 24 million fewer people to escape poverty across the region in 2020 due to the pandemic. If the economic situation deteriorated even further, poverty could increase by about 11 million people.Prior projections estimated that nearly 35 million people would escape poverty in the region in 2020, including over 25 million in China alone, the bank said.In addition to targeted fiscal measures, countries should look to deeper international cooperation and new cross-border public-private partnerships to ramp up the production and supply of key medical supplies and services, and ensure financial stability in the aftermath of the crisis, it said.
Countries should also ease credit to help households smooth their consumption and help firms survive the immediate shock of the outbreak.""The good news is that the region has strengths it can tap, but countries will have to act fast and at a scale not previously imagined,"" said Victoria Kwakwa, vice president for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank."

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) today announced that they will be supporting the women cricketers with financial incentive during these tough times.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced a one-time amount of BDT 20,000.00 to assist women cricketers who had appeared in the 2018-19 Women's NCL and have been in BCB's selection camps in 2019-20.All cricketing activities of the BCB including women's tournaments and training camps have been postponed indefinitely in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak.""Just like their male counterparts, the majority of women cricketers also look towards domestic events for an earning.

The BCB president had told The Daily Star yesterday that they were going to exercise extreme caution before starting cricketing activities.""We are going to maintain the highest level of caution.

"30 Mar,2020",https://www.thedailystar.net/usa-extends-coronavirus-social-distancing-guidelines-april-30-1887622,The Daily Star,Trump extends coronavirus social distancing guidelines to April 30,"Bracing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 people, US President Donald Trump on Sunday extended restrictive social distancing guidelines through April, bowing to public-health experts who presented him with even more dire projections for the expanding coronavirus pandemic.It was a stark shift in tone by the president, who only days ago mused about the country reopening in a few weeks. From the Rose Garden, he said his Easter revival hopes had only been ""aspirational.""
The initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government expires Monday and Trump had expressed interest in relaxing the national guidelines at least in parts of the country less afflicted by the pandemic. He instead decided to extend them through April 30, a tacit acknowledgment he'd been too optimistic. Many states and local governments have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings.Trump's impulse to reopen the country met a sober reality check Sunday from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, who said the US could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic. That warning hardened a recognition in Washington that the struggle against the coronavirus will not be resolved quickly even as Trump expressed a longing for normalcy.""I want our life back again,"" the president told reporters.Trump, who has largely avoided talk of potential death and infection rates, cited projection models that said potentially 2.2 million people or more could have died had social distancing measures not been put in place. And he said the country would be doing well if it ''can hold'' the number of deaths ""down to 100,000.'' He said the best case for the country would be for the death rate to peak in about two weeks.''It's a horrible number,'' Trump said, but added, ""We all together have done a very good job.""Brought forward by Trump at the outdoor briefing, Fauci said his projection of a potential 100,000 to 200,000 deaths is ""entirely conceivable'' if not enough is done to mitigate the crisis. He said that helped shape the extension of the guidelines, which he called ""a wise and prudent decision.""Americans are now being called on to prepare for another 30 days of severe economic and social disruption, as schools and businesses are closed and public life is upended. One in 3 Americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus.
Trump acknowledged that he may be forced to extend the guidelines again at the end of April, but expressed hope that by June 1, ''we should be well on our way to recovery.""The federal guidelines recommend against group gatherings larger than 10 and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay home. People are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants, bars, non-essential travel and shopping trips.For more than a week, Trump had been bombarded by calls from outside business leaders who urged him to begin re-opening the nation's economy and warned of catastrophic consequences that could damage his re-election chances if it remained shuttered for much longer.""The president is right. The cure can't be worse than the disease, and we're going to have to make some difficult trade-offs,'' Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow had said last Monday, reflecting the thinking of his economic team.That talk alarmed health experts, who urged Trump to keep encouraging people to stay home. The virus was still spreading, with the peak still weeks away, the experts warned.In the end, Trump, in the face of dire projections and increasingly alarming images out of New York, sided with his health experts and backed off the idea of loosening recommended restrictions on less impacted parts of the country.''They're the best in the profession and they didn't like that idea,"" he said of Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, head of the White House coronavirus task force.Trump was clearly moved by the scenes from New York, particularly hard-hit Elmhurst Hospital in his native Queens.""I've been watching that for the last week on television,'' he said.""Body bags all over, in hallways. I've been watching them bring in trailer trucks — freezer trucks, they're freezer trucks, because they can't handle the bodies, there are so many of them. This is essentially in my community, in Queens, Queens, New York,'' he continued. ""I've seen things that I've never seen before.""Phasing out the recommendations would have been a symbolic nod to business and an affront to public health experts, but may have had little practical impact. States across the country already have their own restrictions in place that, in many cases, are far stricter than the administration's, and those would have remained in place.Birx and Fauci said even those areas yet to face a significant outbreak must prepare for the eventuality that they will.""This can happen anywhere,'' Fauci said. ''And that's really one of the issues that we're concerned about and why we were so reluctant to pull back at a time when we need to put our foot on the gas as opposed to on the brake.""The US had more than 139,000 COVID-19 cases reported by Sunday evening, with more than 2,400 deaths. During the course of the Rose Garden briefing, reported deaths grew by several dozen and the number of cases by several thousand.
Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies.Fauci's prediction would take the death toll well past that of the average seasonal flu. Trump repeatedly cited the flu's comparatively much higher cost in lives in playing down the severity of this pandemic.Trump's change in tone was previewed Saturday, when the president suggested then backed away from instituting an ""enforceable"" quarantine of hard-hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. Instead, the White House task force recommended a travel advisory for residents of those states to limit non-essential travel to slow the spread of the virus to other parts of the USThe quarantine notion was strongly opposed by the governors of those states, who argued it would cause panic.Even as he opted against the quarantine, Trump on Sunday suggested without evidence that hospitals and hospital systems were ""hoarding"" ventilators and other medical supplies that were needed in other areas of the state. He also encouraged the Food and Drug Administration to streamline approvals for companies seeking to sanitize badly needed respirators so they can be reused.For weeks, Trump minimized the gravity of the pandemic, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday accused Trump of ""denial"" in the crisis and called it ""deadly.''Asked whether she believes that attitude cost American lives, Pelosi told CNN: ""Yes, I am. I'm saying that.''Former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, said he wouldn't go so far as to lay the blame for deaths on the president. ""I think that's a little too harsh,'' he told NBC."

This will ensure smooth supply of the safety gear.""Shamim suggested that coronavirus testing facilities be decentralised and scaled up among private hospitals.""If private hospitals can perform coronavirus tests, people's hassles will reduce. The hospitals will collect the kits from the government.Shamim said there were around 400 hospitals across the country with over 50 beds.
""The government should give them a monetary incentive for smooth operation over the next three months. Private hospitals will surely return the money in instalments.""Randomly setting up hospitals may not be the solution, he said.""Currently, there are around 1.5 lakh beds in private hospitals. The government could uitilise these facilities.""Labaid has 300 beds, he said, adding, ""If government asks, we can dedicate 150 for coronavirus patients. We have the establishment, trained personnel and other equipment. This would be a more feasible approach.""Referring to reports of people not getting treatment at different hospitals, Shamim said the problem would be solved if hospitals are dedicated for coronavirus patients only.

TIP OF ICEBERG
India has registered 1,071 cases of the coronavirus, of whom 29 have died, the health ministry said on Monday. The number of known cases is small compared with the United States, Italy and China, but health officials say India is weeks away from a huge surge that could overwhelm its weak public health system.
A health official said the large scale movement of people into the countryside risked spreading the coronavirus widely, compounding the challenge of containing the outbreak in the world's second most populous country.""It's an evolving situation with daily new challenges coming up, like having migratory populations moving from one place to another. Like non-affected states adjoining affected states,"" said Dr S.K. Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, which investigates and recommends control measures for outbreaks of illness.In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, health workers dressed in protection suits sprayed disinfectant on a group of migrant workers who were also trying to make the journey home to their villages, local television showed. They were made to sit on a street corner in the Bareilly district and doused with hose pipes, prompting anger on social media.Nitish Kumar, the top government official in the district, later said health workers had been ordered to disinfect buses being used by the local authorities but in their zeal they had also turned their hoses onto migrant workers.""I have asked for action to be taken against those responsible for this,"" he said in a tweet.The federal government said on Monday that it had no plans to extend the shutdown beyond the three-week period.But neighbouring Nepal announced it would prolong its shutdown for another week from Tuesday. The landlocked country has reported only five cases of the virus and no deaths, but it is concerned contagion will spread as more people travel."

"1 Apr,2020",https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/coronavirus-outbreak-low-test-rate-may-be-belying-reality-1888327,The Daily Star,"
Coronavirus Outbreak: Low test rate may be belying reality","""We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.""These were the words Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said at a press briefing in Geneva in mid-March while expressing concern over the actions some nations have taken on detecting and containing the novel coronavirus.With 51 reported infections and five deaths so far, is Bangladesh conducting enough tests?The available data gives a grim picture. The country tested 1,602 people from late January until yesterday, which hardly gives a clear idea about the real situation in the entire country. And the reason is limited testing.Until now, Bangladesh has a restrictive testing policy -- it tests only those with recent travel history to affected countries or those known to have come into contact with confirmed cases and have Covid-19 symptoms. And Bangladesh is now among the countries with very low testing rates.Three weeks elapsed since the country recorded its first coronavirus case on March 8, but the authorities are still struggling to get ahandle on the extent of the spread of the virus.The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) maintains that there has been community transmission on a limited scale.Experts, however, fear the number of infected people could be higher as many carriers of the virus could be off the radar due to limited testing.They said widespread testing makes a big difference because, in many cases, coronavirus patients can be asymptomatic. Unless those are detected, the risk of virus transmission will be high.Till last week, the IEDCR was the sole Covid-19 testing authority in the country. Only a couple of days ago, six other organisations -- five in the capital and one in Chattogram -- got the government nod to conduct tests.People with coronavirus-like symptoms found it difficult to get tested after making phone calls on the hotlines provided by the IEDCR and Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).The IEDCR and the DGHS received more than 70,000 coronavirus-related phone calls in 24 hours till 3:00pm yesterday. Of those, only 140 suspected cases were tested and two fresh cases were detected.A lack of sample collectors is one of the major reasons behind limited testing. The institute has only 20 staffers who collect samples in the capital, said sources.Just a couple of days ago, medical technologists of 130 healthcare organisations completed training, arranged by the government, for collecting samples from suspected Covid-19 patients.
A shortage of test kits, on the other hand, initially hindered the government's response to the crisis. Like other countries, Bangladesh too had difficulties in getting the kits from abroad because of flight restrictions imposed by several countries.At a press briefing yesterday, Habibur Rahman, director of Management Information System of the DGHS, said they collected 92,000 kits for Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, and of those, 21,000 were already sent to different laboratories.The country is now scaling up its testing capacity. It is now readying seven organisations in the capital and three outside for conducting tests.""We have already increased the testing capacity within a short period of time,"" said Habibur.He mentioned that they plan to increase by April 20 the number of Covid-19 testing organisations to 28.By April 5, three labs will be ready in the capital and another five in other parts of the country for conducting Covid-19 tests. By April 20, four more labs will be prepared in the capital and six outside, said Habibur.The Daily Star yesterday learnt that the labs in Mymensingh and Rangpur were yet to start conducting tests.
Experts say the government should have expanded the testing facilities much before, preferably by February, when it became clear that the epidemic was spreading across the globe.Bangladesh cannot afford to lose any more time as it has already spent three months on preparations for dealing with the crisis, they point out.
They say the US and Spain, which did not put emphasis on widespread testing, are now seeing an explosion of cases.On the other hand, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, which have so far managed to contain the spread of the virus, have been able to do so by testing more and more suspected cases, they mention.
""As of now, the number of tests appears to be very limited,"" Prof Nazrul Islam, a virologist and former vice chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, told The Daily Star.""Unless we go for widespread testing, we will not be able to get a clear picture of the real situation,"" he said, adding that it is difficult to say anything about the level of community transmission as no scientific data is available.""We have to wait till April 5. By that time, two incubation periods [since the first reported case] will be over, and it will be possible to come up with an estimation [of the number of infections].""He pointed out that sudden deaths of people with coronavirus-like symptoms is another matter of concern.""Each and every one of these cases should be analysed,"" he noted.Speaking on the issue at a briefing yesterday, IEDCR Director Prof Meerjady Sabrina Flora said they did not find any coronavirus infections in the samples that they had collected from the people who died after showing virus-like symptoms.She, however, did not mention how many samples the IEDCR had collected.COORDINATORS FOR 8 DIVISIONSThe DGHS has assigned eight experts to coordinate Covid-19 prevention and control activities in the eight divisions.They will also oversee the activities of the medical technologists under the DGHS, who will collect samples from suspected cases in each upazila. The samples will then be sent to divisionallaboratories, sources said.""If we can test at least 1,000 samples in each lab a day, the total number of tests would be 8,000,"" said Prof Dr Shah Monir Hossain, coordinator of Dhaka Division.He hoped the number of tests will go up next week.Asked whether the existing workforce is capable of doing the task, Prof Monir, also former director general of the DGHS, said that if any problem arises, the staffers concerned would be given training or be replaced."

""Trade and Tariff Commission has sent a proposal to ensure that no small and medium industry shuts down for a lack of working capital, and no jobs are lost due to coronavirus-related economic problems, and Finance Ministry is working on it,"" Tapan Kanti Ghosh, chairman of Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission, told The Daily Star yesterday.The SMEs are now facing a big crisis with economists and bankers urging the government to protect the businesses for the sake of the country's economic growth.The country has 78.18 lakh SMEs that employ 2.45 crore people, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.The majority of the SMEs are cottage-based, which account for 40 percent of the total employed population of 6.08 crore.As a whole, the SMEs contribution to Bangladesh's GDP is 20.25 percent, according to a study conducted by the International Cooperation Organisation for Small and Medium Enterprises in Asia (ICOSA), Japan.An assistance of sorts was offered to them on March 19, when Bangladesh Bank asked banks not to consider borrowers as defaulters if they fail to repay instalments until June 30 this year. But their accounts will continue to accrue interest during the period.Tapan said there is a plan to form a separate fund similar to the Export Development Fund, managed by the central bank, to support SMEs.
In addition, export-oriented industries will also be given support so that they can recoup losses amid the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic that have so far claimed more than 42,000 lives globally.The government will provide the support in addition to its previously announced Tk 5,000 crore fund for export-oriented factories for paying wages of workers.
At a high-level meeting presided over by Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi yesterday, top officials discussed ways of keeping the supply chain of essentials uninterrupted to prevent mismatch between supply and demand as well as price fluctuations between production zones and urban areas.They also had a discussion on the risk of shortage of commodities in the market owing to a lack of transport as many truckers are staying off the road for fear of coronavirus and a lack of security, said meeting sources.At the meeting, a decision was taken to alert the law enforcement agencies to ensure seamless movement of goods throughout the country and curb scope of extortion.Besides, intelligence agencies would be asked to be vigilant to prevent hoarding of goods by unscrupulous traders or businesses, they said.The meeting was attended by Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam, Army Chief General Aziz Ahmed, Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Mohammad Rahmatul Munim, Finance Secretary Abdur Rouf Talukder, Commerce Secretary Jafar Uddin, Bangladesh Bank Governor Fazle Kabir and leaders of the business community.Later, Tipu told this newspaper that if any garment factory has work orders from international retailers or global brands, it can continue operation by ensuring adequate health safety measures for its workers.About the meeting, he said it was a coordination meeting between government high-ups, the army chief and business leaders for assessing the current situation.The minister said there is confusion about operation of garment factories as the government announced holidays from March 26 to April 11.
Some factory owners are keeping their production units open while some others are keeping their units shut because of confusion, he mentioned.""There is no confusion. If any factory has work orders from international retailers or brands, it can run its operation,"" Tipu said.In separate statements last Friday, the Department of Inspection for Factory and Establishment, and Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said factories can be kept open with adequate safety measures for workers.The minister yesterday said some businesspeople want to export Personal Protective Equipment as they have been producing a lot of those recently. The ministry will decide on this later.The exporters demanded an extension of the repayment period for the Tk 5,000 crore stimulus package. The government gave them 24 months, including six-month grace period, for paying back the money.""We heard them. We will discuss all the issues soon and reach a decision,"" Tipu told this newspaper over the phone after the meeting.He urged house owners to reduce rents for workers at this time of crisis.The minister further said the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh has started selling some essentials, including edible oil, lentil and sugar, at low prices across the country.There is no possibility of a sudden price hike of these goods in the upcoming Ramadan as the country has an adequate stock of basic commodities, he added."
"2 Apr,2020",https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/tennis/news/wimbledon-cancelled-due-coronavirus-pandemic-1888561,The Daily Star,Wimbledon cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic,"Wimbledon tennis championships were cancelled for the first time since World War Two as the coronavirus pandemic wiped another blue-riband sports event off the calendar on Wednesday.While the decision had looked inevitable for some time, since the virtual shutdown of world sport and the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, Wimbledon had been one of the few events not to have been officially cancelled or postponed.But after emergency talks between the various stakeholders over the last few days, the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) announced that it was impossible for the grasscourt Grand Slam, scheduled for June 29-July 12, to take place.""It is with great regret that the main board of the All England Club and the committee of management of the championships have today decided that The Championships 2020 will be cancelled due to public health concerns linked to the coronavirus epidemic,"" the AELTC said in a statement https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2020-04-01/cancellation_of....""The 134th Championships will instead be staged from June 28 to July 11, 2021.The men's ATP Tour and women's WTA Tour are already suspended until at least June 7 but it looks extremely unlikely that any professional tennis will be possible throughout the summer as the pandemic worsens in Europe and the U.S.Britain's death toll from the virus reached 2,352 on Wednesday, according to NHS figures.
The French Open, originally due to be held from May 24-June 7 has been postponed and controversially rescheduled by the French tennis federation for Sept. 20-Oct. 4, shortly after the end of the U.S. Open.Former Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo doubts whether either tournament will be played though.""I think we're going to have to draw a line under the 2020 tennis season,"" Mauresmo said on Twitter this week.""International circuit = players of all nationalities plus management, spectators and people from the 4 corners of the world who bring these events to life. No vaccine = no tennis.""Unlike the French Open which is played on clay, Wimbledon's scope for re-arranging the start date was extremely limited.
While Centre Court and Court One boast a roof, playing elite level tennis outside on grass would have been extremely challenging in late summer or autumn with a lack of light and problems caused by dew forming on the surface late in the day.Shortening the format of the tournament, or playing behind closed doors, would also have proved extremely unpopular with the players.Wimbledon has been held every year since 1946 after a six-year hiatus because the country was at war."
"1 Apr,2020",https://www.thedailystar.net/coronavirus-brazil-president-facebook-instagram-post-deleted-over-fake-news-1888402,The Daily Star,Coronavirus: Brazil president’s post deleted over fake news,"Facebook and Instagram removed videos of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Monday, saying they spread misinformation about the coronavirus, a day after Twitter did the same.""We remove content on Facebook and Instagram that violates our terms of use, which do not allow misinformation that could cause physical harm to individuals,"" Facebook said in a statement in Portuguese.Twitter on Sunday explained it had removed the videos in accordance with its recently expanded global rules on managing content that contradicted public health information from official sources, and could put people at greater risk of transmitting COVID-19.The videos showed the far-right leader flouting his government's social distancing guidelines by mixing with supporters on the streets of Brasilia on Sunday and urging them to keep the economy going.
On Monday, Mandetta again stressed the importance of social distancing in order to slow the virus.""At this time, we must maintain the highest degree of social distancing, so that we can... give time for the (health) system to strengthen itself,"" he said.Bolsonaro has repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus, describing it as ""a flu"" and calling for schools and shops to re-open, with self-isolation necessary only for people over the age of 60.On Monday, his leading opponents urged him to resign in a joint letter, arguing that he committed a crime with his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.""Bolsonaro is more than just a political problem, he has become a public-health problem... He should resign,"" said the statement, which was signed by a dozen leading left-wing figures.On Saturday, Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta highlighted the importance of containment as a means of fighting the coronavirus. Brazil has reported the most coronavirus cases in Latin America so far: 4,256, with 136 deaths."
"2 Apr,2020",https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/big-data-the-coronavirus-battle-plan-1888573,The Daily Star,Big data in the coronavirus battle plan,"Coronavirus (the virus causing the disease Covid-19) has two universal problems: no vaccine or drug has been developed as yet, and the diagnostic tools are scarce. This combination has dangerously multiplied the risk of infecting Bangladesh. Because, our population density is much higher than those countries that have been fatally hit by far (see the graph).
Our healthcare system reasonably functions up to the grassroots level. It is, however, historically incapacitated to fight any pandemic. Not the headcount of doctors and nurses, but standard procedure to contain a pandemic is the missing link. This is more of a structural, rather than a financial or technical, problem. Yet everyone is giving their best shot. The question is: for how long?We have missed the bus.Bangladesh government has rightly allowed the en masse homecoming of expatriate citizens, especially the ones from Italy. But a series of missteps has eclipsed the government's humane gesture. Screening after disembarkation and tagging a local mobile phone number with each passenger's passport details at the immigration desk before temporally caging the suspected cases in the notoriously mismanaged quarantine facilities have left them untraceable. Authorities are now clueless about the illness and wellness of the suspected returnees, who have been diluted into the ocean of nationwide rural population.These living souls are the second only pillar, after garments, of our foreign currency reserve. And they, certainly, never get any subsidy. A free mobile connection to each of them at immigration would not cost the exchequer an arm and a leg. In return, the government could easily track their location and movement by using the inputs from mobile operators. Thailand has strictly applied this simple method for incoming tourists. And multiple agencies with diverse portfolio are coordinating it. Unity in diversity within the administration is a government's strength for crisis management. It is missing in Bangladesh.What we should doNow the government has decided to apply big data analytics using mobile phone users' information to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The government has initiated a process to draw a digital map to track coronavirus cases and find out areas susceptible to contamination by using mobile users' information—a move that may help portray the real picture of a possible outbreak. The operators will share the data with a national monitoring centre and the Access to Information (a2i) project under the ICT Division every six hours, and the two will then develop the map,"" according to a report by The Daily Star on March 29. There are points to ponder.
The National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre (NTMC), an agency under the home ministry, is the only legal entity to analyse mobile user's data. The workforce of NTMC is composed of individuals from all security outfits. Ironically, it lacks functional coordination with those organisations from where its personnel come. It is largely reminiscent of the pre-9/11 America where intelligence agencies happily lived within respective walled gardens. The consequence was disastrous and interagency coordination is now central to the US national security blueprint.
Resource-constrained Bangladesh cannot afford to repeat the resourceful America's mistake. The archipelago of extrapolating mobile users' data should be exclusive to NTMC while other security agencies will have unfettered access to it. The non-security outfits like health, transport, local government, social welfare, etc. will receive customised data according to respective need. But the big data processing of more than 166 million mobile connections should be off-limits for individuals or entities lacking required security clearance. This is the reality in the context of Bangladesh.

Last words
Four years ago, Bill Gates warned about Covid-19 without naming it. The global leaders chose to ignore him. Now the Dutch King, Austrian Chancellor and ""countless ministers from all kinds of countries"" are frantically calling a leading German ventilator manufacturer. The Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg had already shouted at all of them six months ago. The politicians predictably remain unashamed.

Covid-19 is not the last pandemic virus. And nobody knows when the next one will attack, followed by another. Therefore, big data analytics using live mobile phone connections must not be a one-off affair in Bangladesh. It should be captured in our national security policy with paramount importance. That's why, the mobile big data should be processed only by the individuals having required security clearance. Competent data scientists with global experience reside in Bangladesh. Finding and engaging them is up to the government's political goodwill.
