"February 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/in-epidemics-like-china-s-virus-outbreak-most-economic-damage-stems-from-fear/567439302/,StarTribune,"In epidemics like China's virus outbreak, most economic damage stems from fear","The Yu Garden, a 16th-century complex of pavilions and ponds in the heart of Shanghai, was all gussied up for the Chinese New Year holiday. Its walkways were bedecked with colorful lanterns, its stalls laden with dumplings, its entrances flanked by dozens of security guards to handle crowds.
Just one thing is missing: people. Fearful of coronavirus, they stayed home.
“I’ll be doing well if I make a few sales today,” says Li Xinming, manager of a silk-scarf shop. Last year Yu Garden attracted 700,000 visitors during the holiday week, peak season for it and its merchants. This year, Li said his losses might wipe out his earnings for months to come.
The question for China, and for the many companies and countries around the world linked to its economy, is whether Li’s travails are indicative of a much broader problem.
The obvious reference point is China’s battle with SARS, another coronavirus, in 2003. Growth slowed sharply at the height of the epidemic but rebounded swiftly after it was contained. Other recent epidemics have reinforced the impression that economists should not be overly worried, so long as good doctors are on the job. Neither avian flu in 2006 nor swine flu in 2009 dimmed the global outlook.
Yet even flint-hearted investors are wondering whether the new epidemic might be worse. Stocks in Hong Kong have fallen by nearly 10% as reported infections have steadily increased. Tremors have also rippled through global markets.
The concern is less the severity of the virus, which seems less lethal than SARS, but rather the nature and potential duration of China’s efforts to bring the outbreak under control. And disruption in China, the world’s second-biggest economy, has global consequences. “It’s not the disease, it’s the treatment,” wrote analysts with Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy.
The World Bank has estimated that as much as 90% of the economic damage from epidemics stems from people’s fear of associating with others, which leads offices and stores to close. In China, this is being magnified by the government’s policy of isolating affected areas and limiting interpersonal contact throughout the country. While public-health experts debate whether this is the right approach, economists will count the costs.
The most direct effect is being felt in Hubei province. First Wuhan, its capital, was placed under quarantine. Then the rest of the province, home to nearly 60 million people, was locked down, too. Apart from food trucks and medical supplies, little can enter its cities and villages, and few are permitted to leave. Such a large-scale isolation is unprecedented as a public-health strategy. Economic activity of just about any kind, short of hospital care and movie streaming, has ground to a halt. Hubei generates 4.5% of China’s GDP, so the closure will leave a hole.
Other cities in China may not be under quarantine but that is what life feels like for their residents. Instead of getting together with family and friends, attending temple fairs and going to restaurants — all, depending on where one lives, staples of the holiday — people have shut themselves in. The government has encouraged them to avoid crowds; many need little prodding.
That will be a drag on consumption. The extent of the damage will depend on how long it takes to stop the virus, but the timing is already rotten. Last year retail sales exceeded 1 trillion ($144 billion) yuan during the new-year week, a third more than an average week. This year, sales are sure to fall well short of that.
Some industries are being hit especially hard. The holiday accounted for 9% of China’s box-office revenue last year. This year almost all of the country’s 11,000 cinemas are closed. Spending on domestic tourism during the new-year week reached more than 500 billion yuan last year, about 8% of the annual total. This year, fearful of the virus, people have canceled trips.
There are also worries about how the virus will affect factories and offices. Several major economic centers, including Shanghai and Guangdong province, have extended the New Year holiday by a week, telling companies to wait until Feb. 10 to restart. Chinese businesses are always slow to get back up to speed after the holiday.
The extra week will make them slower, even if some firms such as Tencent, a tech giant, let employees work from home. Moreover, tens of millions of migrant workers, back in their hometowns for the holiday, may wait for the epidemic to recede before crowding onto trains and buses to return to their jobs.
One critical difference compared with SARS is China’s importance for the rest of the world. In 2003, China generated 4% of global GDP. Last year, it was 16%.
The slowdown in consumption and the disruption to production will not stop at its borders."
"February 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/even-after-trade-war-detente-prices-for-u-s-crops-didn-t-get-a-lift/567442682/,StarTribune,"Even after trade-war detente, prices for U.S. crops didn't get a lift","President Donald Trump touted the trade cease-fire he signed with China last month as a “momentous step,” but it didn’t lift commodity prices.
U.S. pork and soybeans, the two farm goods most likely to benefit from China’s commitment to purchase $32 billion in farm products over the next two years, are both down over the past two weeks. Corn prices, which don’t have as direct 
The spread of corona­virus that originated in the Chinese megacity of Wuhan has roiled markets worldwide, suppressing the upside from the trade peace. Even before that surprise damper on prices, there was skepticism that China will follow through on its end of the deal and concern that continued tariffs on U.S. exports to China will prolong farmers’ struggles.
Meanwhile, a global oversupply of grain persists and is likely to grow in coming weeks with signs pointing to a good crop in Brazil, the No. 2 food producer in the Western Hemisphere and already a larger exporter of soybeans to China than the U.S.
“China hasn’t been doing anything. Wheat was down last week because China was buying wheat from three or four countries but not the U.S.,” said Mark Mason, a broker at Kluis Commodity Advisors in Wayzata. “They’re supposed to start making purchases in 30 days, and the worry is, can they do that when they’re focused on the coronavirus.”
The pork market, which spiked in May but since fell back below pre-trade war levels, will just have to see more convincing evidence of Chinese demand before prices rise, said David Preis­ler, executive director of the Minnesota Pork Producers. A market-weight hog was fetching roughly $130 on Friday — about $35 less than it was before the trade war started.
“Until it’s on the ship and cleared customs in China, it’s probably not going to affect the marketplace,” Preisler said. “We need to physically see that we’re increasing exports. That, in turn, should have an effect on price.”
Soybean growers in Minnesota, many of whom have been growing their crop specifically for export to China, were hit especially hard by the trade war and received the biggest checks from the government to help them weather the tariffs. On the surface, China’s commitment to double U.S. farm imports should have lifted prices. Instead, soybeans are down 54 cents since the trade deal was signed, to $8.75 per bushel.
Prices for soybeans have been affected by China’s 2019 outbreak of swine fever — which killed as many as half of that nation’s pigs — at least as much as by the trade war, said Preston Caldwell, a Morningstar equity analyst who specializes in Chinese economics. The fatal hog illness has also spread to Vietnam and several other East Asian countries.
“I wouldn’t expect the unwinding of the trade war to have a major impact” on prices, Caldwell said.
Morningstar’s ag experts also don’t believe China will meet its quotas for U.S. imports.
“Even if the targets were met, it would represent less than a 10% gross boost to total U.S. agricultural exports of about $150 billion,” Caldwell said. “The net boost would very likely be an order of magnitude smaller, as higher exports to China will largely represent a redirection of exports that would’ve gone to other countries.”
Perhaps the biggest problem for farmers, one that won’t go away soon, is an oversupply of grain — and competition from farmers in other parts of the world.
Despite a poor growing year for U.S. farmers in 2019, Brazil’s crop is looking excellent, said Rick Erickson, risk manager for Goodhue-based Ag Partners, which operates several grain elevators in southeast Minnesota and southwest Wisconsin.
“There’s many factors at work, but the No. 1 thing is we have ample supplies of commodities in the world — corn and soybeans,” Erickson said.
South American farmers aren’t as choosy as North American farmers about when they sell their grain — and at what price, he said. They’ll price the grain at whatever level will move it quickly, while U.S. farmers store their grain and wait for a better price.
Erickson said it’s not all gloomy, however.
“Some of the prices are higher than they were a year ago,” Erickson said. “They’re just not as high as we’d like.”
A final factor limiting the effects of the trade deal on prices is that China did not promise to lift its tariffs — which will be a long-term drag on pork, soybeans and other U.S. commodities.
“Without the tariffs coming off,” said Preisler, “it still puts us at a competitive disadvantage.”"
"February 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-st-paul-airport-s-quarantine-station-is-on-guard/567449602/,StarTribune,Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport's quarantine station is on guard,"Screening for travelers infected with a novel coronavirus might be job No. 1 right now for the quarantine station at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, but the facility has been operating for more than a decade to prevent serious infectious diseases from emerging in the U.S.
Opened following the global SARS outbreak in 2003, the station is responsible for detecting people coming to the U.S. at local entry points with serious or suspicious illnesses, and has the authority to quarantine anyone with an infection that has been deemed a serious threat by federal executive order. Examples include smallpox, the SARS virus, and any new influenza virus that poses a threat of a global pandemic.
Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined requests for interviews with leaders of the local quarantine station, but Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said all 20 stations in the U.S. work daily with Customs and Border Protection officials to identify ill travelers.
“It’s called our standard illness protocol, part of our normal business,” she said, “but we’re enhancing those activities” by adding staff at all 20 given the coronavirus concern.
CDC quarantine stations were reduced from 55 to eight in the 1970s, a period of relative calm with regard to global pandemics, but were added back at the Minneapolis airport and other locations. The Minneapolis station also is responsible for responding to cases of seriously ill people entering the U.S. through ships at the Duluth water port, and U.S.-Canada border crossings in Minnesota and North Dakota.
In terms of their ability to seal off the nation from viral threats, the stations are limited, said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. “These detection stations that are set up at airports to pick up people who come in with fevers are kind of like fixing three of the five screen doors in your submarine.”
The stations do play a key role in educating travelers, though, Osterholm said. Returnees from China might not have symptoms until after they are back home and need to know what to do.
Messonnier said education is one reason why staffing is being increased at all quarantine stations, including at the MSP airport. Travelers returning from China will be checked for fevers and handed cards that instruct them to call doctors if they get sick rather than go to clinics, where they could spread an infection to others.
Researchers have differed on whether the new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, is more infectious than seasonal influenza, though they agree that it doesn’t spread as quickly as the measles.
The severity of infection is unclear as well, though people who are elderly or have other health problems appear at greater risk of complications."
"February 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/amid-colorful-celebration-at-mall-of-america-some-worry-about-coronavirus-spreading-in-china/567496832/,StarTribune,"Amid colorful celebration at Mall of America, some worry about coronavirus spreading in China","The bright colors, traditional music and swirling dancers at this year’s Chinese New Year celebration at the Mall of America in Bloomington were as exuberant and joyful as usual Saturday. But amid the festivities, there was also worry about the growing medical emergency in China, where a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly 12,000 people and killed at least 259.
“Oh my God, every day — of course, of course I’m worried,” said a woman who said she moved here from China 20 years ago.
Although one observer thought the crowd for the Year of the Rat celebration looked slightly smaller than last year’s turnout, and at least one person wore a face mask, news of the virus did not appear to have kept people away from the event. Hundreds gathered or paused in the mall’s rotunda to watch performers of all ages — singers, musicians and dance troupes, most in vivid traditional attire — take the stage.
“In Minnesota, we don’t scare, we just come out,” said Louis Lau, a mall employee who spoke briefly to the audience. “I think Minnesota people are always strong.”
But with 55 million people in China’s Hubei Province under an unprecedented lockdown and the virus now spreading to more than 20 other countries, some people’s thoughts were on family members in China and neighboring countries.
“Yeah, we’re worried,” said Henry Yoon, an associate professor of biopsychology at Augsburg University in Minneapolis who has relatives in South Korea. “I’ve been talking about it with a lot of people. ... We’re all trying to put a bright face on it, but we all know there’s this looming ominous threat moving around us.”
The Chinese New Year is traditionally a time to travel, as tens of millions of people working in Chinese cities make visits to their home villages, forming the largest human migration on Earth. So the rapid expansion of the dreaded virus “is almost catastrophic to a lot of families in China,” Yoon said.
A University of Minnesota student who hopes to find a job in China after he receives his master’s degree this year said he’s concerned that the Chinese government may be understating the size of the outbreak. The student, who asked that his name not be used, also has heard that not all of the masks that Chinese people wear when they leave home are of hospital-grade quality.
Feng Wang of Medina said her friends returning here after traveling in China have been staying home for 14 days, the virus’ incubation period. Her relatives in China are wearing masks, avoiding crowds and taking other precautions. “We’re being cautious,” she said.
Still, many people with Chinese connections have remained relatively calm. Tian Li, a University of Minnesota architecture student, said he talks to his family in China almost every day via WeChat, a Chinese phone app that allows videotelephone communication.
His family lives far from the epicenter of the outbreak. They’ve been staying home more than usual, he said, partly because of the virus, but also because it’s winter and cold outside.
“I’m not really scared,” Li said. He called up a meme on his phone with a picture of a masked Chinese man and a caption he translated as, “Come out, let’s get some fun.”
With that, Li left to prepare a short introduction to a dance troupe he would be presenting onstage, in Chinese, later that afternoon.
The Chinese New Year celebration continues at the mall Sunday from noon to 5 p.m."

Shares of casino operator Wynn Resorts, which has heavy exposure to China, sank 6.9% to $125.45 Monday as the rapid spread of the deadly coronavirus out of Wuhan, China, has led to travel bans. Shares closed the week at $126.16.
Virus winner
Cleveland BioLabs shares more than doubled Monday to $2.98 as it benefited from a market move to stocks that could benefit from the coronavirus outbreak. The company makes a vaccine adjuvant that bolsters immune response. Shares closed Friday at $4.23.

"February 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/factories-in-minnesota-across-nation-rebound-from-slumps/567523182/,StarTribune,"Factories in Minnesota, across nation rebound from slumps","With much-needed boosts to sales and new orders, Minnesota and Midwest manufacturers said they returned to solid expansion in January. And Minnesota showed jobs growth, a welcome sign in a tight economy.
It was the second month in a row that manufacturing conditions improved in nine Midwestern states surveyed by Creighton University in its Mid-America Business Conditions Index.
Manufacturing nationwide also rebounded, with factories reporting to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) that on average they returned to growth. In December, the national index was 47.8; in January, it rose to 50.9. Anything above 50 signals expansion. Nationwide, only eight of 18 manufacturing sectors grew last month.
Creighton’s Mid-America index showed brisker growth, with its index in January leaping to 57.2 from 50.6 in December. The index was at its highest point in almost a year.
Minnesota’s index also was 57.9, up from 50.7 in December, Creighton reported. Supply managers in the state reported growth in sales, new orders, inventories and job growth.
Creighton economists noted that the state’s factories enjoyed a 4.5% wage increase and hiring among food producers and other makers of “nondurable” goods. On the flip side, however, “durable goods manufacturers in the state are shedding jobs,” said Ernie Goss, director of Creighton’s Economic Forecasting Group.
The survey findings landed Monday, just after several multinational companies such as 3M, Polaris and Graco recently reported fourth-quarter results that were mixed, signaling domestic-sales increases but in several cases the continued slowdown of business from China, Asia and sectors such as auto, aerospace and industrial.
Creighton’s January surveys were conducted before the coronavirus outbreak in China fully hit and therefore do not include effects from what has developed into a growing international health crisis, university officials said.
The Creighton report — which tracks factory conditions across Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Arkansas and Oklahoma — did see an unexpected uptick in employment in January, following months of complaints that trade tariffs and the inability to find and hire workers was severely hampering job growth.
“January’s positive employment reading was a positive and unexpected outcome,” said Goss. “The weakness in the region’s manufacturing and agriculture sector [had] spilled over into the broader regional economy. Over the past 12 months, the Mid-America region has added jobs at [only] a 0.6% pace. [That’s] less than half the 1.4% rate of the U.S. economy.”
The folks at MRG Tool and Die in Faribault said they can relate. The company fabricates metal parts for robotics-equipment firms and manufacturers of aircraft, food, transportation and consumer products.
The company, with 73 employees, has been able to add some new hires but it’s tough. “There are not a lot of individuals out there when I am looking for skilled machinists,” said MRG President Rod Gramse during a phone interview. “If I am looking for individuals who have a tool-and-die tooling background, there are not as many of them.”
That has hindered growth, Gramse said. Yes, the company is growing at 3% to 5% a year but it doesn’t have enough workers with the skills needed to operate all its high-tech machines, he said.
Still, he was happy to see sales grow across the board. “We had some decent activity in January,” Gramse said Monday, noting that his month benefited by catching up on back orders.
Creighton reported that other positives for the region included increases in inventories and export orders, even as imports sank dramatically during January.
Supply managers reported enhanced confidence levels for the month that were aided by January’s passage of the new trade agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada (USMCA), as well as the signing of the Phase One trade agreement with China.
Nearly a third of all factory managers Creighton surveyed reported that shifting U.S. trade policies and the resulting trade war caused them to change international vendors and disrupt traditional supply chains.
While it is too soon to see actual sales results from the new trade agreements, factory heads reported feeling more confident the future. “Approximately 56% of supply managers expect USMCA and Phase One Chinese agreement to have a positive impact on their business prospects,” Goss said."
"February 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/state-of-the-union-can-trump-compartmentalize-like-bill-clinton-did/567555612/,StarTribune,State of the Union: Can Trump compartmentalize like Clinton did?,"In 1999, in the midst of his impeachment trial, Bill Clinton delivered a typically verbose State of the Union Address that ran for 78 minutes. Although it surprised many at the time, Clinton did not display a glimmer of concern about his predicament or allude to impeachment in any way.
Even more than most presidents, Clinton had a rare talent to compartmentalize. But the 1999 State of the Union was more than just an artful performance by a political master of denial. At the end of his speech, Clinton actually unveiled a new political argument that shaped the final two years of his presidency.
In 1999, one of the biggest domestic problems facing America was (nostalgia alert) what to do with the coming budget surplus. Anticipating Republican pressure for massive tax cuts, Clinton concocted a devilishly clever response.
In his State of the Union, Clinton said about the surplus, “I say, we shouldn’t spend any of it — not any of it — until after Social Security is truly saved. First things first.”
That argument gave rise to the Democratic slogan, “Save Social Security First,” that prevented any major tax cuts until after George W. Bush was elected in 2000.
Donald Trump — in case somehow you have failed to notice — lacks the ability to compartmentalize.
Trump, in a way, lives up to the famous description of the ousted Bourbon monarchy in France: “They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.” All Trump remembers are the grudges and the hatreds while stubbornly refusing to learn from them. Or even learn that Kansas City is in Missouri.
In theory, on Tuesday night the president should turn into Teleprompter Trump as he turns the other cheek. While I do not empathize with Trump’s White House enablers and lackeys, you can just imagine their frantic efforts to convince him to be magnanimous as he delivers the State of the Union.
But Trump also knows that he is at his most boring reading off a teleprompter. And that his hard-core political base (the only people on the planet that the president even pretends to care about) craves red-meat rhetoric.
So the State of the Union invariably will become a high-wire act as legislators in the room and viewers at home wonder whether Trump will throw off the restraints that have constrained all other presidents on formal occasions like the State of the Union.
Will Trump get mad and start snarling at “Shifty Adam Schiff”? Will Trump wheel around and face Nancy Pelosi eye-to-eye and make some crack about how he won and she lost? Will Trump refer to the Salem witch trials more often than Arthur Miller did in his play “The Crucible”?
Unlike Clinton, Trump can never safely take refuge in policy proposals.
It will be hard for the president to brag about his Glorious Wall when the Washington Post reported that key portions of it will have to swing open during summer months to protect the structure against flash floods.
A normal president might use the State of the Union to reassure a jittery nation about preparations against the spread of coronavirus. But Ron Klain, who directed Barack Obama’s response to Ebola, pointed out, “The combination of Trump’s paranoia toward experienced government officials, inattention to detail, opinionated rejection of science and evidence, and isolationist instincts may prove toxic.”
Foreign policy is another tricky area for Trump. This is not exactly the ideal time for the president to brag about the success of his “bromance” with Kim Jong Un. And even an inveterate liar like Trump could not pull off claiming that America is doing everything to help Ukraine resist Vladimir Putin’s aggression.
Sure, Trump can brag about the economy and say with characteristic understatement, “The state of the union is better than at any time in human history. It is even better than Adam and Eve had it in the Garden of Eden.”
But it is hard to concoct a legislative agenda for 2020 when the only reason for the Senate to stay in session is to rubber-stamp right-wing judges and to refuse to acknowledge the existence of John Bolton.
Unless Trump veers in an unexpected direction (maybe threatening to nuke Denmark unless they hand over Greenland tomorrow), the State of the Union is likely to be a ratings disaster. Especially compared to the genuine drama of caucus night from Iowa and the historic formality of Wednesday’s impeachment verdict.
That is why the congressional Democrats should vow to avoid cheap tricks on State of the Union night. No mass walkouts, no angry shouts of “You lie” and no mocking laughter. All the Democrats need to do is to display the mild boredom of an 11-year-old receiving an etiquette lesson from Aunt Sylvia.
If the Democrats are successful in November, this will be Trump’s last State of the Union address. Especially since it is hard to picture a defeated and defanged Trump making a pilgrimage to Capitol Hill next January.
As a result, this may well be the last time for voters to draw a visual contrast between Trump and the congressional Democrats. The best way for the Democrats to win Tuesday night’s image war is to come across as the party of dignity and restraint — a party that does not make a mockery of America’s patriotic traditions.
Trump revels in any moment when he is the center of attention. But the State of the Union may be the rare exception, as Trump becomes a president who stands before the nation with absolutely nothing noteworthy to say."
"February 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/boston-scientific-warns-of-40m-hit-from-coronavirus-outbreak/567582902/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Boston Scientific warns of $40 million hit from coronavirus outbreak,"Medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp. said Wednesday that it expects to lose as much as $40 million of revenue in China in the first quarter, as the Chinese health care system focuses on stopping the spread of coronavirus cases.
Boston Scientific, which has major operations in the Twin Cities, is one of the many U.S. health care suppliers that make devices in China and sell devices for Chinese patients, and the first major med-tech company to reveal a broad potential effect from the 2019 coronavirus. The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and has infected more than 24,500 people globally, most of whom are in China.
“As our team reflects on what is going on there, it is pretty clear that the vast majority of health care resources in China are focused on diagnosing, treating and preventing the spread of coronavirus and that all other procedures are at risk of being delayed,” Chief Financial Officer Dan Brennan told Boston Scientific investors Wednesday morning.
Overall, Boston Scientific narrowly missed fourth-quarter revenue expectations, but its adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2 cents. Its shares closed at $42.62, off less than 1% for the day.
Boston Scientific sold about $500 million in devices in China last year, representing 20% growth. In the first quarter of 2020, sales are projected to decline between $10 million and $40 million compared with prior trends, but then pick up again in the second quarter, Boston Scientific executives said. In addition to cutting or delaying the number of surgeries in China requiring medical devices, the coronavirus outbreak is disrupting Boston Scientific’s manufacturing operations in China, executives said.
Asked whether Boston Scientific has already seen coronavirus-related revenue declines in January and February, Brennan was noncommittal: “Everyone sees the stuff on the news,” he said. “It’s just, the number of medical-device procedures in Q1 is not going to be what was expected 90 or 180 days ago. Certainly we are planning to see an impact in that business in Q1.”
The maker of heart devices and medical scopes, which announced a preview of some quarterly results in January, said Wednesday that it generated $2.9 billion in sales during the fourth quarter of 2019, representing organic growth of 7.3%. The company had previously said it expected at least 8% growth.
Every division showed organic-sales growth in the just-completed quarter except for the cardiac-rhythm segment, which saw a nearly 3% decline compared with the same period last year, to $473 million in sales. Cardiac-rhythm devices, like pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, monitor and regulate the heartbeat.
Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy said cardiac-rhythm devices are challenging for med-tech companies, because while the devices are widely used, they are not as profitable as they once were. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Boston Scientific increased its total share of the cardiac-rhythm device market, yet total sales of $473 million represented a nearly 3% decline compared with the same quarter last year.
After years of defying gravity, Boston Scientific executives said Wednesday that cardiac-rhythm management (CRM) device sales are likely to fall into line with the rest of the industry.
“The last couple of years, Boston has been able to grow faster than the CRM market,” particularly in sales of implantable defibrillators, Denhoy said. “What they acknowledged [Wednesday] is that they can’t run faster than the market for a period of time here, and so their growth is really going to mirror this flat-to-down [trend] of the broader CRM segment. That’s a concern because it’s 20% of this company’s revenue.”
The outperformance in earnings stemmed mainly from a tax benefit. Brennan said the company’s effective tax rate during the quarter was unexpectedly low, at 4.5%. A Jan. 14 news release previewing the earnings call mentioned a “significant” tax benefit was recognized during the quarter related to “an intra-entity transfer of intellectual property.”
Analysts at SVB Leerink said Wednesday that they continue to stand behind the stock. The firm noted several product launches in 2020 that will drive new revenue, including the Exalt-D duodenoscope, a single-use device that is intended to replace durable scopes that may transmit microbes between patients because they are difficult to wash between uses.
Looking ahead, Boston Scientific expects organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% in the first quarter of 2020, which would have been 6% to 7.5% without the effect of the coronavirus. Revenue growth was 6.3% in the same quarter last year.
The company projects first-quarter 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of 37 to 40 cents per share, compared with 36 cents of EPS a year ago.
For the full year 2020, Boston Scientific is projecting organic-revenue growth between 6.5% and 8.5%, and adjusted EPS in a range from $1.74 to $1.79 per share.
That guidance includes the Q1 coronavirus effect, but contemplates a return to normal surgical volumes for the rest of the year.
In 2019, Boston Scientific’s $10.7 billion in revenue represented 7.3% organic growth and translated to $1.58 in adjusted EPS."

Globalization makes people highly portable across borders, but supply chains are far more global in their nature than the movement of people. In the case of China, this is not surprising. The country now has a $14 trillion economy, quadruple what it was in 2003.
Earlier this week, Hyundai Motor Co. announced it was suspending vehicle manufacturing in South Korea for three days due to disruptions in its Chinese supply chain. And Apple’s stock is off more than 5% from late January’s all-time high as the epidemic has raised concerns about its Chinese supply chain.
A recent Gartner Group study outlined the dangers and best practices for dealing with potential disruptions to global supply chains originating in China from the coronavirus. According to the author, Sarah Hippold: “As the coronavirus outbreak spreads rapidly and exceeds the SARS outbreak in 2003, supply-chain leaders must mitigate instant disruption and plan for future incidents. … Although the outbreak is being compared to the 2003 SARS outbreak, China is now much more developed and integrated with the global economy, and the country has significantly improved its transportation networks. This means the supply-chain implications go beyond regional concerns.”
What should companies do to prepare their supply chains for disruption? The Gartner report offer several recommendations:
Short term. Develop a plan for increasing supply-chain transparency in high-risk countries affected by the virus.
Medium term. Balance supply and demand and build buffer stock, as well as diversify the supplier ecosystem in other countries.
Long term. Plan and prepare for future disruptions, avoiding locating high-value nodes of manufacturing for key components in single countries or regions.
Adjusting in the face of disruptions to account for potential pandemics means adjusting just-in-time manufacturing and lean management processes to provide buffers and the ability to manage the change more efficiently and creatively than competitors."
"February 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/middle-ground-recedes-in-politics-media-and-even-relationships/567673652/,StarTribune,"Middle ground recedes in politics, media and even relationships","Wow — what a week.
Or was it a year?
Sure seemed like it, given the speed and pace of the news narrative.
Recall, Thursday, Jan. 30, the Senate rejected new witnesses and even evidence in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
As Friday, Jan. 31, turned to Saturday at midnight Brussels time (chronologically and politically), Brexit (finally) became official.
On Sunday, Feb. 2, amid some compelling commercials and a controversial halftime show, the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV.
On Monday, Iowa’s caucus convulsed (counting and controversy, continued).
On Tuesday, a rejected handshake and a ripped-up speech marked, and marred, Trump’s State of the Union Address.
And on Wednesday, with the notable, and to some noble, exception of Mitt Romney, Republican senators quickly acquitted Trump.
Then this past Thursday, the week wound up anew, as Trump denounced key impeachment figures as “leakers, liars, dirty cops and scum,” among other insults, at an off-the-cuff (and at times off-the-rails) White House speech.
Friday’s Democratic debate before Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary (which has new urgency after Iowa’s woes) will have bracketted a split-screen weekend tracking two consequential contests — candidates on the hustings, hustling votes in snowy New Hampshire, and stars alighting the red carpet in sunny Hollywood at Sunday’s Academy Awards.
Meanwhile, international issues, as well as transnational challenges like the climate and coronavirus crises, accelerate the news cycle, leading some to tune it out altogether (as many did the State of the Union, which had 20% fewer viewers than last year).
For those still riveted to stories about a nation riven with divisions, where citizens get their news increasingly reflects — and perhaps aggravates — the widening divide.
That’s among the conclusions gleaned from new Pew Research Center polls, including an extensive analysis, “U.S. Media Polarization and the 2020 Election: A Nation Divided,” that examines news sources “Americans trust, distrust and rely on.”
Republicans and Democrats, Pew states, “place their trust in two nearly inverse news media environments.” And perhaps not surprisingly, but importantly, “these divides are even more pronounced between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats” — just the type of ideologically driven individuals more likely to caucus or vote in primaries, and serve as the key target for cable news networks whose business models depend on an engaged, if not enraged, audience.
Among the data on partisan choices for news are these key takeaways: Of 30 news sources Pew examined, Democrats trust more than distrust 22 of them, while Republicans distrust more than 20. And that gap has grown into a gulf since the last time Pew polled on the subject, in 2014. Since then, “Republicans have grown increasingly alienated from most of the more established sources, while Democrats’ confidence in them remains stable, and in some cases, has strengthened,” the study states.
While there is a raft of stats on 30 outlets, two news networks stand out. “In the more compact Republican media ecosystem, one outlet towers above all others: Fox News. It would be hard to overstate its connection as a go-to source of political news for Republicans,” Pew reports on the network trusted by 65% of Republicans and Republican leaners. Meanwhile, Democrats have a longer list of trusted sources, yet CNN has a similar level of trust (67%) for Democrats and Democratic leaners.
Overall, “both sides are moving,” Amy Mitchell, director of journalism research at Pew, said in an interview. “Democrats are becoming more positive generally about the news media when you ask a range of different questions; Republicans are generally becoming more negative following the 2016 election.”
Some of the Republican negativity since ’16 is likely because of how they perceive reporting on the president. And some is likely due to presidential rhetoric, with Trump falsely calling accurate but unflattering coverage “fake news” and slandering some elements of the news media with Stalinesque “enemy of the people” language.
Media selection has certainly played out in how people perceive the events of this dizzying week, including impeachment. In fact, “views about Ukraine-impeachment connect closely with where Americans get their news,” according to another Pew poll that said 65% of Republicans and Republican leaners “who got their political news only from media outlets with right-leaning audiences said he [Trump] did it to advance a U.S. policy to reduce corruption in Ukraine.” Among GOPers who got their news from a combination of outlet types, only 46% said so. And a plurality of 34% of those who didn’t get their news from any of the partisan outlets said it was because Trump “wanted to help his re-election campaign.”
As for Democrats and Democratic leaners? They, well, leaned differently, in part reflecting media selection. Of those who got news from “only those outlets with left-leaning audiences,” 75% said Trump’s motive was re-election, while only 4% said it was corruption fighting.
Of course, correlation is not causation; news viewers may select these outlets because they augment their argument, not challenge it. But the data suggests that just as red and blue states and cities seem to be turning deeper shades, people vote with their remote controls, too.
Which may be making us more remote from each other.
Forty-five percent of Americans “have stopped talking about political and election news with someone as a result of something they said, either in person or online,” according to a separate Pew poll. And just as with the ideological intensity driving divisions in media usage, the most partisan are the most likely to allow political divisions to sever dialogue. This is especially the case for self-described liberal Democrats, with 60% reporting a cessation of political dialogue.
Among the etymological interpretations of the word “media” is “middle ground” — a place fewer are choosing politically, in their media consumption, and even in their personal relationships, which is something that should give pause, even in a nonstop news cycle."
"February 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesota-braces-for-coronavirus-concerns/567697322/,StarTribune,University of Minnesota braces for coronavirus concerns,"Zi Ting Wang returned to the University of Minnesota two weeks ago after visiting family in Zhe Jiang, China, where her parents remain quarantined at home amid the coronavirus outbreak.
She arrived back at a campus just beginning to face the outbreak as it threatens to take root in this country. Some students have been seen wearing medical masks, and the university has placed sanitation stations around campus, offering free tissue, hand sanitizer and medical masks.
“My parents are always warning me to wash your hands frequently, don’t talk with anybody outside of the home and to just keep in touch,” Wang said.
Minnesota’s flagship university is among a growing number of higher education institutions across the country where health officials are balancing the need to inform their students about the rapidly spreading virus without exaggerating the threat and nudging their campuses toward hysteria.
The dilemma is particularly acute at the university, which is home to 3,000 Chinese students and 230 Chinese professors and staff who are constantly traveling back and forth to their home country.
The campus is not in panic mode over the virus, said Dave Golden, director of public health and communications for the U’s Boynton Health. His office is continually updating a health alert webpage as the virus spreads across the country.
The U suspended its study abroad programming in China for this spring semester and Golden has fielded a few inquiries from staff at the U wondering if an Asian student exhibiting signs of a cold or flu should be allowed in class. The answer is yes, he said.
The campus pharmacy has sold about 8,000 boxes of medical masks, with more on order, and students have picked clean the boxes of free masks at the campus sanitation stations. But the run on masks is not a fresh sign of panic.
Wang said she knows students who have bought them to send to family and friends in China, where there are widespread shortages. So far China has reported 24,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus and nearly 500 deaths.
Jasmine Hak, 22, of Chanhassen, who’s of Chinese and Cambodian heritage, said her concerns are more about the spread of suspicion or mistrust of Asians rather than the virus itself. She said the virus is “not an excuse to be racist.”
U professor Erika Lee said coronavirus is sparking widespread xenophobia directed toward Asians. Though Lee has not experienced this personally, she’s read reports from across the country about Asian students being viewed with suspicion. A professor at the University of Connecticut is chronicling such accounts and news reports.
“Targeting Asian or Asian-appearing individuals when they cough and accusing them of being sick and them spreading viruses, there’s a real racial layering that’s happening with that behavior. And what I’ve been helping to illustrate is just how deep rooted the idea is that immigrants are carriers of dangerous diseases,” Lee said.
Joan Brzezinski, executive director of the UMN China Center, said “viruses don’t discriminate — they will attack and hurt anyone.”
College and university campuses are particularly prone to the rapid spread of viruses and other illnesses. Tight quarters where students learn, gather and recreate allows illness to spread rapidly. For their part, college dorms can quickly magnify an outbreak.
The University of Massachusetts Boston and Arizona State University each have a confirmed case of coronavirus, fueling fears and emergency responses.
Two students from Wuhan at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville were placed in special on-campus housing, as reported by the New York Times, but the university has since announced the 14-day incubation period set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had passed.
So far, the virus has not hit Minnesota, where three suspected cases of coronavirus all tested negative. In the U.S., there are 12 confirmed cases and 76 pending.
A new case was confirmed in neighboring Wisconsin at the UW Health Hospital. It’s unknown if the patient diagnosed with the novel virus last week is a student or employee of UW-Madison.
The patient recently returned from Beijing after traveling to the virus’ country of origin for the Chinese New Year. Many international students, including those at the U Twin Cities campus, had similar travel plans.
Golden, Boynton’s spokesman, said the University of Minnesota’s response to the coronavirus is much more muted than the last big outbreak, influenza H1N1, in 2009. When H1N1 hit, he said hundreds of U students were quarantined in dorms.
With the coronavirus, Golden said, a couple of them were placed in isolation rooms at Boynton for screening as a precautionary measure. Students with flu-like symptoms who recently traveled to China and have a cough or fever are being asked to come into Boynton for screening.
Meanwhile, health officials are carefully measuring their response to the coronavirus amid a looming threat from a far more common and dangerous virus with similar symptoms. So far this flu season, the number of influenza-related deaths in Minnesota has reached 42.
Brzezinski said there has been a lot of calming coronavirus communication on campus.
“Everyone here is on top of anticipating what messages need to go out so people feel comfortable and informed,” she said."
"February 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-man-waits-out-quarantine-after-visit-to-wuhan/567743062/,StarTribune,Minneapolis man waits out quarantine after visit to Wuhan,"Yulin Yin was just starting to relax and fall into routine on day six of his 14-day quarantine in San Diego — with the anxiety and jet lag from an evacuation flight out of Wuhan, China, behind him — when the Minneapolis man got the news that everyone on his flight feared.
One of the 167 evacuees on that flight ended up sick due to an infection of novel coronavirus.
“Now I just want to make sure I am healthy so I don’t bring the virus to Minnesota,” said Yin, an IT professional. Yin, 48, was on one of five special flights that carried hundreds of U.S. citizens and immediate relatives out of Wuhan — the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak.
The infection was confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday night after the traveler had been separated from Yin and the rest of the evacuees, who were placed under quarantine at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego. The traveler had been placed in isolation at UC San Diego Health, along with four others who had exhibited symptoms but had been found not to have the virus.
Other evacuees from Wuhan have been placed under quarantine in Los Angeles and Omaha, because it appears to take up to 14 days for symptoms to emerge in people infected with the novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV.
The evidence also suggests that people are infectious only when they have symptoms, so holding evacuees until it is clear they are symptom-free is one way to make sure they don’t spread the virus in the U.S., Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the CDC said last week.
“Now is the time to act so that we can slow the introduction and impact of this virus in the U.S.,” she said.
Yin gratefully accepted the quarantine as a condition of taking one of the evacuation flights out of Wuhan, though he said it has been odd to be penned in with strangers who are keeping their distance in case anyone is infected.
“We’re just supposed to keep a social distance of six feet away,” he said.
Yin has embraced Twitter, posting videos and pictures of his temporary life in the bachelor quarters of Miramar, but he is also trying to filter and forward the latest credible information about the virus to his family. He jogs along the perimeter fence, which is about the size of a high school track, and phones and texts when he isn’t meeting with health officials or having his temperature taken.
The novel coronavirus emerged at a fish market in Wuhan in late December and has since been identified in more than 42,000 cases and 1,000 deaths in China — including the death of an American citizen in Wuhan. More than 400 cases have been reported in other countries, including 13 in the U.S.
The CDC has reported only two cases of domestic person-to-person transmission — both involving returnees from China who infected spouses — and stress that the risk to the American public is low.
Yin grew up in Wuhan and returned there to visit his parents and see old schoolmates for the Chinese New Year.
When he left Minneapolis, news had started circulating about the virus, but concern of a global outbreak didn’t emerge until after he reached Wuhan on Jan. 20. China then issued a lockdown on Jan. 23 that prevented people from leaving the city.
Yin’s focus switched to keeping his family safe — especially his parents, given that the virus appears to hit the elderly and sick hardest — and getting back to Minnesota before all flights out of China were canceled.
“Even if he got sick, he’s [otherwise] healthy,” his wife, Ann Yin, said at their home in north Minneapolis with one of their daughters. “We weren’t getting into that panic. It’s more like, ‘The world is panicking and cutting off China from everything, and we need you back home!’ “
She sought help from Minnesota’s congressional delegation to get Yin on one of the evacuation flights.
Yin said he felt safe from infection in his parents’ home and used the time to record a video interview with them. He felt nervous when he left that protective bubble on the drive to the airport.
Once in San Diego, Yin was overcome with emotion.
“While I was in Wuhan, I was nervous, experienced insomnia, anxiety,” he said in a tweet. “And I was afraid of people. I was afraid to touch anything from outside. On the first night of quarantine, I wept uncontrollably. I was the lucky one, I had hope of help.”
Yin said he is grateful for all the help. Health care workers at the site are coincidentally volunteers from Minnesota who are part of a U.S. Disaster Medical Assistance Team. Food and laundry are provided, and Yin received his laptop after some delays so he could work remotely.
At a meeting Monday night, Yin said he was told that the infection involved a woman who had minimal contact with others at the compound and was unlikely to have spread the coronavirus. Even so, he wondered if he would be traveling home as hoped on Feb. 18, which would be 14 days after his flight out of China, or whether his quarantine would be extended.
Yin had his own scare in San Diego when he coughed, but he discovered it was from the same warm-weather allergies he experiences every spring in Minnesota.
The family is trying to stay positive until Yin returns home. Yin even laughed about the good fortune of being assigned to sunny San Diego compared to other evacuees flown to colder Omaha. He gloated to his wife during one phone call about how he enjoyed a great sleep and had the free time for a leisurely run in the sun.
“I wanted to punch him,” she said with a laugh."
"February 11, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/report-on-biggest-threats-to-u-s-is-a-thinly-disguised-shakedown/567766862/,StarTribune,Report on biggest threats to U.S. is thinly disguised shakedown,"PARIS — In case you were wondering why you should hide under the covers these days (aside from the coronavirus), the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center has just released a report itemizing the top threats facing the country.
The first question we should be asking is why such a report is published at all. One shouldn’t require a report from Washington dictating what to fear. We should be able to look around on a daily basis and see what presents a threat. Typically, that would mean muggings, theft and other garden-variety domestic criminality. Government investment would then flow to local policing in a bid to curtail these crimes. The impact of the increased funding would be measurable in terms of local crime reduction.
The problem with that scenario is that military-industrial-complex shareholders wouldn’t be getting paid. The fear industry is big business for both government and its private contractors, and we can’t have beat cops getting all the funding to actually do something measurably useful.
So here comes a federal report to instruct you on what you need to fear. The report also serves as a blueprint for how to funnel cash into the pockets of federal agencies and their military-industrial cronies to keep the charade going. The government is here to tell you what poses a danger to you. Ready?
Among the countries listed as “actors targeting the United States” is Cuba. Seriously. Ay, caramba! Let’s panic like its 1962! The report fails to offer any specific explanation of the purported Cuban threat to America, leaving it to you to fantasize about your fate at the hands of the Cuban government in the post-Castro era. It’s like one of those “choose your own adventure” books. Perhaps the government couldn’t meet the challenge of explaining how a tiny island nation crippled by decades of sanctions could pose any kind of danger to an economic, technological and military superpower.
Next up, the Axis of Perpetual Government Spending: Iran, North Korea, Russia and China. Walk up to any 10 people at Costco as they sling trays of giant muffins into their carts and ask whether they feel that their way of life is threatened by any of these countries. Or, as a fellow motorist sits fuming in gridlocked Los Angeles traffic, sucking in smog against a wildfire-charred landscape, lower your window and ask: “Excuse me, sir, aren’t you grateful that the federal government has decided to spare no cost in fighting the biggest menaces to your well-being — Vladimir Putin, Ali Khamenei and Kim Jong Un?”
For those who aren’t convinced that nation-states on the other side of the planet represent an imminent danger, the government has also tossed in a few shadowy entities, including ISIS and al-Qaida. Never mind that it was U.S. government support for the so-called “Syrian rebels” that strengthened ISIS and al-Qaida in the first place. These terrorist groups, inadvertently fueled by $500 million of your tax cash, will now be defeated with another blank check written by you. That is, if the government doesn’t first use it to wipe out the jihadist mop-up crew otherwise known as Hezbollah, which is also on the National Counterintelligence and Security Center’s list of enemies.
Finally, “ideologically motivated entities” such as “public disclosure organizations” are included as a new threat to American security, including those that may not have formal ties to any foreign intelligence services. That sounds an awful lot like a description of adversarial journalism — the kind that routinely uncovers government wrongdoing, manipulation and abuse of the public trust. It’s almost as if the government is afraid of losing its monopoly on narratives that it wants to sell to the public in pursuit of its agendas. If not for “public disclosure organizations” and facts that the establishment considers inconvenient, America’s sons and daughters likely would have been sent to risk their lives in more pointless wars to defend little more than the economic interests of an elite few.
National security has become grossly synonymous with financial security — not for the average American, but for those who rely on the endless flow of your tax dollars. The audience for this report is meant to be you — not so much to inform you about threats you can do nothing about, but rather to convince you that you need protection from far-flung menaces and that you must pay government for that privilege."
"February 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/target-best-buy-could-be-hit-by-supply-chain-disruptions-because-of-coronavirus/567819212/,StarTribune,"Target, Best Buy could be hit by supply-chain disruptions because of coronavirus","Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. Inc. could be among the first U.S. companies to take a direct hit from the corona­virus outbreak as concerns grow about disruptions to supply chain networks in China.
Although existing inventories are strong at most of the nation’s big-box retailers, analysts from Wells Fargo warn that shoppers could start seeing empty store shelves as early as mid-April.
“We believe the time to start to worry about the supply chain risk ... is here,” the report said.
Almost 60 million Chinese workers remain quarantined in their homes, and others are staying away from work, afraid of catching the virus at crowded factories. So far, there have been more than 42,000 confirmed cases of the corona­virus and more than 1,000 deaths.
As a result, there have been “dramatic reductions in activity” across China, and operations have been slow to restart following the Lunar New Year holiday, the Wells Fargo report said. Retailers have started to express concerns.
Minnesota-based Target and Best Buy declined to comment on how the outbreak is affecting their businesses. But Wells Fargo said the two companies, along with Walmart, Dick’s Sporting Goods and G-III Apparel Group, are among 19 retailers considered at high risk of supply-chain disruption.
Target and Walmart “are more heavily dependent on a shorter lead time replenishment model,” the report said.
Although retailers have been looking to shift production to other parts of Asia, much of the raw materials come from China.
The next few weeks are key, depending on how quickly people in China go back to work. American consumers might begin to see out-of-stock items starting within 60 to 90 days, stretching well into midsummer if disruptions continue, according to a team of analysts led by Edward Kelly.
“While there is finished product sitting in factories and distribution centers in China, our contacts have indicated that almost nothing is moving over the water or by air at the moment,” the report said.
Scott MacDonald, who owns the Minnetonka-based manufacturers’ rep firm Mac & Mac, said one of his patio furniture suppliers had only 700 of its 7,000 Chinese workers show up for work Monday, the first day of business following an extended Chinese New Year holiday.
Mac & Mac and other companies that work with China are figuring out how to deal with the work delays.
MacDonald said his client believes that workers can’t get to the factory because of transportation disruptions. Whatever the cause, many companies could be hamstrung by a lack of raw material shipments in the coming weeks.
This week, a client complained that a container ship headed to a dock in Hangzhou — 10 hours from the epicenter of the outbreak in Hubei province — couldn’t get to the port. MacDonald said it wasn’t clear if the Chinese government had shut down the port or if the ship captain simply refused to dock for fear of the virus.
Either way, his client’s products “had to be booked on a different vessel” so they could get to their final destination, he said.
MacDonald said his big-box retail customers are concerned, especially as they hear reports that planes in China may have been refused permission to land in some cities and were diverted to other airports. “Everyone is looking at this because it is definitely going to affect business and shipping.”
It is unclear whether continued travel bans and factory shutdowns in China will affect supply chains long term.
Arctic Cat’s factory in Thief River Falls, Minn., uses some Chinese components in its vehicles, including its new Tracker Off Road four-wheelers, but the company has seen no effect so far, said Dave Sylvestre, a spokesman for Arctic Cat’s parent, Textron.
“At this time, our Minnesota plants are operating normally,” said Brandon Haddock, spokesman for Textron Specialty Vehicles.
Shakopee-based Entrust Datacard, which makes data security products, credit card printers and automated ad printers for banks around the world, buys less than 10% of its supplies from vendors in China and is already adjusting to life “after” the outbreak.
During and after the Chinese New Year, it shut down its sales, service and IT offices in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Suzhou and Beijing. It asked its digital associates in China, Singapore and Hong Kong to work from home until the crisis passes.
The company has 50 employees in China and 350 across Asia. It canceled all unnecessary travel from China to customers around Asia. It has struggled to get its workers face masks, which are in short supply because they are being hoarded by hospitals in China.
“We talked to one of our [team members] today who is in Hong Kong, where there are very small homes. And she is there in the apartment with both of her parents. It’s tight,” and demoralizing not to have the freedom to leave, said Chief Human Resources Officer Beth Klehr. “So keeping everyone’s spirits up is very important to us. What we are hearing is that it’s very important to them to be able to keep working.”
Separately, Entrust Datacard is scrambling to replace workers affected by travel bans with others who can still meet with customers outside of China. And it’s racing to get supplies from Chinese vendors “that we need to build here” in Shakopee, Klehr said. “That’s our biggest challenge.”
So far, alternate suppliers are being found and no production delays are expected in Shakopee, a spokesman said.
At St. Paul-based Ecolab, which makes hand sanitizers and disinfectants for hotels, restaurants and factories worldwide, has 3,000 workers in China and has shipped “large quantities” of face masks to its workers. Now it’s scrambling to keep up with production. “We are doing all we can to support the country’s efforts to contain the virus and also help our associates and customers remain safe,” said spokesman Roman Blahoski.
Ecolab kept its hand soap factory in Taicang operating part-time during the holiday and in the past week reopened plants in Nanjing and Guangzhou.
“We are seeing an increase in demand for our hygiene and infection prevention solutions, but conversely, China’s economy is experiencing broad disruption,” Blahoski said. “At this time, we do not see indications that our production will be disrupted as a result of this outbreak, but this is an evolving situation. And we are unable to foresee the full impact it may have on our operations.”"
"February 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/scientists-race-to-design-coronavirus-vaccine/567859972/,StarTribune,Scientists race to design coronavirus vaccine,"Faraz Zaidi and Daniel Park peered at a series of small, black blots that appeared on a clear sheet of plastic — confirming they had created a type of protein that, until January, was unknown to science.
It was alerting them to the presence of the microscopic “spikes” on a coronavirus.
From the moment the Chinese government published the microbe’s genetic code in January, scientists such as Zaidi and Park have been racing to develop a vaccine. The pair work in the lab of David B. Weiner at Philadelphia’s Wistar Institute, which is collaborating with Inovio Pharmaceuticals and others to deliver a vaccine within months. That’s a fast timetable, made possible by an approach Weiner helped pioneer.
Unlike traditional vaccines, which contain killed or weakened forms of the virus in question, Inovio’s product contains genetic instructions to make just a fragment of a virus: a single type of protein.
The old method requires extensive testing to ensure the weakened viruses will not make anyone sick. The newer DNA vaccines can be proven safe much more quickly, said Weiner, who serves on Inovio’s board. “If you wanted to do this the old-fashioned way, we’d be talking about a many year project,” he said.
Whether the immune system is being exposed to a weakened or killed virus, or just a fragment, the goal is the same: teaching the body to defend itself should it ever encounter a real infection.
Several other teams around the world also are working on a vaccine. People who become infected with coronavirus tend to develop mild symptoms such as a cough, and recover on their own. But a minority of patients have come down with severe, pneumonia-like symptoms.
Inovio scientists “printed” their vaccine in hours with a DNA synthesizer: a computerized system that fuses chemical base pairs in the correct order. However, testing its safety and effectiveness in humans will take months.
In the lab, Zaidi and Park were testing one of several versions of the vaccine — verifying that the instructions would cause the correct proteins to be made. Other tests were underway to ensure that the proteins were triggering an immune response, in the form of white blood cells called T-cells.
The proteins are the ones that give the coronavirus family its name: the spikes on the outer edge of each virus particle, giving the appearance of a corona, or crown, like the fringe surrounding a solar eclipse.
Other viruses for which vaccines have been made with this approach include Ebola, HIV and MERS, a different type of coronavirus.
These DNA vaccines are not administered in the usual way, because if you simply injected DNA into a person’s bloodstream, enzymes would degrade it before it had a chance to penetrate cells.
Instead, DNA vaccines are administered with a device that has several metal probes on the end. The probes are placed against the skin, delivering a small electric current that opens tiny pores in skin cells, Weiner said.
These cellular “micropores” remain open for just a split second, long enough to take in about 1,000 copies of the necessary DNA instructions in each cell. The vaccine remains confined to cells in that immediate patch of skin. “It’s all just local,” Weiner said.
The cells then make the proteins, which teach the immune system how to mount a two-pronged response: learning to create both the infection-fighting T-cells and B-cells.
Testing in lab animals is expected to be finished by late spring, said J. Joseph Kim, the president and CEO of Inovio. The goal is to start human tests in early summer, he said. “The virus is spreading quite rapidly,” Kim said. “We believe the vaccine development has to match that speed.”"
"February 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/people-always-forget-their-thumbs-mayo-doctor-s-late-night-tv-cameo-on-handwashing-worth-another-look/567891192/,StarTribune,People always forget their thumbs.' Mayo doctor's late-night TV cameo on handwashing worth another look.,"Most of us are flunking handwashing. That’s an important public health message at any time, but especially during the height of the winter influenza season — one complicated by the emergence of COVID-19, the name given to the coronavirus that got its start in Wuhan, China, and has since spread across the world.
While researchers put the rush on developing treatments for this new pathogen, it’s good to remember how powerful low-tech, individual interventions like handwashing can be in combating disease. But doing it properly is key. That’s why it’s worth revisiting a Mayo Clinic doctor’s 2016 appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! late-night talk show. The video is now on YouTube and Mayo’s web site.
Dr. Greg Poland, an infectious disease and vaccine specialist, flew to Los Angeles to do a handwashing tutorial for Kimmel, his sidekick Guillermo Rodriguez and the show’s viewers. The event took place in a men’s room, and Poland doesn’t waste any time in critiquing inadequate handwashing habits. “Almost nobody knows how to do it,’’ Poland said.
The subsequent footage bears this out. Poland puts gel on the pair’s hands to mimic bacteria, viruses and other unwelcome substances that too often lurk there. Kimmel and Rodriguez both do a quick wash with soap and water. Their casual rinse looks familiar to anyone who has used a public restroom.
When the lights are dimmed, a black light wielded by Poland shows hands that aren’t even close to clean. The leftover gel glows around the pairs’ fingernails, on their hands’ sides, and especially, their thumbs. “People always forget their thumbs,’’ Poland said.
Thorough handwashing, according to Poland, involves a good 20 to 30 seconds of vigorous scrubbing, starting from the fingertips and working up the hands from there.

"February 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/coronavirus-effects-on-the-oil-industry-likely-to-affect-north-dakota/567890302/,StarTribune,Coronavirus effects on the oil industry likely to affect North Dakota,"North Dakota oil and natural gas output fell up to 3% in December, while the state's minerals director cautioned that the coronavirus outbreak could weaken production in the coming months.
The nation's second-largest oil producer after Texas, North Dakota pumped out 1.48 million barrels of oil per day in December, down 2.85% from the previous month, according to data released Friday by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. December gas production tallied 3.06 million MCF per day, down 2.45% from November. (An MCF is 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas.)
""Unfortunately, there's not a lot of candy and roses in today's report,"" Lynn Helms, the mineral department's director, said in a webcast that fell on Valentine's Day.
Still, oil production during December was close to the historic monthly highs that North Dakota hit in October and November, when production topped 1.5 million barrels per day.
The oil-rig count in North Dakota currently stands at 56, up a tad from the 55 mark in November through January, though down from the low to mid-60s earlier in 2019. A rising rig count is an indicator of more new wells being drilled. Helms said operators see the rig count hovering around the mid-50s for much of 2020.
The oil industry has weathered a shock recently with the spread of coronavirus and consequent fears of declining global oil demand, particularly in China. That country is the world's largest importer of oil and second-largest economy.
""It's definitely 'batten down the hatches' in the oil and gas industry, even in North Dakota,"" Helms said.
OPEC, the global-oil cartel, earlier this week lowered its global-demand forecast largely due to the coronavirus outbreak. Also this week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration cut its global oil-demand forecast, the result of an economic slowdown in China caused by the illness that has infected more than 60,000 people and killed more than 1,000.
Oil prices have taken a hit this year as the coronavirus has spread.
The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) — the benchmark U.S. crude — dropped from $63 a barrel in early January to a one-year low on Monday of just under $50. WTI closed Friday at around $52 a barrel, rallying in recent days.
On a different front, North Dakota's natural gas capture rate improved a bit in December, though it's still below the state's goals.
Oil and gas operators captured 84% of the natural gas they produced, flaring — or burning off — the rest. In November, the gas-capture rate was 83%, while the state's goal is 88% with only 12% flaring. The flaring of natural gas is wasteful and bad for the environment.
The state's gas-capture infrastructure — pipelines and processing plants — hasn't kept up with the production of gas, which is essentially a byproduct of oil production. Helms said that December's decline in oil output was largely caused by operators purposely curtailing production to limit flaring."
"February 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/stock-valuations-elevated-but-not-yet-peaked/567844672/,StarTribune,"Stock valuations elevated, but not yet peaked","An old Wall Street axiom suggests the stock market is the only place in the world where buyers are more comfortable paying a higher price for the product. If that’s the case, the line at the checkout counter is about to get longer.
The S&P 500 stock index now trades at 19 times forward earnings estimates, its highest valuation in more than a decade and nearly 15% above its 5-year average price-to-earnings ratio. There’s no denying the majority of U.S. stocks have become more expensive. What most people really want to know: “Is it still a good time to invest in equities?”
Every investor wants to buy low and sell high. Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are a helpful tool to determine whether a company (or an index) appears cheap or expensive.
Most readers of this column know the S&P 500 increased almost 30% last year. What you may not realize is nearly all of those gains can be attributed to an increase in the market’s multiple rather than an increase in earnings.
Data compiled by Goldman Sachs show that 92% of the S&P’s 2019 gains were due to expansion in the benchmark’s P/E ratio. Only 8% of the gains were attributable to earnings growth. For the sake of comparison, more than two-thirds (68%) of the S&P’s total gains since March 2009 are the result of earnings growth, with only 32% due to P/E expansion.
Put another way, investors bid up the stock market in 2019 anticipating that future earnings would make that bet pay off. A lot needs to go right in order to justify currently lofty valuations. If the latest earnings are any indication, however, most companies are on the right path.
With fourth-quarter reporting season nearly complete, the index is on pace for year-over-year earnings growth of 0.7%. That might not sound impressive, but it’s well above the 1.7% earnings decline that was forecast as of year-end.
Also significant is that the companies with the most influence on benchmark performance (remember the S&P 500 is market-cap weighted) continue to be some of the best performers.
Valuations are elevated, but it’s unlikely they have peaked. In the last 11 economic cycles, equity prices tended to top out when the benchmark’s P/E reached a 25% premium to its five-year average. With the S&P currently trading at a 15% premium to its five-year average, there is still room for this bull market to run. Another quarter of strong earnings would lengthen that runway.
Political uncertainty and the fallout from coronavirus may increase short-term volatility, but neither, in our view, present a major long-term obstacle. As for historical comparisons, remember that none of those previous bull markets benefited from the exceptionally friendly Fed policy still in place today. All signs point toward the Fed remaining neutral in 2020, which means a favorable environment for stocks and persistently low yields from alternative asset classes like bonds and cash.
Recent fund flows may also provide more fuel for equities. Investors withdrew more than $41 billion (net) from equity funds in 2019, according to Morningstar. Such behavior rarely coincides with market peaks.
More likely, we remain in the later stages of this economic expansion. The relative upside for stocks may not be as high as a year ago, but as long as earnings deliver, the upside remains."

That should give us more than a little pause. As some Americans continue to scoff at best health practices, including appropriate vaccines for the flu, how ready are we to handle a viral pandemic?
Some 10,000 Americans have died of the flu this year; 180,000 have been hospitalized.
“Please, it is not too late to get a flu shot, and there are measures we can all take that can help keep us healthy this season,” Connecticut Department of Public Heath Commissioner Renée D. Coleman-Mitchell said in announcing the flu death of a young child in her state.
Plenty of people are still basking in misinformation, with sometimes deadly results. The mother of a 4-year-old Colorado boy consulted an anti-vaccine Facebook group when flu hit her house, according to media reports. She wrote that she had declined to fill a Tamiflu prescription written by a doctor, NBC News reported, but was treating her children with peppermint oil and lavender. Members advised her to use breast milk, thyme and elderberry. Her son died. Facebook said it is trying to reduce the spread of vaccine misinformation on its site.
Celebrity-studded anti-vax debates run the risk of becoming a parlor game or something of a joke. Instead, the urgent need to corral the coronavirus is a sobering reminder that public health is serious business. People who defy widely accepted precautions aren’t just quirky oddballs. By ignoring medical advice and common sense, they endanger themselves, their children, the medically vulnerable and potentially everyone around them.
The results of not taking the flu seriously can be deadly."

The liquidity that resulted when central banks, including the Federal Reserve, lowered rates created an ""extraordinary return paradigm"" last year, Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock Inc., said in a speech last week to the CFA Society of Minnesota, a group of hundreds of financial analysts.
""There's no way we can repeat that this year,"" he said.
Investors have been on a roller coaster for the past two years. Nothing went right in 2018, when stocks fell 7% and U.S. Treasuries 2%, and then everything went right last year. Stocks rose around 25%, corporate bonds were up in the midteens and U.S. Treasuries, which tend to fall when stocks rise, instead returned 14.9%.
The difference, Rieder said, came when the Fed ended a four-year period of slowly tightening monetary policy. Fed policymakers cut interest rates three times in 2019 and in October began to buy short-term Treasuries again for the first time since 2014.
The central bank from 2014 to 2019 shed bonds and shrank its balance sheet, which it built to record levels to provide stimulus in the aftermath of the 2008 credit crisis and recession.
Other central banks, including those in Europe and Japan, also opened the spigots on liquidity last year. And now, with the coronavirus slowing China's economy, the central bank in Beijing is also infusing money into that economy.
Rieder said interest rates are likely to remain low for years to come. A member of an industry advisory panel to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Rieder said rates are being held down by more forces than the desire of central banks to keep economies healthy.
The biggest: All around the world, aging populations are relying more heavily on income from insurance and pensions, asset classes that are roaring upward in size. ""The aging of the population globally is the most extraordinary dynamic that we've ever seen,"" Rieder said.
Because insurance and pension assets are growing so quickly, an average of $1.3 trillion of new money will come into global investment markets each year for the next 10 years. Those institutions tend to invest conservatively, heavily in fixed-income investments like bonds.
""There's not enough bonds"" for the supply of money that's washing in, Rieder said. With demand outweighing supply, fixed-income assets won't need to pay more to attract money. ""It's very hard for interest rates to go higher to any significant magnitude,"" he said.
Rieder said BlackRock, which has about $7 trillion in assets under management, this year is building fixed-income portfolios to return around 4% to 5%. It expects equities to return around 10% and alternative investments around 12%.
Institutional investors, money managers and pension funds that get a 5% return in fixed income are setting themselves up for a good year, Rieder said. ""It's a different playbook than last year,"" he said."

Apple on Monday warned that it expects to fall short of revenue goals in the current quarter, underscoring the far-reaching effects of the public health crisis on the global economy. In a statement to investors, Apple said that while factories in China were reopening, iPhone production in the country was ramping up more slowly than expected. Demand for Apple products has also dampened in China, where all the company's stores and many of its partner stores have temporarily shuttered.
Communist Party may delay meeting
China signaled that it would postpone its most important political spectacle of the year, a sign of deepening anxiety within the ruling Communist Party about the threat posed by the virus epidemic. Chinese officials said the annual fall meeting of the National People's Congress, which typically takes place in early March, could be delayed because of the outbreak.
School classes in China are now online
Nearly 200 million kids across China started their second semester on Monday. But it was a school day unlike anything they had before the Lunar New Year holiday. Most Chinese schools had been due to resume classes but have instead moved to some kind of online or home learning system, straining the resources of teachers, the attention of kids and the patience of parents.
China says 80% of cases have been mild
Health officials in China have published the first details on nearly 45,000 cases of the novel coronavirus that originated there, saying more than 80% have been mild and new ones seem to be falling since early this month, although it's far too soon to tell whether the outbreak has peaked.
Virus conspiracy theory is debunked
A conspiracy theory on how the virus got its start lacks evidence and has been dismissed by scientists. But it has gained an audience with the help of well-connected critics of the Chinese government such as former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. And Sunday, it got its biggest public boost yet. Speaking on Fox News, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., raised the possibility that the virus had originated in a high-security biochemical lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak."

The Golden Valley-based food company told investors Tuesday the remaining company-owned shops are operating under severely restricted hours to abide by guidance from the Chinese government and various health agencies.
More than half of the China’s nearly 1.4 billion citizens are under some form of travel restriction or quarantine mandate. The virus has claimed nearly 1,900 lives in the world’s most populous nation.
“It’s important to note that the safety of our consumers, employees and other stakeholders is our top priority,” said Kofi Bruce, General Mills’ new chief financial officer.
Nestlé owns the Häagen-Dazs brand in the United States and Canada while General Mills owns the brand internationally.
General Mills announced the impact on its China operations at the tail end of an otherwise upbeat presentation Tuesday morning at the Consumer Analyst Group Of New York conference in Boca Raton, Fla.
General Mills reaffirmed its full year guidance of growing organic net sales between 1% and 2%. If that holds, fiscal 2020, which ends in late May, will mark the first in several years where the company achieves real sales growth. General Mills reported a 4% sales decline in fiscal 2017 followed by two years of flat sales.
Many corporations are starting to warn investors that the coronavirus epidemic could negatively impact their bottom line. General Mills stopped short of doing so Tuesday, but said its full-year guidance excluded any potential impact from coronavirus.
“The rapidly evolving situation makes it difficult to quantify the full-year impact of the outbreak at this time,” Bruce said.
He said the company would offer more details on the impact of coronavirus on its fiscal third quarter earnings call in mid-March.
China represents 4% of General Mills’ more than $16.5 billion total annual net sales.
About 40% of China’s sales, or around $264 million, come from its Häagen-Dazs and other food service outlets each year. Bruce said that these stores have higher costs and so a decline in sales there has a more significant impact on its profit relative to the Asia and Latin America business segment’s overall profitability.
“We are continuing to assess the ongoing impact of the outbreak on our Asia business,” he said."
"February 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/infodemic-is-another-coronavirus-threat/567985032/,StarTribune,Infodemic' is another coronavirus threat,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared a ""people's war"" against the coronavirus.
But as Aeschylus, the ancient Greek playwright, apocryphally said, ""In war, truth is the first casualty.""
And so it seems in China, epicenter of the epidemic, where truth and trust are in as short of supply as surgical masks reportedly are.
The ability of international institutions and other governments to rapidly respond to the outbreak was compromised by China's initially opaque response to the virus. The relative reticence of Xi to take the lead made matters worse, which is perhaps why the Chinese president has more publicly re-emerged after his conspicuous absence at the start of the virus crisis.
Beijing recently released a speech Xi made to the normally secretive Politburo Standing Committee in which he claimed that he had ""issued demands about the efforts to prevent and control"" the virus on Jan. 7, weeks before he publicly spoke about the outbreak that would soon break beyond China's borders to become a global health concern. But instead of quelling the controversy the speech has only led to more questions about the alacrity and efficacy of China's response, which is in keeping with Beijing's authoritarian approach.
The party's ""campaign of repression and censorship in this new health crisis is not an anomaly. It is the rule,"" Prachi Vidwans, a Human Rights Foundation research associate told an editorial writer in an e-mail exchange. When the virus emerged, ""the government responded with opacity, hoping to prevent bad news from affecting its approval rating and its economy,"" Vidwans said. Of course, both have happened: Even in an increasingly Orwellian China, dissent — especially after the death of a doctor who was reprimanded for reporting the disease early on — has emerged. And China's economy has been hit — just as others will be, given the nation's outsized economic role. Indeed, Apple, which announced on Monday that the virus would take a bite out of revenue, won't be the last multinational firm hit by the global crisis.
""This is a case where you can see how authoritarianism elsewhere affects you, even if you live in a free and democratic country,"" Vidwans said.
Including America, which should be the global exemplar of transparency.
That task would be difficult in any circumstances. It will be particularly challenging in what the World Health Organization calls an ""infodemic"" — which the WHO describes as ""an overabundance of information — some accurate and some not — that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.""
America's world-class scientific community can combat this infodemic with data-driven conclusions. Everyday people can help, too, by arming themselves with legitimate information and not allowing xenophobia to exacerbate the crisis. And given their legislative and publicity platform, lawmakers have a special responsibility to focus on facts, which is why it is so disappointing that Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, took to Fox News to further the already-debunked theory that the virus was potentially connected to a biosafety lab in Wuhan, China.
Geopolitics are already strained with the new virus, and conspiracy theories will only solidify a drift that may make it even harder to garner Chinese cooperation. Cotton, and others not operating with substantiated facts, should be more responsible.
The U.S. cannot control China's authoritarian tendencies.
It can, however, offer a model of transparency and truth that the world needs now more than ever."

But efficiency improvements and tax-related benefits kept overall profits above expectations in the three-month fiscal period that ended Jan. 24. The company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 beat analysts' consensus estimate by 6 cents and were up from $1.29 during the same period a year ago. While profit grew by 11.6%, organic sales increased just 2.6% at the medical device maker, which is run from headquarters in Minnesota.
Medtronic President Geoff Martha, expected to take over as CEO on April 27, said the company is already making adjustments to improve consistency and smooth out the effects from ""transitory"" events that happen late in the quarter.
""We plan to discuss these and other changes during our investor day [in June], but I want to assure you of one thing — I'm on this,"" Martha said during the quarterly earnings call Tuesday morning. ""And we are taking the appropriate actions to improve consistency and avoid future surprises.""
Medtronic stock closed at $112.66 per share, down 4% on the day.
Unwelcome sales surprises included relatively sluggish revenue from popular aortic heart valves that are implanted via minimally invasive procedures. Sales of these TAVR devices rose 13% during the quarter, while the broader U.S. market galloped ahead more than 30% following a regulatory approval that greatly expanded the potential pool of patients.
Medtronic is training more sales reps to address the problem. At the same time, Medtronic's minimally invasive therapies group suffered a self-inflicted wound during the quarter after its conversion to a new enterprise computer system ran into problems, holding up some products and leading to lost sales.
In addition, sales declined for complex left-ventricular heart pumps called LVADs, for Medtronic's novel biologic drug Infuse, used to fuse vertebrae in the lower back, and for neurostimulation devices that treat chronic pain.
Analysts with CFRA maintained their buy rating on the stock, pinning lower-than-expected quarterly revenue primarily on ""curbed customer spending"" ahead of new product launches in the heart-device and restorative therapies groups.
There was also a question Tuesday about Medtronic's gross margin, which is a measure of the profit margin after accounting for manufacturing and sales costs. Medical devices tend to carry high markups over manufacturing costs, but Medtronic's gross margin has dropped to about 70% in recent months.
""One of the largest pressures that we've had on gross margins is the increase in China tariffs,"" Chief Financial Officer Karen Parkhill said Tuesday. ""And as long as those stay, that will be a continued pressure. … As we introduce new products, that should help gross margin going forward.""
Medtronic said it expects the coronavirus in China to negatively affect fourth-quarter results and plans a later update."

For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the St. Paul-based company said sales rose 2% to $3.8 billion, while net income rose 9% to $430 million, or $1.47, a share with the help of a reduced tax rate.
CEO Douglas Baker told analysts he was pleased with the fiscal year.
Ecolab said it expects new business, price hikes and cost cuts to boost results throughout 2020. It forecast that adjusted earnings will grow 9% to 12% to reach $6.33 to $6.53 a share for the year. That guidance includes a 5 cents a share hit from the effects of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Baker said pension and currency headwinds will reduce full-year results by about 12 cents a share.
“However, we have strong underlying new-business momentum and our innovation pipeline is strong, including our multiple-year digital investments,” he said. Improving sales trends and expanded margins are expected to continue in 2020, he added.
Excluding one-time special gains, charges and discrete tax items, adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter rose 8% to $1.66 a share for the quarter. That was 3 cents shy of analysts’ estimates.
Total fourth-quarter results included a $7 million cost impact from a European health care product recall, $25 million in restructuring costs and impact from pension liabilities.
On the sales side, fourth-quarter revenue rose for Ecolab’s two largest businesses — global industrial and institutional.
Energy-unit sales, however, fell 3%.
In December, Ecolab announced that during the second quarter of 2020 it would spin off its “upstream” oil-drilling chemicals business and merge it with Texas-based Apergy Corp. as part of a complex tax-free deal. Excluding the upstream energy business, which has about $2.3 billion in sales, Ecolab’s fourth-quarter fixed-currency sales rose 3%.
Ecolab’s stock price rose less than 1% Tuesday to close at $207.68 a share."

Economic activity in China has slowed dramatically in the wake of widespread quarantines and stringent limits on travel, and the impact is beginning to reverberate around the globe.
Executives at Ecolab, the St. Paul-based maker of cleaning and sanitizing products, became the first Minnesota company to quantify the virus’ effects so far. They said the company’s 2020 profit will narrow by about 5 cents per share, a bit less than 1%, from the approximately $6.40 a share they expect. That figure could get bigger if work and everyday life in China stays compromised into spring and summer.
“We are not yet able to estimate and forecast the impact for the second quarter through fourth quarter,” Doug Baker, Ecolab’s chief executive, said.
Meanwhile, General Mills, based in Golden Valley, said about half of its Häagen-Dazs ice cream shops in China are closed because of the outbreak but that it was too early to quantify the impact. And Medtronic, which has its corporate office in Fridley, said it expects an impact because 7% of its sales are in China, but that it would know more precisely in coming weeks.
These statements came a day after Apple, the most valuable U.S. company by market capitalization, said it wouldn’t meet its forecast sales of iPhones, which are assembled in China, due to the slower output from its factories there and purchasing by Chinese consumers.
Apple’s warning weighed down stock trading on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrials lost 0.5% and S&P 500 0.3%, with Apple falling 1.8%, and Intel, the world’s leading chipmaker, down 1.7%.
Later Tuesday, David Joy, chief market strategist at Minneapolis-based Ameriprise, wrote in a note to clients that investors in general continue to have faith that coronavirus effects will be short-lived.
“The extent of the economic damage caused by the virus remains unclear,” Joy wrote.
He said some data releases later in the week, including Markit’s survey of manufacturing and service indexes in most developed economies on Friday, will give executives and investors more clues.
More than 150 million people in China, or about 10% of its population, are confined to their homes, and the movements of residents in about half the country are restricted in some form, though they are able to leave. The virus has claimed nearly 2,000 lives in the world’s most populous nation.
During the Lunar New Year, a two-week holiday in China when nearly all factories close, Ecolab kept one of its hand- sanitizer factories partly running. Last week, after the Chinese government extended the holiday in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, Ecolab reopened two other plants.
Demand for hand sanitizer grew, but sales for other Ecolab products softened in China as people avoided hotels, restaurants and offices.
“We are seeing it clearly. Hospitality, food service and travel is way down in China, and hotels are clearly impacted,” Baker said. “And then we have industrial production that has also been curtailed.”
As people stay home in China, General Mills’ chain of 470 ice cream shops curtailed operations. Nearly half are closed with the rest open for short periods, under government orders.
“The safety of our consumers, employees and other stakeholders is our top priority,” Kofi Bruce, General Mills’ chief financial officer, said Tuesday.
Nestlé owns the Häagen-Dazs brand in the United States and Canada, and General Mills owns the brand internationally. In China, General Mills’ ice cream shops are destinations for special occasions. About 40% of General Mills’ sales in China, or around $264 million, come from its Häagen-Dazs and other food service outlets there.
For medical device giant Medtronic, the virus effect in China amounts to manufacturing disruptions and lower demand for its products, since hospitals are performing fewer procedures involving devices.
China represents about 7% of Medtronic’s global revenue, and sales in the country grew 14% in its latest quarter ended Jan. 24. All of Medtronic’s manufacturing operations in China were up and running, CEO Omar Ishrak said.
“Our top concern is the health and well-being of our employees in China and across the globe,” he said Tuesday. “We’re committed to helping the Chinese government and Chinese physicians address this crisis.”
Another medical device maker, Boston Scientific, which has a sizable operation in the Twin Cities, said earlier this month it may lose as much as $40 million in revenue at the start of 2020 because of canceled medical procedures in China and disruptions to its supply chain there."
"February 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/flu-shows-second-act-in-minnesota/568050432/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Hundreds hospitalized as flu surges in Minnesota,"The coronavirus might be grabbing headlines, but seasonal influenza is doing the damage in Minnesota right now.
The latest flu surveillance data from the Minnesota Department of Health showed a surge last week in hospitalizations and patients showing up in clinics with flu-like illnesses — and the second flu-related death of a child this season. The uptick comes as an unusual early spread of a B strain of influenza, historically tougher on children, has given way to an A strain of the virus.
“Influenza A is really picking up steam right now,” said Karen Martin, an epidemiologist with the state Health Department.
More than 640 people were hospitalized due to influenza in the first two weeks of February — the highest two-week tally of the season, according to state flu data released Thursday. The share of patients coming into clinics with flu-like symptoms reached 7.3% last week, the second-highest rate of the season.
The surge in cases comes despite initial estimates released Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that this year’s vaccine has been 45% effective. That is considered average; the effectiveness rate has ranged from 10 to 60% in prior years.
While the flu season so far has been harshest on children — Minnesota already has reported a record 762 outbreaks of flu-like illnesses in schools — the CDC reported that the vaccine has been more effective for that age group.
The effectiveness data suggests the vaccine has cut the number of clinic visits by sick children in half, Martin said.
“It has been a particularly bad year for kids,” she said. “It would have been quite a bit worse if people had not been vaccinated.”
The late-season emergence of A strains of influenza has caused only a slight increase in outbreaks among the most vulnerable adults in long-term care facilities. Martin said the worst seasons in these facilities involved A3 strains, not the A1 strain that is spreading now.
Minnesota has tallied 58 flu-related deaths, including two pediatric deaths, which is below average at this point when compared with prior flu seasons.
Martin said it isn’t too late to get a flu shot, especially given the unpredictability of the current flu season, the first in her experience in which a B strain circulated widely before an A strain.
Last year showed flu can linger, as infections and one death were reported in June 2019."

Even with unanticipated roadblocks, it still could be, especially with newer technologies such as 5G being embedded in phones and smart devices such as doorbells, locks and smartwatches hitting a sweet spot. The long-awaited release of PlayStation and Xbox consoles, which many expect to hit shelves before the holidays, also could provide an uptick in the latter part of the year.
As the only national retailer left devoted to the category, Richfield-based Best Buy is well-positioned to benefit from the potential growth.
But the rosy outlook has become murkier in recent weeks amid the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, the biggest source of consumer electronics in the world. More than half of Best Buy’s products by revenue are produced or assembled in China.
That makes the overall picture much trickier, said UBS analyst Michael Lasser.
“Overall, demand should be healthy,” he wrote in a recent research report. “But, with new mobile and console launches weighted to the back half of the year, there could be a near-term lull. Also, the coronavirus may negatively impact the [consumer electronics] supply chain.”
Apple warned investors last week that it doesn’t expect to meet its revenue projections for the first months of the year as production in China resumes more slowly than anticipated, potentially leading to a temporary shortage of iPhones. Most of Apple’s products are assembled in China, a country that has also become an increasingly important market on the consumer end as well.
Apple’s relationship with China is similar to many American companies, and the ripple effects of the deadly illness that has led to factory and store closures across China is starting to be felt across a swath of industries from car manufacturing to medical devices to luxury brands.
Best Buy has not said anything yet about the effect of the coronavirus on its supply chain or business, but the topic is sure to come up during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. Many analysts say they’re expecting Best Buy to be more conservative with its guidance for the year because of it.
Best Buy no longer has any stores in China. As part of its successful turnaround efforts, the company in 2014 sold its 184-store Five Star chain as it refocused its strategy on North America.
A report by analysts at Wells Fargo earlier this month said further delays in the restart of production in China following the Lunar New Year, when businesses shut down for days, could result in out-of-stock items in U.S. stores as early as mid-April. Best Buy, as well as Walmart, Dollar Tree and Minneapolis-based Target, among others, are at the most risk, the report said, since they rely on more frequent inventory replenishment from China.
At the same time, retailers are better prepared to handle disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak after hustling last year amid President Donald Trump’s trade war to move some production out of China to avoid higher tariffs.
Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told reporters in August that many of its vendors had begun shifting operations out of China to countries such as Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea and Mexico. While about 60% of Best Buy’s business was potentially affected by tariffs on Chinese goods, she said she expected that percentage to drop to 40% by this year because of manufacturers’ migration.
Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, noted that some of the bigger screen TVs that Best Buy sells now come from Mexico. Still, he added that nearly half of Best Buy’s revenue comes from computers and mobile phones, which are both largely assembled in China.
“My guess is that you’re going to see some supply constraints, so I suspect they will warn about the balance of the year,” he said.
Before coronavirus became a major concern, a number of firms and industry groups put out robust forecasts for growth in consumer electronics for the year. The Consumer Technology Association projected 4% growth, noting that smartphone sales were expected to increase this year after dipping last year. The NPD Group, which doesn’t include smartphones or video games in its estimate, called for 5% growth, with products such as wireless headphones, Chromebooks, 65-inch and bigger TVs, smartwatches and smart home devices expected to see double-digit growth.
If that pans out, it would be the best results in years. Last year saw 3% growth, and the year before that 2%, but those followed years of declines, according to NPD’s data.
“But if things are tight in the first half of the year or there’s any kind of production issues [because of coronavirus], that will be a tough number of meet,” acknowledged Stephen Baker, an NPD Group vice president.
Still, he noted that the appetite for the latest gadgets and devices is high right now, with the industry in a robust upgrade cycle, particularly of higher-priced premium products.
“Before, you saw people reluctant to upgrade when they were afraid that the products they bought wouldn’t be future proof,” said Baker. “I think we’re in this cycle right now where people are looking at products out there — 65-inch TVs, thinner computer notebooks — and are really feeling like they meet their needs now and will meet their needs for awhile. The pricing and the products are really attractive. So they’re buying now and are not worrying about what the next generation of products look like.”"
"February 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/schafer-c-h-robinson-leader-sees-ripples-not-big-changes-in-global-trade/568087672/,StarTribune,"C.H. Robinson leader sees ripples, not big changes, in global trade","C.H. Robinson Worldwide might not be well understood even in its hometown.
When Chief Executive Bob Biesterfeld meets people around the Twin Cities, he told me last week, and says where he works, he is often told: “Oh, I’ve seen your trucks.”
No one has seen C.H. Robinson’s trucks. They don’t exist.
But their boxes do, big container boxes that fit on the ships, trains and trucks of other companies.
C.H. Robinson books freight for its thousands of customers, in its boxes or those of other firms. That includes boatloads from China, where efforts to contain an outbreak of a new form of virus has thoroughly disrupted everyday life and the economy.
It hadn’t been a great couple of years for people who manufacture globally even before the coronavirus. Yet Biesterfeld called all this “ripples,” not the kind of tsunami that would cause executives to rethink where they get their products and materials. The basic premise of trade — the whole system gets more efficient and produces more if products get made in the right place — makes as much sense as ever.
C.H. Robinson stands astride global trade like no other company in the Twin Cities. It grew out of its roots as a fruit-and-vegetable broker more than 100 years ago to become the leader in what’s now called third-party logistics.
It blossomed just as the most recent wave of increased globalization swelled. All that term globalization means, by the way, is businesses choosing to work with other businesses on the other side of a national border.
The London-based economic forecasting firm Capital Economics is among those wondering if the latest surge of globalization that began after World War II might be ending. Last year the firm suggested it might not be just a stall in growth, which had shown up in data back to 2010 or so, but the start of a retreat from goods, people and capital easily moving across borders.
That might not be a bad thing, they stressed, if it was happening because better production technology took the pressure off companies to find sites with lower-cost labor or materials. If machines can do the valuable work now, those cost about the same anywhere.
A reversal of globalization would hamper economic growth, though, if it’s driven by new trade barriers to protect politically important industries or just to reflect growing hostility toward other parts of the world.
It’s hard to know right now what’s happening. For the past couple of years, of course, the news has been mostly about escalating trade conflicts.
As U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods increased beginning in the summer of 2018, a lot of activity clearly moved from China to countries like Vietnam in Southeast Asia. U.S. companies were looking for a workaround to the tariff problem, Biesterfeld said.
The disruption brought about by the tariffs was clearly one of the factors in an overall slowdown in manufacturing last year. Biesterfeld mentioned that, in the third quarter of last year, several key indicators to C.H. Robinson all seemed to be slipping at the same time, including ocean port volumes, container traffic on the railroads and the closely watched PMI manufacturing index.
“But as you know, Malaysia and Vietnam, they simply don’t have the infrastructure of China,” Biesterfeld said. “You can’t just literally move China to Vietnam; that’s not going to work.”
“Over the course of the last 12 months, and whether it was with tariffs initially and now culminating with this coronavirus, there’s a lot of conversation with our customers about what they think the appropriate supply chain strategy is,” he continued. “Where production should exist, whether they should have a more balanced portfolio, how do they avoid supply chain disruptions.”
Biesterfeld declined to talk about the impact of the virus outbreak at length. Executives at rival Expeditors International of Washington, last week spoke of “a significant impact” on shipping volume for the first quarter.
Biesterfeld said no customer has said they were even thinking of leaving China due to the disease.
“As we think about our strategy sitting in the middle of this global supply chain, we see customers becoming much more focused on being more global, not less,” he said. “The expectation is ‘I want global supply, I want visibility to it on a global basis, and I want it now.’ ”
That is, there is a place somewhere in the world where people can build what C.H. Robinson’s customers want more efficiently than anywhere else, maybe even including the customer’s own backyard. The pressing task of management is to find those producers and get those products to the doorstep of their own customers as efficiently as possible. And that’s not easy.
Much of what C.H. Robinson does can be thought of as making this whole process more efficient. An example is how the company helps owners of mom-and-pop U.S. trucking firms carry full loads on more of the miles they drive.
“When we talk to our customers — and we talk to them a lot, formal surveys and just conversations — the theme that comes out is that … shippers and manufacturers understand that they need to take advantage of the economic benefits of global production,” he said. “But they’re not sure exactly how to do that,” puzzling over everything from managing customs and trade rules, where to keep inventory or how to keep eyes on every part moving through a long supply chain.
That puzzle just got harder to solve with a disease outbreak in Asia, of course, yet there’s no reason to think the desire to solve it has started to evaporate."
"February 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/nearly-all-minnesota-companies-caught-in-market-selloff/568139602/,StarTribune,Nearly all Minnesota companies caught in stock market sell-off,"Shares in nearly all of Minnesota’s publicly traded companies were swept up Monday in a broad sell-off that was shaped by intensifying fears about the economic impact of the coronavirus.
The number of cases outside China, where the virus originated and has killed the most people, surged over the weekend, particularly in Italy and South Korea. Those two countries, like China, play an outsized role in the global economy.
The S&P 500 stock index fell 3.4%, its biggest drop since a 3.8% plunge in February 2018, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.6% in Monday’s trading, with energy and technology stocks hit hardest. Crude oil prices fell 4% in the U.S. and Europe. Demand for U.S. Treasuries surged, pushing down yields.
For stock investors, the sell-off brought major indexes back to the levels they were at in early December.
“We’re not likely to make any progress higher until we have evidence the spread of the coronavirus is decelerating,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The health care sector was confronted with another potentially game-changing prospect: Bernie Sanders as the Democratic presidential nominee. Sanders handily won the Nevada caucus on Saturday, creating momentum ahead of votes in South Carolina later this week and the 14-state Super Tuesday primary next week. His proposed Medicare for All health care system would abolish private health insurance.
Shares in Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group, the nation’s largest health insurer, fell 7.8% on Monday.
Last week, analysts from Deutsche Bank argued in a research note that Sanders’ ascent in early nomination contests was good for insurers’ stocks, since it boosted chances for the re-election of President Donald Trump. On Sunday, JP Morgan analyst Gary Taylor wrote that the sentiment of health care investors will be “volatile and ephemeral over the next several months.”
“Are the rising odds of a Sanders nomination a negative catalyst for the sector [given his health care views] or a positive catalyst as oddsmakers boost Trump’s re-election changes?” Taylor wrote. “We think most health care investors cite the latter, but actually fear the former.”
Shares of only one other Minnesota company fared worse than UnitedHealth Group: Golden Valley-based CyberOptics Corp., a supplier of semiconductor manufacturing test equipment. Its shares fell 12%, but that followed a run-up last week after a strong results announcement. Its closing price on Monday of $21.97 was only 2% below where it finished a week earlier.
Duluth-based Ikonics Corp., which also supplies equipment used in electronics manufacturing, experienced a 6.8% drop in share value.
Ameriprise Financial, the Minneapolis-based investment advisory and asset manager, saw its shares drop 6.4%.
Minnetonka-based Northern Oil and Gas, an oil and natural gas producer with interests mainly in North Dakota, finished the day down 4.5%.
One of the few gainers in the market was Mendota Heights-based Patterson Cos., which rose 2.9%. BBQ Holdings, parent company of Famous Dave’s, rose 1.7%, helped by news that a bankruptcy judge approved its acquisition of Granite City Food and Brewery, announced earlier this month.
Only 13 stocks on the S&P 500 closed higher Monday. Another of them was Mosaic Co., the former Minnesota-based maker of commercial fertilizers that is now based in Tampa, Fla. Its shares rose 1.1%."
"February 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/is-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic-yet/568153242/,StarTribune,Is the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic yet?,"On Tuesday, Feb. 18, no coronavirus cases had been reported in Iran. On Sunday, the government announced 43 cases and eight deaths. Some 152 cases (and at least three deaths) were confirmed in Italy on Sunday, up from three cases on Thursday. The number of infected people in South Korea jumped to 763 (and six deaths) in just days.
As of Monday, Covid-19 was detected in at least 29 countries. In nations with few or no reported cases so far, particularly in South America and Africa, the absence of evidence shouldn’t be interpreted as evidence of absence. More likely, it reflects lack of testing.
Is the Covid-19 outbreak now a pandemic, whether or not the World Health Organization calls it that yet?
If so, what’s next?
First, let’s get the facts straight about what can and cannot be done.
It’s now clear that the epidemic was never going to be contained. At most, its spread was slowed by the lockdown imposed in China and other countries’ efforts to identify infected people and anyone they might have been in contact with.
Covid-19 seems to spread like influenza, through the air, person to person. Unlike Ebola, SARS and MERS, individuals can transmit this coronavirus before the onset of symptoms or even if they don’t become ill. An infected person appears to spread the disease to an average of 2.6 people. After 10 generations of transmission, with each taking about five or six days, that one initial case has spawned more than 3,500, most with no or mild symptoms, yet probably infectious. The fact that mild cases are difficult to differentiate from colds or the flu only complicates the diagnosis.
In light of the disease’s features, the quarantine of the passengers and crew members on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay in Japan looks like a cruel experiment: While confined, these people were forced to breathe recycled air for two weeks. The measure achieved little except to prove just how effective the virus is at spreading. Trying to stop influenza-like transmission is a bit like trying to stop the wind.
Vaccines are many months away, at the earliest. And based on previous experiences with SARS, MERS and pandemic influenza, there is no reason to believe — as President Donald Trump claimed — that Covid-19 will go away this spring as warmer weather arrives in the Northern Hemisphere. Transmission around the world could continue for months.
The lockdown imposed by the Chinese government in Hubei, the province worst hit by the disease, substantially reduced the number of new cases for a time. But even that has limited benefits. As China tries to return to work, public transportation resumes and citizens start moving about, there will likely be a major rebound in cases. Unless an entire population shelters in place for many months, infectious agents like influenza or this coronavirus will find people to infect.
In other words, a lockdown is mostly a delaying tactic. By distributing cases over time, it can help manage an outbreak — but only if it takes place against the backdrop of a robust health care system. Yet even the best system is too fragile, and a moderate increase in infectious cases, whether from a seasonal flu or Covid-19, can quickly overwhelm resources, in China or the United States.
As chilling as it is to imagine this scenario, what happened in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak, will likely play out elsewhere, too. Hospitals might have to turn away all but the people most seriously ill; their ability to handle their usual load of patients with heart attacks, critical injuries or cancers may be severely compromised.
In a world ill-prepared for a potentially life-threatening, easily transmitted disease like Covid-19, the most effective way to mitigate the pandemic’s impact is to focus on supporting health care systems that already are overburdened.
This is the main reason every country’s top priority should be to protect its health care workers.
The United States and other countries in the Northern Hemisphere already are in the throes of a moderately severe flu season. Their inventories of protective equipment used by doctors, nurses and emergency medical workers — N-95 respirator masks, gloves, eye protection, disposable suits — are running low. These limited supplies must go to health care workers first, rather than the public. This is partly to ensure that hospitals themselves do not become sites where the coronavirus is spread more than it is contained: If infected health care workers die in large numbers, entire societies may be shaken to the point of panic.
Governments should also conduct Covid-19 preparedness drills in local hospitals and expand hospitals’ temporary capacity, for example, by setting up emergency tents in parking lots, as is already happening in some places in the United States. To minimize the strain on overstressed acute-care hospitals, supportive nursing care might have to be provided, in makeshift facilities and patients’ homes, as was done during severe pandemics in the past, such as the Great Influenza of 1918-19.
The manufacturing and distribution chains for drugs and other vital products like needles and syringes must remain open, and that, given the global nature of the industry, requires international cooperation. In keeping with World Health Organization guidelines, coronavirus-stricken countries shouldn’t be walled off the way that the United States and others are trying to do with China at the moment. Otherwise, as the virus spreads, we will be isolating ourselves, too, and will jeopardize our ability to obtain critical resources. Many of the active ingredients in lifesaving generic drugs — the ones that stock hospital crash carts and maintain our daily well-being — come from China and India. If that production is brought to a standstill, many people could die, not directly from Covid-19, but indirectly from a lack of access to those drugs.
Ensuring all of this means facing the hard facts of this unfolding pandemic — and that requires thorough, transparent disclosures to the public. Past experiences, with the anthrax-laced letters in 2001 and the 2014 Ebola outbreak, suggest that people react more rationally and show greater resilience to a full-blown crisis if they are prepared intellectually and emotionally for it.
And yet even those officials and experts who have candidly predicted a pandemic are not saying enough about what to expect and how to prepare. Basic information is still lacking, or isn’t getting through: According to a recent survey, 65% of people in Hong Kong had enough surgical masks for a month or more — this, even though such masks will do little to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
Singapore, which is experiencing an outbreak despite a world-class medical and public health system — 89 cases as of Sunday — is the model to emulate. It is preparing its citizenry for a greater crisis still by providing it with explicit instructions and specific advisories about, for instance, attending large gatherings or sharing residential areas with people under home quarantine.
And what should each of us do, beyond staying informed and washing our hands frequently? Keep calm and rational. It might be worth stocking some reserve of critical medications, for example — but not too much, because hoarding could create shortages.
We, as individuals, can also try to plan for basic contingencies. Companies can cross-train key staff members so that one person’s absence won’t derail the business. Family members and friends should be watchful of one another’s health and welfare, and stand prepared to care for the moderately ill if hospitals become overtaxed.
“Pandemic” isn’t just a technical public health term. It also is — or should be — a rallying cry."
"February 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/straight-talk-on-coronavirus-risks-is-welcome-and-necessary/568216062/,StarTribune,Straight talk on coronavirus risks is welcome and necessary,"As fears mount over coronavirus, perspective is in order. If you're reading this editorial, chances are you've already survived a pandemic, the term for when an epidemic goes global.
In 2009, U.S. health officials detected a new strain of influenza circulating here, one containing a ""unique combination of influenza genes not previously identified in animals or people."" After its rapid worldwide spread, medical experts declared the influenza epidemic a pandemic. From April 2009 until the pandemic's end in April 2010, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there were 60.8 million cases, 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths in the United States.
While health officials have yet to declare coronavirus a pandemic, it's increasingly clear that it's on the verge of being one and that the U.S. must be ready for the pathogen's likely escalation here. Doctors, hospitals, state and local health departments and, most important, the public, need to understand how quickly the coronavirus is spreading and the role that everyone has in combating it. The clarity about coronavirus risks communicated this week by the CDC, the Minnesota Department of Health and infectious-disease specialists such as Minnesota's Mike Osterholm is alarming but appropriate.
This is a virus that can kill and is more easily transmitted than initially thought. That's why the CDC said last week that it was inevitable that the virus would spread within the U.S. and that ""this might be bad.""
That bluntness may have spooked the stock market, but it was necessary. Public health should be paramount, and it is best served by honesty about the challenges that might lie ahead. An informed nation is one that can come together to control this virus, just as it did with the influenza pandemic 11 years ago.
President Donald Trump's tweets this week focusing on economic fallout were not helpful. His defensive attitude during a Wednesday news conference also failed to inspire confidence. Thankfully, Congress is rising to the occasion. Coronavirus, or COVID-19 as it's officially known, spurred hearings this week in the House and Senate. Republicans and Democrats clearly grasp the gravity of the situation and have made it clear that funding to fight this outbreak will be readily available.
On Tuesday, for example, U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., urged administration officials not to ""lowball"" requests for additional dollars. The Star Tribune Editorial Board shares Shelby's concerns and also wishes the request would have come much sooner. The administration is seeking $2.5 billion in emergency spending, some of which involves nonsensically diverting money from other important programs. In comparison, the Obama administration asked Congress for $6.2 billion to rein in a 2014 Ebola outbreak. And this week, Politico reported that one analyst, a former federal emergency preparedness official, said as much as $15 billion may be needed.
Smart questions by lawmakers from both parties have also put a spotlight on readiness. Answers from Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Chad Wolf, the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary, have not been reassuring. Under questioning from a GOP senator, Wolf ""struggled to produce basic facts and projections about the disease,"" according to the Washington Post. Azar has had to revise the number of protective masks the nation has ready in case of an outbreak, suggesting that officials don't have a firm grasp on supplies stockpiled.
The duo's performance indicates a lack of coordination at the federal level, suggesting the need for a ""czar"" to coordinate the response. Trump finally took that suggestion on Wednesday, but should have appointed a medical expert instead of his own vice president.
Congress also needs to follow up to ensure that the administration has management infrastructure in place to handle pandemics. Reports that the Trump administration dismantled the system built to handle the Ebola outbreak are unsettling.
The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has now topped 81,000. Sixty have been confirmed in the United States, most of them returning cruise ship passengers. There is currently no vaccine or treatment other than supportive care. Measures needed to stop the virus' spread may include school and day care closings, employees working at home, and canceling conferences and other meetings.
This will not be easy, which is why straight talk from the CDC and other public health experts is vital right now."
"February 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-senate-bill-would-set-aside-5m-for-coronavirus/568226652/,StarTribune,Minnesota Senate bill would set aside $5 million for coronavirus,"Minnesota Senate Republicans want to immediately set aside state funding in the event that the new corona­virus reaches Minnesota.
Sen. Jerry Relph, R-St. Cloud, is introducing a bill this week to transfer $5 million from the state budget into the Public Health Response Emergency Account, as state officials and health agencies ramp up preparations for the virus, which has spread to at least 37 countries after first appearing in China.
There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in the state, but legislators have been in contact with health officials. This week, DFL Gov. Tim Walz said the state is preparing for “not if, but when” a case comes to Minnesota.
“Health officials from across the state and world have been warning us for some time: It’s only a matter of time before the novel coronavirus hits the United States and, eventually, Minnesota,” Relph said. “While we certainly hope the worst does not happen, we must begin preparing for the worst right now.”
The state is already taking precautions. Some travel restrictions are in place from Delta Air Lines, the main carrier out of the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, and state health care providers are stocking up on supplies such as masks and gowns in case they treat infected patients. State schools are talking to health officials about possible closure plans.
“We’ve always been at the front end of epidemiology. We do a really good job of front-end notification, meaning our health care providers are watching for this,” Walz said.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, has no vaccine or specific medications to combat it.
The Senate bill would transfer any remaining funding back into the state budget if it’s ultimately not needed. But for now, Relph said, it’s better to be safe than sorry.
“We would be wise to heed the warnings of public health officials across the globe,” Relph said. “We’re talking about a serious virus outbreak that’s on the verge of a worldwide pandemic.”"
"February 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/3m-cannot-keep-up-with-demand-for-protective-masks-because-of-coronavirus-outbreak/568207772/,StarTribune,3M cannot keep up with demand for protective masks because of coronavirus outbreak,"3M cannot make protective respiratory masks fast enough as the coronavirus continues to spread.
The Maplewood-based company continues to ramp up production of the masks at plants in China but also other countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America, as well as the United States.
Even so, global demand is still “exceeding supply,” said 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich in an e-mail. “3M expects demand for respirators to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.”
St. Paul-based Ecolab, which provides sanitizing and disinfecting chemicals, said it is selling more disinfectants in China. But even as hand-sanitizing and disinfectant sales rise there, demand for other products is falling, investor-relations head Mike Monahan said last week.
The coronavirus effects will likely decrease Ecolab’s earnings this year by 5 cents a share, even as the higher disinfectant sales in China and perhaps other countries affected by the virus will increase.
Many hotels, restaurants, airlines and cruise ships in China, South Korea, Italy and elsewhere are losing revenue as locals stay home for fear of getting sick.
U.S. manufacturers are waiting to see just how hard the coronavirus will slam business this year as they cope with supply delays, partly staffed factories and thousands of office workers sequestered and working from home.
Effect on supply chains
Minnesota producers with suppliers or factories across China have banned employee travel, set up morale-boosting phone calls to homebound workers, launched factory washdowns and changed supply schedules and routes. All in the hopes of coping with an outbreak that originated in China in December but has since fanned out worldwide, claiming nearly 3,000 lives and making more than 80,000 ill.
The situation has U.S. producers on edge and stuck in “wait-and-see” mode.
“The coronavirus is rapidly slowing the momentum of the global economy and sucking the oxygen out of financial markets,” Bank of the West economist Scott Anderson noted in an e-mail Tuesday.
“A brief period of global economic and financial market optimism [that had occurred] over the past four months is quickly going dormant as the global economic impact of the novel coronavirus comes into greater focus,” he said. “China’s growth rebound is not expected to be realized in 2020.”
China right now is operating at about 50% to 60% capacity, but auto sales and travel in China are down about 90% from a year ago.
“The impacts are just now starting to be felt on global supply chains beyond China’s borders and we think U.S. companies could see more negative fallout in the second quarter than they acknowledge in the first,” Anderson wrote.
3M is closely monitoring and responding to any potential impact to “its broader supply chain,” Ehrlich said, but did not elaborate on where delays are occurring or for which products.
3M generally manufactures goods in China for the Chinese market and not for export from that country, she said. “The majority of our products made in China are sold in China. 3M’s manufacturing model is local for local.”
During a conference call with analysts Jan. 28, 3M CEO Mike Roman said 3M China was initially expected to contribute a “sluggish start” to 3M’s first quarter because of declining automotive build rates. But now, there is also the coronavirus and “it’s kind of changing things as we go,” Roman said.
The $33 billion giant hasn’t yet estimated the virus’ cost, noting that it’s hard to predict, especially as demand surges for its facemasks.
Minneapolis-based Graco, which makes industrial spray and pumping machines, has a factory in Suzhou and its Asian headquarters in Shanghai.
“About 80% of our employees at our production facility in Suzhou have been able to return to the office at this time, while most employees in our Shanghai office are choosing to work from home,” said Graco spokeswoman Charlotte Boyd. In addition, “employees from the Shanghai office who live closer to our Suzhou production facility are working from Suzhou to limit travel between cities.”
While staying home is “isolating” for many workers, she noted that Graco is still following strict health protocols in an effort to keep everyone in good health.
Keeping all operations running smoothly remains a bit of a challenge. “We are seeing some supply-chain slowdown, but we took some early steps to address it. We were able to get some masks to our employees in China, which seemed to be very helpful,” Boyd said.
‘Rapidly evolving situation’
NVent Electric, which is managed from St. Louis Park and makes electrical enclosures and construction fasteners, has 600 workers in China and sources about $25 million of supplies from vendors there.
CEO Beth Wozniak told analysts this month that nVent’s first concern is to help workers affected by the health crisis. Beyond that, a disrupted supply chain is expected to be “a lower impact,” given nVent’s small supply exposure there, she said.
She couldn’t say how the virus might affect nVent long term. “It’s still too early for us to tell. But we’re evaluating it on a daily basis,” Wozniak said.
So is Donaldson Co., which is currently constructing a new plant in Wuxi, China. The Bloomington-based truck and industrial filtration giant generates less than 10% of its $2.8 billion revenue from China. Chinese employees make up less than 10% of Donaldson’s global 14,100-member workforce, said Donaldson spokesman Brad Pogalz.
“The coronavirus outbreak is a rapidly evolving global situation, so we are monitoring it closely. Our top priority has been, and will remain, the safety and health of our employees,” he said.
When possible, employees are working from home and adhering to other travel restrictions while Donaldson provides hard-to-get masks to workers and launches “incremental cleaning cycles at certain facilities,” Pogalz said. He declined to say more, noting that Donaldson releases its quarterly earnings next week.
Pentair filed its annual report Tuesday to regulators.
“Our overall business could be negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, but the significance of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time,” the report said.

While the U.S. government continues efforts such as travel restrictions and quarantines to limit the introduction of the virus into the country, state and federal officials said Tuesday that the disease’s entry into the country is inevitable and that the virus will eventually spread from person to person. So far, the infections identified within the United States have only involved people who traveled to China or their spouses.
“We are preparing … for not if, but when, we end up with a case in Minnesota,” Gov. Tim Walz said.
A key first step is increasing protections for health care workers, who will be urgently needed to treat cases of Covid-19, which so far has no vaccine or specific medications to combat it. The severity of this coronavirus remains unclear, but reports from China showed that it spread quickly among health care providers treating infected patients.

State hospital and health care leaders have been holding weekly teleconferences about their preparedness and supplies of masks, gowns, visors and other disposable items to protect workers.
Some stockpiles created after the 9/11-related bioterrorism scares weren’t maintained, and some supplies stored up after the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic have reached their expiration dates, said Kris Ehresmann, who directs infectious disease programs for the Minnesota Department of Health.
While hospitals are stocking up on supplies, Ehresmann said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also is examining whether some expiration dates were too conservative and whether older protective equipment remains usable.
Individuals can prepare as well, Ehresmann said, by washing hands and practicing other forms of hygiene, and by making sure they have basic supplies at home if they ever need to be confined there.
“We’re not talking about stocking up for Armageddon,” she said, “but just, if you and your family are sick for a while, and can’t get to the store, do you have enough soup or other nonperishable items that you would need?”
The risk to the American public might still be low, but the CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier said it is better to over­prepare for a new virus that isn’t fully understood.
The latest estimates suggest that 80% of infected people suffer mild symptoms, but as many as 2% of infected people die. That would be a higher fatality rate than those seen in recent flu pandemics, said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.
The risks appear greatest for people who are older or have underlying health problems.
The virus also appears more infectious than many seasonal forms of influenza, as health officials estimate that every one infected person will spread the new coronavirus to 2.2 others. Other viruses are far worse, though. One measles patient typically passes that virus to 18 others, for example.
Trying to prevent the spread of such a virus is “like trying basically to stop the wind,” Osterholm said. “We need to really get away from the idea of containment, which can’t happen, and focus more on mitigation.”
Minnesota was not among the first states to receive kits from the CDC to test on its own for coronavirus, because it had neither a federal quarantine site for travelers at risk for infection nor one of the specially designated airports to receive returnees from high-risk areas of China.
Minnesota and other states have since received test kits, but they were found in quality checks to be unusable, Ehresmann said. So for now, the state continues to send samples to the CDC for confirmation.
The state sent three samples to the CDC in January after people who had recently traveled to China became ill, but those tests were negative.
Ehresmann said a fourth sample was just sent Monday, after someone in the state became ill following recent travel to Southeast Asia (although not to China). That person has agreed to remain in voluntary isolation until the test results come back.
Hospitals have learned lessons from 2014 preparations for the potential global spread of Ebola, said Dr. Rahul Koranne, president of the Minnesota Hospital Association. He said suppliers must help by increasing the availability of masks and other disposables, and federal authorities must provide more timely funding.
Local testing also will be crucial to produce more rapid information about a suspect case, he said. “If we don’t hear about the test in a timely fashion, this individual will be in isolation and we will all be worried about who else [he or she has] been exposed to.”
Ehresmann said businesses can help by creating policies that allow sick people to work from home so they don’t spread the virus.
The CDC also is asking individuals and businesses to support other actions that can limit the spread of the virus. Those range from more frequent cleaning of high­-contact surfaces, to the creation of online classes so students can learn at home when their schools have infection risks, to the cancellation of elective surgeries or large public events.
The virus could have only a modest impact in the U.S., or it could end up having a seasonal cycle and wane by summer, but the nation needs to be prepared, Messonnier said."
"February 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/a-leadership-moment-on-coronavirus-was-no-other-way-to-put-it-trumped/568248472/?refresh=true,StarTribune,A leadership moment on coronavirus was — no other way to put it — Trumped,"Believe it or not, I was all ready to praise Donald Trump this time. I really thought when he announced a news conference for Wednesday evening that he would manage to stick to a reasonable script, and there were very promising rumors that he was prepared to make an excellent choice for a new coronavirus czar.
Why? Because so much was on the line for Trump, and what he had to do was so easy. And while he hasn’t done it often, and I didn’t expect it to last much beyond the initial statement, he has at times managed to read a reasonable speech as written. Surely with the markets in turmoil, and the nation poised on the edge of panic, it would be obvious even to him that this was not the time for airing his grievances, repeating his usual insults, and rambling on like some leader of a banana republic who long since lost touch with reality.
Well, if you watched Trump’s news conference, you know I was dead wrong.
Yes, he used his usual juvenile nicknames and petty insults for the Democrats he’s going to have to work with. Yes, he blamed the stock market drop on Monday and Tuesday on — wait for it — the Democratic debate Tuesday night. Yes, he repeatedly praised himself for solving the problem (setting up a potential “Mission Accomplished” moment in the likely event the pandemic spreads in the U.S.) and had administration officials praise him as well. All entirely inappropriate and counterproductive.
But it was worse than that. He was at times barely coherent even for someone who knew what he was trying to say. I can’t imagine what it was like for the bulk of the nation, folks who only sometimes pay attention to politics but might have tuned in because they want to be reassured that the government is on top of the problem. He must have been almost completely incomprehensible to them, rambling on about how he had recently discovered that the flu can kill lots of people and referring in a totally oblique way to the budget requests he had made to Congress and their reaction. He occasionally said something that sort of made sense, but mostly? Not. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel’s reaction was what I thought: “I found most of what he said incoherent.”
At no time over the course of the news conference did Trump supply evidence that he had any idea what he was talking about.
As for the substance? What Trump needed to do was to bring in someone in the White House to be in charge. Asking Vice President Mike Pence to do it wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t really a very good choice, either. I’m not very worried about Pence personally; a lot of liberals were taking shots at Pence for his poor record on public health when he was governor of Indiana, but what’s important here are political and bureaucratic skills, not subject matter expertise. Pence should have the skill set for the job.
So what’s the problem? First, I’m not thrilled with having a vice president lead the charge. For one thing, Pence has other responsibilities, so he won’t be the full-time coordinator that’s really needed. But the real problem is having a virus czar who can’t be fired and can’t credibly threaten to resign — or even to be seen having any separation between himself and the president at all. (That’s not really a Trump-specific issue; it’s inherent in the job of the vice presidency). That weakens Trump, and it also weakens Pence as czar. Someone brought in specifically for this job could have been given more authority and would have had a better chance to successfully steamroll the bureaucracy as needed.
Even worse was how Trump talked about him. Trump first buried the announcement at the end of his rambling opening statement. He also at one point said that HHS Secretary Alex Azar will still be leading the task force on the coronavirus. Then when asked he denied that Pence was a “czar” — an informal title, but one that connotes authority and the full backing of the president. And then he said everyone would report to Pence … but “they’ll also be reporting in some cases to both. I’ll be going to meetings quite a bit, depending on what they want to do, what message they want to get out.” In other words, Trump undercut Pence and muddled the lines of authority right in the announcement of Pence’s new responsibilities.
The reason someone is needed in the job is to break down the bureaucracy and coordinate the actions across agencies. For it to work, the czar (or whatever) needs full, clear, and consistent backing from the president, something that’s not in Trump’s nature to provide. But I really did think he could at least have pretended to do so in the original announcement. Nope.
In other words, Trump is still making the situation as risky for himself as possible — and risking real policy failure in responding to real danger to public health."

CEO Corie Barry said Thursday it’s still a fluid situation and hard to quantify the full size of the effect of the deadly illness on the business. Still, executives of the Richfield-based retailer factored it into their guidance for the year with an expectation for depressed sales in the first half of the year that they don’t expect to fully make up later in the year.
As a result, Best Buy issued a muted, but still positive, forecast for the coming year calling for flat to 2% growth in comparable sales.
“We are seeing some areas where we’re starting to see less stock available,” Barry told reporters after Best Buy reported stronger-than-expected sales and profits during the holidays. She did not specify which products are already being affected."

DFL Gov. Tim Walz and Republican and Democratic lawmakers have offered competing priorities for the expected surplus, which was up slightly from the previous estimate of $1.3 billion in November. Walz advised restraint Thursday on any new tax cut or spending proposals.
“I’m going to urge caution here,” Walz said, adding that budget numbers show just a small improvement in the overall budget picture. “Especially where we see yellow flashing lights in an economy … There were already reasons to be cautious.” The new forecast does not show a dramatic change in the state’s financial trajectory since the Legislature passed a $48 billion two-year budget last year. However, the $181 million increase in the projected budget surplus could alter the contours of lawmakers’ supplemental budget plans this year.
One of Walz’s top priorities is ensuring that a rainy-day fund is flush in preparation for a predicted economic downturn. Last session he and the Legislature agreed to withdraw $491 million from Minnesota budget reserves as they worked to reach a deal on the budget. The governor said he would like to return that amount to the reserves, which are currently at nearly $2.4 billion. Walz also said he will prioritize spending on education, farmer safety, the depleted disaster aid fund, insulin access and a coronavirus response.
“We do believe it’s wise for Minnesota to have a rainy-day fund so if there’s an economic downturn we’re ready for it, but there are also some other priorities we want to weigh out,” said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-Nisswa.
For Senate Republicans, Thursday’s increased revenue estimate bolstered their argument for a tax-cut package. Pieces of their proposed $1 billion plan include eliminating the state tax on Social Security income, reducing the lowest income tax rate and fully conforming with federal tax law on business expenses.
Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, offered a sharp rebuke to the GOP tax plan. “We’re at a good point now, but we shouldn’t waste it with reckless tax bills,” she said.
But House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said any agreement on how to use the $1.5 billion surplus will need support from both Democrats and Republicans. The DFL majority in the House is looking to use $500 million of the surplus to support young learners. That would include expanding early learning scholarships and the state’s child care assistance program.
The Legislature is also trying to reach a deal this session on a bonding bill to authorize state borrowing for public construction projects.
“It’s also really important, with the potential of a downturn in the future, that we invest big in the bonding bill,” Hortman said.
Hortman and Walz both have argued that the state should take advantage of the strong economy and low interest rates as they seek to finance long-term bonds. Walz has proposed a $2 billion general obligation bonding bill; House Democrats have suggested they were open to $3.5 billion, far above the figure Republicans want.
“We’re not setting a hard and fast limit on what [the number] should be,” said House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown. “Is there a chance we could go above $1 billion? There’s a chance we could. Is there a chance we could go above $2 billion? Probably not.”
Minnesota Management and Budget officials said the higher surplus estimate came from a combination of increased corporate tax revenue and decreases in education spending as growth in the state’s student population was lower than anticipated.
Despite the larger surplus, Budget Commissioner Myron Frans warned that budget estimates don’t account for inflation, which is estimated to grow by $1.1 billion over 2022-23. Some House members have suggested factoring inflation into future forecasts.
Officials also highlighted the state’s employment picture, which shows a greater number of job openings in the state than there are job seekers. As employment growth slows and wages accelerate moderately, workers’ incomes are predicted to grow by roughly 4% each year through 2023.
While national economic growth is stable — continuing the longest expansion in U.S. history — a slowdown is expected late next year, Thursday’s report states. And state officials warned of the risk from coronavirus.
The new revenue figures do not fully account for the potential financial impact of the disease, officials said. They relied on data released three weeks ago by the consulting firm IHS Markit. Since then, the virus has spread further across the globe and driven down stocks. Walz and federal officials have said it’s inevitable that it will spread within the U.S.
“Every day brings new understanding of the public health effects,” state economist Laura Kalambokidis said. “If the impact of the outbreak becomes more prolonged or widespread than it appeared at the time IHS constructed their February outlook, U.S. economic growth could be slower than forecast.”"
"February 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-readies-public-to-self-inoculate-against-coronavirus/568254432/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Minnesota officials urge public to prepare for arrival of new coronavirus,"Minnesota might not have a confirmed case of a novel coronavirus infection today — or even in the days or weeks to come — but state health officials said Thursday that now is the time for people to prepare for the threat.
While state officials dust off pandemic plans, in case the new coronavirus that emerged in China becomes widespread here, they encouraged people to gradually stock up on supplies so they can stay home if sick, and to follow the tried-and-true advice of washing hands, covering coughs, and keeping their hands off their eyes, noses and mouths.
“We’re now entering a phase in which it does matter how households, neighborhoods, community groups and even businesses … prepare,” said Jan Malcolm, commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Health.
Enhanced preparation comes even as the World Health Organization has reported signs that the outbreak has peaked in China, where the number of newly detected cases has been declining since Feb. 2. Monday was the first day when the number of new cases of COVID-19, the name for the sickness caused by this virus, was higher in other countries than in China.
The infectiousness and the global spread of the virus have nonetheless prompted Minnesota and U.S. health care leaders to recommend precautions, especially now that the U.S. has confirmed the first case in California in which an infected person had no recent travel history in China or contact with an infected person who had been in China.
“We must anticipate that one or more cases of COVID-19 will be confirmed in Minnesota in the weeks to come,” Malcolm said.
The latest estimates suggest that one person infected with the novel coronavirus will spread it on average to 2.2 others — suggesting that the virus is more infectious than most seasonal influenza strains but less infectious than other viruses such as measles.
One large study out of China estimated a fatality rate of 2% — but a rate of 8% for older people who appear more susceptible to the virus, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist.
“We do worry about the impact that it is going to have on our elderly and people who do have medical conditions,” said Lynfield, but she cautioned that the severity of the virus might be different in the U.S. given that the country has more time to prepare and a different level of health care resources.
“We need to see how things unfold,” she said.
Coronaviruses are somewhat common, and they are responsible for as many as one-third of colds in the U.S. The new version has raised concerns ever since it was identified in a fish market in Wuhan, China, in December, because nobody has immunity to protect themselves from it.
The U.S. government issued its first quarantine orders in 50 years, trying to prevent the virus from entering the country by evacuating Americans from Wuhan and then keeping them on U.S. military bases for two weeks until it was clear they were symptom-free. That included a Minneapolis man who returned home last week.
Other travelers from China were routed through 11 airports and ports where they could be screened and quarantined if they appeared to be sick or at risk of infection.
Minnesota could see similar measures if the virus emerges here, at least while health officials still have a primary goal of containing the spread of the outbreak. Individual schools could be temporarily closed, for example, if they had students who proved to be infected, said Kris Ehresmann, the state health department’s infectious disease director.
“We would evaluate all of those [strategies] in light of the particular situation,” she said. “Those may be tools that we use, but there also does come a point in an outbreak when the disease spread is such that those are no longer useful tools.”
Given the possibility of disruptions at work or school, Ehresmann asked Minnesotans to make backup plans if they had to work from home or go without child care for a short period of time. She also encouraged people to “gradually” build up their supplies of nonperishable foods, medications and anything else they would need if they were required because of an infection, or risk of infection, to be quarantined at home for two weeks.
One Minnesotan who suffered a flu-like illness and recently traveled to Southeast Asia is voluntarily staying at home until federal test results determine whether the illness is due to the corona­virus. Three prior tests of other suspect cases in Minnesota all turned up negative.
Ehresmann said there is no recommendation for the general public to wear facemasks. Concerns right now center on maintaining enough such personal protective equipment to keep health care workers infection-free and on the job during an outbreak.
People can take precautions, she added, by not touching their eyes, nose or mouth in a way that could cause infection."
"February 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/despite-projected-surplus-caution-is-advised-at-the-capitol/568306182/,StarTribune,"Despite projected surplus, caution is advised at the Capitol","Minnesota has the good fortune, once again, to have a projected surplus in its latest economic forecast. But with that projection comes cautionary notes.
First, it’s not really $1.5 billion. By law, the state counts inflation in its revenue projections, but not in its spending projections. This is handy for politicians on both sides, who can claim the “surplus” allows for greater spending or greater tax cuts, take your ideological pick. But it ignores the reality of inflation — a little over $1 billion. Much of that is tied to the wages of the public employees who make this state run, along with rising costs of needed goods. Unless the state is willing to freeze wages or forgo other expenses, it cannot provide the same services for the same cost.
Second, some of that $1.5 billion is already spoken for. To break last year’s legislative stalemate, Gov. Tim Walz, House DFLers and Senate Republicans tapped the budget reserve for $491 million to broach differences. That money should be restored as a hedge against uncertain times ahead. When a downturn hits, Commissioner Myron Frans told an editorial writer, “revenue drops very, very quickly. Meanwhile, demand for services goes up.”
Mindful of that, Walz said of the forecast, “I’m going to urge caution here ... especially where we see yellow flashing lights in an economy.”
One of those flashing yellow lights is the fast-moving coronavirus. It has not hit Minnesota, and so is not accounted for in the forecast, but few officials doubt it is coming.
There are a few smart things lawmakers can do. Refilling — and even adding to — the state’s disaster relief fund should be a priority. Extreme weather events are bleeding resources dry and mounting all the time. The recent spate of grain bin deaths speaks to the need for helping farmers with safety equipment that can save lives. Legislators would also be wise to add to a public health response contingency fund, first created in 2017, that now may prove critical in the state’s ability to mobilize quickly in the face of an outbreak. The fund holds less than $5 million, which could go quickly in an emergency.
Frans also noted that the state must respond to a recent report from the state Office of Legislative Auditor on staffing shortages and other problems that are compromising prison safety.
Massive givebacks such as the Republican proposal to eliminate Social Security benefits from taxation should be avoided. That alone would cost close to $1 billion in the coming two-year budget period and only increase with the state’s growing number of retirees. It is a discussion worth having, but best left for next year’s budget-making session. Similar caution should be exercised with DFL proposals to increase child-care funding and other ongoing costs. Permanent expenses should have permanent funding sources identified.
Minnesota should, however, leave room for a sizable bonding bill. The state has many infrastructure improvements to make and repairs to catch up on, as well as worthy projects that can become catalysts for future growth.
“I know I sound like a broken record, but the key thing is not to overspend,” Frans said."

More than 60 students and staff were informed this week that officials decided to cancel the remainder of the spring semester of the St. John Vianney/Catholic Studies program and close the university's Bernardi campus. Nobody has been infected, but the university wanted them to return home because of increasing travel restrictions in Italy.
The students won't be quarantined when they return to Minnesota, said Madonna McDermott, executive director for the university's Center for Well-Being. Seven of the school's other students studying in Italy have been given the option to return home, she said. More than 100 St. Thomas students study abroad, but no others are in countries where the virus has been confirmed, such as South Korea, Japan and China.
""We had lots of folks around the table and spent several weeks making this decision,"" McDermott said. ""We want to make sure they can come home safe.""
Medical information was part of that decision, but also how rapidly the situation is changing in Italy and how it is affecting the students' ability to travel around the country as part of their education, she said.
The university will assist all students currently enrolled in the program to return to the United States and has made arrangements for them to complete their classes online. The program in Rome has a fall semester, but officials have not decided whether it will go forward.
Other Minnesota universities are monitoring students studying overseas. Macalester College said it has a few students admitted to programs in South Korea and China. They either have returned home or canceled their trips. Macalester also has many students from China, but they have not returned home during winter break.
The University of Minnesota has suspended all student education and study abroad programs in South Korea for the spring 2020 semester due to increased virus cases and concerns raised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department, said university spokesman Jake Ricker. Programs to China were suspended in January because of similar concerns.

"February 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-officials-will-have-ability-to-test-for-coronavirus-by-next-week/568294812/,StarTribune,Minnesota officials will have ability to test for coronavirus by next week,"Minnesota’s public health lab will be able to test for the virus causing the global COVID-2019 outbreak by next week — using the same kit that had been deemed faulty earlier this month.
While local testing hasn’t been urgently needed so far in Minnesota, where doctors have encountered only four patients whose illnesses and travels to Southeast Asia made them infection risks, state health officials said that the capability will be important if the novel coronavirus spreads in the U.S. as expected.
“We need to have the ability to assess additional people who may be infected but are not known to be at high risk,” said Joanne Bartkus, director of the state public health lab. “This will enable us to figure out if the virus is spreading silently and to be able to isolate infected persons to help us prevent transmission.”
Health officials in several states found problems with test kits they received this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Two components of the kit appeared to work properly, but a third did not.
Further federal testing proved that the two functional components were enough to accurately determine whether someone was infected with the novel coronavirus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December and has spread worldwide since then, said the CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier.
“The third component … can be excluded from testing without affecting accuracy,” she said Friday.
Delays in designing and validating the test have caused frustration in places where cases have already been detected or where officials believe testing is appropriate.
Until Thursday, only 15 cases had been detected by testing in the U.S. so far — and all but one involved people who had recently traveled to China or had close contact with those travelers, according to the latest CDC data. But that one case was troubling, because it involved a woman in northern California with no known contact with anyone who traveled to China — meaning that the virus could be spreading from person to person in the U.S. now. And then Friday, California officials reported a second such case and Oregon reported its own first case involving a teacher without any known risk factors.
“You don’t know what you don’t know unless you’re testing,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday, adding that the few hundred testing kits in the state are “simply inadequate to do justice to the kind of testing that is required to address this issue head on.”
Others have raised concerns that the CDC has been too slow to expand the definition of who should be tested. The federal standard for weeks was to test people with flu-like illnesses who had recently traveled to Wuhan or had close contact with such travelers.
China continues to report the most cases — the latest count being roughly 78,000 cases and nearly 2,700 deaths. However, the virus has now been detected in some 60 countries, according to the World Health Organization.
In reaction, the CDC on Thursday expanded its guidance for testing to include people who have unexplained severe respiratory symptoms and who have recently traveled to Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea.
“It’s long overdue that [testing criteria] be broadened,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He added that “travel history will become less important as we have community spread in countries around the world.”
One challenge is that testing is occurring amid the winter influenza season.
“Fever and bad cough are pretty broad parameters, especially during flu season,” Messonnier said.
Those positive test results do not include the 47 Americans with COVID-19 who were repatriated into the U.S. after being infected at outbreak sites in Wuhan and aboard a Diamond Princess cruise in Southeast Asia.
All samples sent from Minnesota to the CDC have tested negative, including a fourth sample sent Monday.
Bartkus said Minnesota will conduct its own testing after she verifies the effectiveness of the original kit the state received and a new kit that contains only the two effective components.
Positive state tests will still be confirmed by the CDC. However, Messonnier said states will be able to declare “presumptive” cases and take action to isolate patients and prevent them from infecting others while awaiting the CDC’s confirmation.
Health officials are concerned because this coronavirus is fairly infectious, and because no one is immune to it. Initial reports in China suggested a 2% fatality rate, which is far worse than the death rates in most flu seasons, but a study released Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine found deaths in 1.4% of infected people."

“Clearly this week markets were trading on emotion,” Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer for Abbot Downing in Minneapolis, said Friday. “Today, the only emotion it is trading on is fear.”
For the fifth day in a row, stock prices swung lower and major indexes lost 12% in value as investors tried to assess the effect of the spread of coronavirus.
Market sentiment shifted from “FOMO to FOCO,” the fear of missing out on a bull market to the fear of coronavirus outbreak, said Craig Johnson, technical market strategist for Minneapolis-based Piper Sandler Cos.
Schleif said she was surprised how quickly investors dropped their focus on fundamentals of corporate performance and valuation.
“When you get complacent about things, your time horizon goes way out into the future and you continue to project good times,” she said. “When fear creeps in, your future thinking is 30 seconds from now.”
Professional investors have been able to create models of other external events — like government shutdowns, worker strikes and Brexit votes — that drove other recent, but smaller, downturns in the markets.
Those events had V-shaped trajectories, or quick dips followed by quick recoveries, Johnson said.
But he said he wonders if this week’s disruption will produce a U-shaped curve, meaning recovery will take longer.
He still thinks it’s possible for stocks to end 2020 slightly higher than they did 2019, even reaching his forecast for the S&P 500 index to finish the year around 3,600. That would require a 22% climb from Friday’s close of 2,954.
“It looks like to me that we can still achieve 3,600 by year-end,” Johnson said. “We are just going to have to be a bit more tactical and nimble to get there, and I’m not sure that this sell-off that we have now has fully run its course as of yet.”
For Johnson and other investment professionals, though, a one-week sell-off — even one as large as this week’s — is not usually enough to re-evaluate your long-term perspective.
“If you are a long-term investor looking to invest for your retirement — 10, 15, 20 years out — you probably don’t care. You should probably ignore the noise. If you are a trader, obviously you care,” Johnson said.
Goldman Sachs said its analysts now expect no corporate earnings growth in 2020. Bank of America lowered its estimate for global GDP growth because of the coronavirus.
So it does have some investment professionals advising a bit more than hold the course.
“It is important for investors to realize the increased risk that now permeates the stock market. It is equally important to recognize that this panic is doing what panics do (and it has done so very quickly): gut-check overly positive sentiment; lower competitive yields; and significantly cheapen the valuation of stocks,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, wrote in a note to investors Friday.
Schleif had been advising clients with immediate cash needs to rebalance their portfolios and take some money off the table in the back half of 2019 and at the start of the year. On Friday, she said that investors who did that and have some cash to deploy may want to tiptoe back into the market.
She cautioned the market may not have bottomed out yet, though stocks rallied in the closing minutes of trading Friday.
“Hopefully the emotional flooding has ceased and a calm weekend re-examining risk reward will tee up a better next week,” Schleif wrote in an e-mail after the market closed.
Biff Robillard, president of Bannerstone Capital Management in Wayzata, has been in the investment business for more than 40 years, but before that he studied biochemistry. So he has been particularly interested in how this viral outbreak has been playing out in the markets, especially in a world that is much more advanced from a global health and communications perspective than it was during previous viral outbreaks.
“A stock market that is up a lot is vulnerable to two things. I think of it as either an endogenous threat or an exogenous threat. This is an exogenous event,” Robillard said.
Right now, he categorizes the novel coronavirus as an external event that will have a shorter time frame. He generally gets more concerned about internal factors that can reshape markets.
“I fear endogenous financial market collapse more than exogenous things,” he said. “Experience has taught me that exogenous events get handled differently by the market.”
The coronavirus could develop from an exogenous event to an endogenous one if it results in a longer-term global economic slowdown, but right now he doesn’t see it that way.
“There is only one end of the world, and this probably isn’t it,” Robillard said."

Investors are trying to gauge whether the virus will be contained and when. They are wondering how big the economic fallout from the virus will be, especially in China. The earnings of multinational corporations with their vast global supply chains and far-flung business units are at risk to measures taken to stem the spread of the virus.
That said, the U.S. economy is remarkably resilient. The stock market has also repeatedly shrugged off bad news. Odds are central bankers will ease policy to offset any worrisome signs of economic weakness, another reason Wall Street commentary seems geared toward recommending investors buy on the dip.
The problem with buy-on-the-dip mentality is the strategy works until it no longer does. The optimists will be right until they aren’t. No one knows how wide the infection will spread or how big or small the economic reverberations will be in coming weeks.
Instead of trying to time the markets at times like these, focus on what you can control: lowering your household’s financial risk. Here are two examples:
First, it’s a reasonable guess that many households are carrying too much debt. American households are paying for nearly $14 trillion in debt, a record level according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The increase has been led by mortgages, but auto, credit card and student loan debts are also up. A classic risk reduction strategy is to start directing more cash into paying down debts, with a priority on credit cards, home equity and auto loans.
Second, getting laid off at any age is tough, but if you are nearing the retirement years the risks associated with losing a job are higher. Older unemployed workers are more likely to join the ranks of the long-term unemployed. When they land a job, it typically pays less than their previous position.
One risk-reduction idea is to practice looking for a job without actually applying. You will learn what employers are looking for in their job postings with this exercise. More important, nurture your network of colleagues, former workmates and acquaintances. Job referrals mostly come through personal networks.
Figuring out where your household is most financially vulnerable and taking steps to reduce risk is smart personal finance. Let the pros figure out proper valuations for stocks and bonds in an unfolding COVID-19 environment."

Were you hoping for a two-day break from the relentless churn of presidential politics? Too bad! South Carolinians are voting in their Democratic primary as you read this: Here's all the latest from the AP. 
Joe Biden is today's main storyline in South Carolina, where his recent rise in polls is setting him up for what could be the start of a comeback — or a last stand. Even a surprisingly strong second by Bernie Sanders in the Palmetto State would probably be seen as hurting Biden's bid to get back into contention nationally. 
Then there's Amy Klobuchar, who bugged out of South Carolina earlier than most of her better-polling rivals in favor of a mad dash across various Super Tuesday states. Here's my last dispatch from South Carolina, where Klobuchar looks to be headed for another sixth-place finish. 
I've not seen any Super Tuesday polls suggesting Klobuchar's in much better shape than South Carolina anywhere except Minnesota. If you have, email them to me: patrick.condon@startribune.com.
Saturday brings Klobuchar to events in Knoxville, Tenn.; Richmond and Norfolk, Va.; and Charlotte, N.C. She held a fundraiser at a hotel in Nashville last night; according to the pool report, former Gov. Phil Bredesen and Nashville Mayor John Cooper were in attendance. 
Klobuchar also made sort of an ... edgy joke at the end. From the pool report:
During her closing, Klobuchar said, ""I'm the granddaughter of an iron ore miner, the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman — "" but she started coughing for a few seconds.
She tried to talk again but coughed. 
""I do not have coronavirus,"" Klobuchar said making audience members laugh. ""Way to really bring down my numbers!""
Klobuchar restarted the line and was able to finish it without coughing.
Local Archbishop Bernard Hebda tells his priests to abstain from voting in the Super Tuesday primary, reports Briana Bierschbach. At issue is the lack of privacy around voter preferences, with party ballot choices transmitted to the state's major parties. ""It could be seen as 'partisan' political activity to align oneself with a party and to vote in its primary, which the Church generally discourages clergy from doing for evangelical reasons, more so than tax ones,"" read Hebda's letter to clergy.

“As the president said, we have more than 40 million masks available today,” Pence said at a news conference in which he appeared with President Donald Trump and health officials. “We’ve contracted now with 3M to — 35 million more masks per month will be produced, and we’re also going to be working with other manufacturers.”
It’s unclear whether he was suggesting that 3M will be making 35 million more masks a month, or whether 3M and other companies would be doing so.
Jennifer Ehrlich, a 3M communications manager said in an e-mail late Saturday that any information about government contracts for respirators would have to come from the Office of the Vice President.
However, Ehrlich added, “Just to clarify, we are not yet under contract for the volume mentioned today. However, we are preparing to respond to the U.S. administration’s request for a proposal for respirators. 3M continues to maximize production at its manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and around the world for all types of N95 respirators.”
The N95 respirator 3M makes can block the coronavirus from moving from an infected person into the air. They are not recommended for use by people who are not infected as a means of blocking the virus.
“The average American does not need to go out and buy a mask,” Pence said. He said they should be used only by those infected and by health care workers exposed to them."
"March 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/delta-halting-nyc-milan-service-in-wake-of-coronavirus-outbreak/568372562/,StarTribune,Delta halting NYC-Milan service in wake of coronavirus outbreak,"Delta, the dominant airline in the Twin Cities, said Sunday it will suspend service between the U.S. and Milan in Italy for the next two months in response to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus in Italy.
In making the announcement, Atlanta-based Delta said ""it remains in constant contact with the foremost communicable disease experts"" with the federal Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization and local officials ""to respond to the coronavirus as well as ensure training, policies, procedures and cabin cleaning and disinfection measures meet and exceed guidelines.""
The service disruption involves flights connecting John F. Kennedy Airport in New York and Milan Malpensa Airport. The last eastbound flight will be on Monday, with the final westbound flight taking off on Tuesday.
Delta said it intends to resume the service in each direction on May 1 and May 2, however, ""the airline will continue to monitor the situation closely and may make additional adjustments as the situation continues to evolve.""
In an earlier response to the virus in Italy, Delta extended the travel waiver for flights to three cities — Milan, Venice and Bologna — as the outbreak spreads rapidly there. The move reflected its partnership with Air France, which offers Delta passengers connecting service throughout Europe.
Last week, Delta said suspended nonstop flights connecting the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) to Seoul for two months as global air travel continues to slow with the spread of the coronavirus.
The last flight before suspension departed MSP for Seoul's Incheon International Airport was Friday, with the last return flight leaving Saturday from Seoul for the Twin Cities.
In late January, the airline suspended through April all its flights to Beijing and Shanghai."
"March 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/a-coronavirus-case-in-a-minnesota-school-wouldn-t-automatically-mean-closings/568381302/,StarTribune,A coronavirus case in a Minnesota school wouldn't automatically mean closings,"Minnesota schools are busy drafting response plans should the coronavirus hit classrooms here in the wake of warnings from national health officials that a U.S. outbreak is inevitable.
The virus continues to spread in Iran, Italy and South Korea. Officials in Japan last week ordered all schools closed until April. Closer to home, U.S. officials recently announced two schools in Oregon and Washington linked to coronavirus cases will shut down for several days and undergo a thorough cleaning.
But Minnesota health officials said a confirmed case here won’t automatically trigger school closures. Until the coronavirus, or COVID-19, is confirmed here, it’s unclear what actions schools will take.
“We really haven’t had a pandemic before,” said Jolene Goldade, a spokeswoman for Hopkins Public Schools. “I can’t think of a situation where we had to close for [something] health-related.”
Closing schools — especially for months — would be a last resort, school officials say, but it’s also something weighing heavily on their minds as the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) shifts its emphasis from containment to community mitigation.
“It’s very likely that we will see cases in Minnesota,” said Kris Ehresmann, MDH director of infectious disease. “If you can’t keep it out, then you want to slow it down.”
Community mitigation comes into play, along with isolation and quarantine, when there’s evidence of widespread global transmission, like we’re seeing now, Ehresmann said. Mitigation could include canceling large gatherings, working from home or closing school.
Ehresmann said MDH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are warning communities that an outbreak will require everyone’s attention.
“We really need the whole community to be part of a successful response. Whenever school closure is mentioned it’s a red flag,” she said. “We want people to be aware that increasing spread and transmission means their daily lives can be impacted — including school. We don’t want to predetermine what that will be, but we want it on people’s radar screens.”
Even so, Ehresmann says parents shouldn’t necessarily expect classes to be canceled. During a widespread swine flu outbreak in Minnesota a decade ago, she said, only Cold Spring schools closed.
School officials say they’ve learned some lessons from the swine flu and 2017 measles outbreaks.
“Unfortunately, this isn’t our first rodeo in Minneapolis Public Schools,” said spokesman Dirk Tedmon. “This is something we’re familiar with. We have protocols in place.”
Cynthia Hiltz, a licensed school nurse and health service coordinator for Anoka-Hennepin Schools, said last week MDH called school nurses to go over recommendations in a rapidly changing plan. Mostly, precautions mirror those for influenza: cover your cough, wash your hands, stay home if you’re sick.
Some districts, such as Rochester, St. Paul and Mounds View, are sharing those protocols and updates in e-mails to parents, while Eastern Carver County, Anoka-Hennepin, Prior Lake-Savage Area and South Washington County districts are holding off to avoid causing panic.
“We don’t want to raise the alarm for something that is not yet a reality in our state,” said Pepe Barton, a spokesman for the South Washington County district.
Rochester Public Schools said they are continually coordinating with Olmsted County Public Health Services to keep up with the latest information. District spokeswoman Heather Nessler said in a statement that Rochester has a strong network with Mayo Clinic and health services to “assure we are working together to prepare, plan, and respond in the best way possible for the health and safety of our community.”
“For now, it is business as usual,” Nessler said.
But as the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow, MDH is ramping up outreach efforts and talking about “social distancing” and “non-pharmaceutical intervention” with businesses and schools.
“With a novel disease like that, we don’t have a vaccine available, we don’t have antivirals that are specific for this, and so we don’t have some of the tools in our toolbox like we have with others,” Ehresmann said.
This week, MDH is talking with schools about ways to minimize disruptions and avoid unintended consequences if classes are canceled. “For a number of children, school is a key source of nutrition,” Ehresmann said.
She said school nurses are conferring with MDH officials to ensure accurate assessments of illnesses are made so they aren’t excluding children based on irrational fears, such as, “This student looks Asian so we’re going to be concerned, or this child traveled.”
The risk of becoming sick with the virus remains low in Minnesota, so MDH is not recommending that schools cancel events or extracurricular activities.
School staffs are taking stock of e-learning capabilities — which is not uniform across the state — and weighing the effects closures would have on staff salaries, student meals and the school calendar. MDH has created a coronavirus webpage with information specifically for schools."
"March 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/target-s-new-cfo-says-company-will-continue-to-invest-to-compete/568311542/,StarTribune,Target decides to broadcast investors' meeting from Minneapolis because of coronavirus concerns,"Target was initially going to spend at least $7 billion over the past three years to refresh hundreds of stores, open dozens of new ones and upgrade the company’s technology and supply chain.
The cost for capital expenditures over that time span ended up coming in closer to $9 billion as it decided to remodel even more stores.
Investors aren’t complaining.
Those investments — along with others to roll out new private-label brands, increase employee training and roll back prices — have been heralded as some of the key reasons for the Minneapolis-based company’s resurgence as one of the best-performing retailers in the industry.
That strategic plan was unveiled in February 2017 at Target’s annual investors meeting.
On Tuesday, executives will lay out the latest updates to that road map at their annual investors' meeting.
That meeting was originally scheduled to be held in New York. But given the growing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, the company decided over the weekend to broadcast it from Minneapolis instead.
Among those making Target’s case will be a new face in the C-Suite: Michael Fiddelke, 43, a 15-year company veteran who was promoted to chief financial officer in November. Investors will also likely have lots of questions for him and the rest of the team about the retailer’s surprisingly soft holiday sales and the impacct of the coronavirus epidemic on Target’s ability to keep shelves stocked.
While Target will slightly decrease its capital expenditures as the pace of new store remodels slows after this year, Fiddelke said Target will continue to make significant investments in technology, supply chain and new stores.
“That’s the thing that we think has driven our success and so we’ll continue to keep an eye out for what are the right places we can continue to invest,” he said in an interview. “We want to play offense.”
Being able to invest “with conviction,” he added, is one of the key differentiators, as CEO Brian Cornell also often likes to say, between the winners and losers in retail today. But being able to do so requires a strong balance sheet and cash flow.
In retail, the role of the chief merchandising officer often gets the limelight because the products companies sell is what distinguishes them from one another.
But CFOs also play an important role in balancing smart investments with cost controls in order to keep investors happy. That’s something that Target has been able to do well the last few years, said Neil Saunders, an analyst with GlobalData Retail.
“But that’s a very difficult thing to do, because there’s no shortage of people who want to spend money on all sorts of different things,” he added.
Coming off an impressive year, the road ahead for Target won’t be easy, especially since it’s up against tough sales comparisons from the last year.
“There’s definitely still a lot of opportunities, but also a lot of headwinds and potential challenges — coronavirus, tariffs are still lurking, potential disruption from elections, danger of slowdown in consumer economy, and competitive challenges from Walmart and Amazon,” Saunders said.
In his first few months on the job, Fiddelke has already experienced firsthand both the highs of being at Target as well as some of the road bumps.
A couple of weeks into his new role, Target reported third-quarter sales and profits that blew away analysts’ estimates, shooting its stock up 14% to an all-time high. Target’s shares ended 2019 up nearly double where they started at the beginning of the year, a blockbuster performance unmatched by its rivals.
But 2020 has been off to a rockier start. In January, Target reported disappointing holiday sales, sending its shares tumbling. Target’s stock was knocked down another 10% last week as the spread of the novel coronavirus led to a global sell-off.
Nonetheless, Fiddelke is optimistic about Target’s future.
“I’ve got a ton of confidence in the strategy we’ve laid out,” he said. “2019 was a banner year for Target. I think we have a ton of runway to accelerate against that strategy in the years going forward.”
Target will continue to focus on curating a strong mix of owned and national brands, elevating the physical shopping experience with plans for 300 more remodels this year, and enhancing its suite of fulfillment options that include in-store and curbside pickup as well as same-day delivery, he said.
As for the coronavirus, he said Target’s teams are closely monitoring the situation, and will decide based on the best information they have before Tuesday’s meeting how to factor it into the retailer’s guidance.
Last week, executives at Richfield-based Best Buy said they are expecting first-quarter sales to be depressed from anticipated product shortages in the coming months because of coronavirus.
During the holidays, Target’s comparative sales growth came in at 1.4%, much lower than the 3% to 4% that had been forecast. Fiddelke said it was mostly about softness in toys and electronics where there wasn’t a lot of newness.
“So we’ll work with our vendor partners on that, and then we’ll build off some places where we saw some real strength and where we think we can lean in even more and be bolder,” he said, noting that apparel, beauty, and food and beverage all saw decent gains in the holidays.
The good news for Target is that Walmart also came up short of expectations with its holiday sales, said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones.
“It definitely alleviates the concern that Target is losing share to Walmart,” he said. “But I don’t think it alleviates the concern around Amazon. It heightens it because Amazon had a pretty blockbuster quarter.”
Even with the disappointing holiday results, Target still plans to report strong full-year results with comparable sales growth of more than 3% and record-high earnings per share.
Those numbers align with the financial model that Target is now using to benchmark itself against for the future. That road map calls for growth of low-single digits in comparable sales, mid-single digits in operating income and high-single digits in earnings per share, the latter being achieved mostly through share buybacks.
“That is the algorithm we will use as the right north star over the longer term,” Fiddelke said.
But Yarbrough said that while admirable targets, those will be tough metrics to hit. The company has managed strong sales growth in the past few years from big jumps in categories like apparel and home. But it’s unclear if they can continue to grow at that same rate.
And other categories where it has opportunities, such as grocery, are lower-margin areas where higher sales won’t translate as well to the bottom line.
In 2018, Target saw a big surge in its toy sales in the wake of the demise of Toys ‘R’ Us. In 2019, it saw sharp increases in its clothing sales as department stores and specialty retailers struggled.
This year, Papyrus and Pier One are among retailers announcing a large number of store closures.
Without naming names, Fiddelke said he sees more opportunities for Target to gain market share from other retailers.
“Given the investments we’re making that our guests are responding to, I expect continued share opportunities on the horizon for us,” he said."
"March 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-governor-tim-walz-updates-state-preparations-for-coronavirus/568400712/,StarTribune,Gov. Walz: Minnesota rapidly gearing up for arrival of coronavirus,"A Lakeville massage therapist is glad to hear that Minnesota's public health lab has the capacity to test for the novel coronavirus. Now she hopes they will finally test her.
The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, has bunkered herself at her home for nearly two weeks after getting sick on a trip to Singapore. And while she might be getting better, she said she is frustrated the state has denied her requests for testing and is nervous about returning to work until she knows if the virus made her ill.
Her story reflects what will likely be growing demand for testing in Minnesota, particularly now that the virus has spread globally and is being passed person-to-person in the western United States. ""This is my job; this is my life. I don't want to infect others. I can't understand why ruling out with a test is such a wrong thing to ask,"" the woman said.
Minnesota health officials said they expect more requests after they announced Monday that they no longer have to send lab samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state's lab can now test up to 100 samples per day.
State health officials said clinical judgments would perhaps result in tests of people who don't meet current CDC guidance. Whether a person has visited a country that has cases of COVID-2019, the name for the illness caused by this virus, doesn't matter as much now that there are U.S. cases, said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner.
""If you have the underlying clinical symptoms, the travel criterion is not the rule-out that it was before,"" said Malcolm, who appeared at a briefing Monday with Gov. Tim Walz and state legislative leaders. She noted that updated guidance on whom to test was sent to doctors Monday.
Even the CDC guidance on whom to test is expanding. The CDC initially recommended testing of people with fevers or lower-respiratory symptoms who had traveled to China, or who had been in close contact with such travelers. On Thursday it added sick people with recent travels to Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea — countries that are seeing growing numbers of cases. The CDC also now recommends testing for people hospitalized with lower-respiratory problems that can't be explained by other common causes such as influenza.
Some public health experts have criticized the U.S. for being too restrictive in its testing guidelines, which might have allowed the virus to enter the country and circulate unnoticed.
That appears to be the case in Washington state, where health officials late last week reported cases of infection involving people with no relevant travel histories. Malcolm said it's possible based on that experience that cases already exist in Minnesota, though the silver lining is that they must be mild cases if they haven't reached her attention.
The Lakeville woman traveled to Singapore on Jan. 29 to meet her daughter, who had been studying there, despite concerns about the virus and its impact on her health after radiation treatments late last year that could have weakened her immune system.
Concern in Singapore escalated by the day, and she was repeatedly required to take her temperature at her resort and other locations. Taxi drivers weren't wearing masks at first but all were wearing them by the time she flew home Feb. 10 via Tokyo and Seattle. She returned to work for a week but felt sick Feb. 19 and stayed home after that.
Nurses met her outside of a Lakeville clinic Feb. 21, gave her a mask and whisked her into a room. But after she tested negative for flu and strep, her doctor was told by the state health department that she didn't fit testing criteria for coronavirus.
""So I just went home,"" said the woman, who lives with her husband and two of her children.
Testing every suspect case isn't critical for treatment, because no vaccine or specific medication exists for the new coronavirus, said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director for the Minnesota Department of Health. Regardless of the type of infection, people with fevers and respiratory symptoms should stay away from school, work and public gatherings until they have been symptom-free for a full day, she said.
""Tested or not tested, that's the right thing to do,"" she said. ""And when she's recovered, hey, then she's good to go.""
There is no evidence that people are infectious after their fevers and symptoms go away, Ehresmann said. On Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recommended that people take one day after healing before going out in public.
Testing will be critically important for Minnesota as an early warning system, Ehresmann said. Positive tests in communities can alert the local schools to cancel classes, employees to work from home, or churches to provide services online.
""All those things can help slow down the spread,"" she said. ""That's partly why we want to track what's going on.""
Minnesota had previously sent lab samples to the CDC from five patients in the state whose symptoms and travel histories suggested they were at risk for COVID-2019. All five cases proved negative. The state had been receiving 60 calls a day about coronavirus in the last couple of weeks, though not all calls involved requests for testing.
Research has found that 80% of people with the novel virus suffer mild symptoms. Estimates of the death rate from infection are between 1 and 2%, which would make the virus more severe than common seasonal influenza. People who are elderly or have other health problems are at greatest risk.
Walz and legislative leaders urged calm as they develop state response plans, including coordinating with businesses, hospitals and long-term care facilities. A House committee hearing was set for Wednesday to evaluate budgetary needs to respond to the outbreak.
""This will get to Minnesota at some point,"" Walz said. ""Preparation is the way we are able to contain it, that we are able to keep the numbers lower.""
The Lakeville woman said it is difficult to feel calm, even if she has only a slight chance of being infected: ""I think it's within my right and my responsibility for those people around me to just get the test."""
"March 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/how-competitive-is-the-twin-cities-housing-market-only-3-in-u-s-are-tougher/568401182/,StarTribune,How competitive is the Twin Cities housing market? Only 3 in U.S. are tougher,"The Twin Cities has become one of the most competitive housing markets in the country, and there’s no relief in sight for spring buyers.
More than a third of all home sellers in the Twin Cities got more than their asking price last year, trailing only San Francisco, San Jose and Boston, according to an analysis of the top 35 metro areas by Zillow.
Just two months into the year buyers are outpacing sellers in many parts of the metro, leaving shoppers with fewer options than last year in every price range under $1 million.
“It’s insanity,” said Daren Jensen of Edina Realty, who recently listed a tidy midcentury rambler in Richfield for $325,000. Within 24 hours, agents scheduled 41 showings and Jensen hosted an open house. More than 80 groups of buyers showed up. “I had to shut it down, there were just too many people,” he said.
The sellers were overwhelmed, too, but with offers: 21 of them, including one for $70,000 more than the list price.
The situation is more than a little vexing for buyers, who are wooing sellers with personal letters, and waiving what are normally standard — and prudent — financing and inspection contingencies.
Last week’s stocks slump has emerged as a wild card for the housing market as has the possibility of soured consumer sentiment amid investment portfolio losses and prospects of the coronavirus fallout slamming the brakes on the economy.
So far in 2020, the housing market has been flush with a backlog of buyers who didn’t get what they wanted last year. Many are trying to get ahead of rising home prices, and they’re getting an early start. The first week of February saw 20% more signed purchase agreements than the same period a year ago, according to the Minneapolis Area Realtors. Mortgage rates last week dipped a full percentage point below last year’s levels, and are likely to remain at all-time lows as nervous investors seek refuge in the bond market.
Those early season buyers are entering a market that has 14% fewer house listings compared with last year, with those shopping for a house priced at less than $300,000 facing the biggest declines. The depleted supply is being driven in part by would-be sellers who are afraid of the competition and are staying put; empty nesters who are choosing to age in place longer than expected, and a lack of new construction in that price range.
While starter houses are most scarce, agents say move-up buyers are starting to feel the crunch, as well. Zillow data show that last year starter homes were twice as likely as the luxury segment to sell for more than they were asking. But during the last couple months of 2019 there was a meaningful increase in over-ask offers for move-up houses.
Jensen recently tried to show clients an $895,000 house in Minneapolis, but by the time they were able schedule a tour those sellers already had four offers.
“My buyers looked at me and said, ‘We’d rather look for something else,’ ” he said.
Zillow economist Joshua Clark said that while the situation is frustrating, the Twin Cities is actually one of the healthier housing markets in the nation. While the median sale price has breached record highs, annual price gains have been moderate and in line with the national average.
A price bubble, he said, is unlikely. “The Minneapolis market has been fairly steady,” he said. “But it seems the market is starting to heat up.”
So far the listing shortage is most acute in urban neighborhoods and aging suburbs like White Bear Lake, where Joy Erickson of Edina Realty recently listed an 810-square-foot house for $200,000. Within a day of hitting the market, she scheduled 24 showings and delivered eight offers to her sellers.
“Buyers who weren’t able to find something last summer have been waiting through the fall and winter for more listings,” she said.
While it’s very early, Erickson said coronavirus-induced economic jitters aren’t derailing deals.
Over the weekend, she was involved with three transactions, and during the past 36 hours she put together five deals. “None of them have expressed concerns,” she said.
Still, one client is questioning what’s going to happen. “An 8 to 1 ratio seems positive, given the week on the stock market,” she said.
The current market volatility could have another impact: even lower mortgage rates that bring even more buyers into the spring market.
Ali Wolf, director of economic research for Meyers Research, a national housing research company, acknowledges that the threat of a recession, or a sustained correction, could upend the spring market, especially if the baby boomers who control about 70% of the nation’s wealth aren’t feeling confident. “This group may be less eager to buy a home until it becomes clearer where the stock market will settle,” she said.
Erickson said the current shortage of house listings is forcing many buyers to bid on houses that don’t fully meet their expectations or have cosmetic flaws.
“Sellers are excited that they do not need to do as many things to their houses as they thought they would,” she said. “Everything does not need to be ‘HGTV like’ to sell a home.”
Erickson said that in addition to helping buyers write letters to the sellers, many are sweetening their offers in other ways. That includes shortening inspection contingencies to five days rather than 10, and telling sellers they’ll call out only health and safety concerns.
For buyers, waiving contingencies can be risky. Forgoing an inspection means an expensive defect might go overlooked. Waiving a financing contingency could mean that an appraisal comes in below the agreed-upon purchase price and the buyer is on the hook for the difference between what the lender thinks the house is worth and what the buyer has agreed to pay.
Many buyers are also waiving home-sale contingencies, which let buyers out of the deal if the home they already own doesn’t sell. In a swift market with low inventory, that’s often not a problem, but buyers can be left with two overlapping mortgages.
Jensen, the agent who quickly sold the rambler in Richfield, wasn’t able to say how much more the sellers got because the sale hasn’t closed yet. But he said that unless the highest offer is also a cash offer, it’s not always the strongest offer. In the case of the Richfield house, three of the 21 offers were for cash.
“You often have to take that [the highest offer] out of consideration because you know the house is not going to appraise,” he said. “They took an offer they knew would close.”"
"March 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/coronavirus-outbreak-slows-work-at-factories-in-minnesota-midwest/568397152/,StarTribune,Impact of coronavirus arrives on doorstep of Minnesota companies,"The impact of the coronavirus is showing up on the doorsteps of Minnesota factories and other Midwestern manufacturers, a harbinger of how the spread of the illness could ripple through the broader U.S. economy.
Four in 10 supply managers in a nine-state region from Minnesota to Arkansas reported negative business effects from the illness in February, according to a monthly report from the Creighton Economic Forecasting Group.
Manufacturing imports plummeted for the month due to factory shutdowns and quarantines in China, and about 27% of companies had been forced to cease or reduce international buying.
A quarter of supply managers said their firms had switched to domestic vendors for inputs to their operations.
“This is front and center where you’d expect to see most concerns,” said Ernie Goss, director of Creighton University’s Economic Forecasting Group, who said he was surprised to see how widespread the business challenges had become for manufacturers, and the speed of the coronavirus’ effect on operations.
“The real key would be can you get inventories, can you get raw materials and supplies?” he said. “There are some indications that it made it more difficult.”
Manufacturing is a leading indicator of the health of the economy in the Midwest. The Creighton forecasting group’s overall index, known as the Mid-America Business Conditions Index, assesses new orders, production or sales, employment, inventories and delivery lead time.
Manufacturing continued to expand in February, according to the index, but growth is slowing in part due to the coronavirus. Any index greater than 50 indicates an expanding economy during the next three to six months.
Across the nine-state region — Minnesota, the Dakotas, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma — the index for February was 52.8, down from 57.2 in January, which was the highest level in 11 months.
Minnesota’s index was 53.3, down nearly five points from January. Many of the state’s biggest agricultural and manufacturing players, such as Cargill and 3M, rely on global sourcing and have an outsized effect on the measure, Goss said.
During the past 12 months, Minnesota manufacturing employment growth ranked next-to-last in the region, contracting by minus 0.5%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data cited by Goss in the report.
Yet the state’s businesses continue to respond to a tight labor market. Wages grew by the second-fastest rate in the region, rising 6.3%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data Goss cited.
Minnesota’s survey also showed potential for future growth, with new orders at 64.9 on the index.
National numbers from the Institute for Supply Management, also out on Monday, showed that production was growing, but that new orders and employment are contracting. It uses a broader array of industries and noted that global supply chains are feeling the squeeze above all of the manufacturing industry sectors.
The February index for production manufacturing inventory registered 50.1, down from 50.9 in January.
The national numbers didn’t address the impact of the coronavirus, but Goss said results from a specific survey on the outbreak could come this week. Goss suspects Midwest manufacturers are feeling more pinch than will be reflecting nationally.
“This part of the country is pretty globally linked,” he said.
Supply managers from the Mid-America region said the coronavirus outbreak in China forced factories to “dual source,” although they said that doesn’t necessarily mean switching to domestic vendors.
Others spoke to lead times for electronic components being pushed out because of the economic slowdown in China.
As a result, employment in factories across the region, including Minnesota, was down.
The coronavirus delays produced job losses, managers told Creighton in the survey. Other factors were the continued issues from trade constraints and the tight labor market.
Looking ahead six months, economic optimism is waning. The business confidence index also slumped to 51.4 from January’s 58.8.
Goss said the emergence of the coronavirus offset the positive confidence impact of the recent passage of the U.S. Canada, Mexico trade agreement and Phase One of the trade agreement with China.
“The economy had been hammered by international factors over last year’s [second] half and now it’s getting hammered again by something very different,” Goss said.
Minneapolis-based Graco, which makes industrial spray and pumping machines, said it has seen some supply-chain slowdown but has taken steps to address it. The company’s factory in Suzhou and its Asian headquarters in Shanghai also are substantially back to work."
"March 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-stores-seeing-run-on-supplies-for-pandemic-pantries/568409652/,StarTribune,Twin Cities stores seeing run on supplies for 'pandemic pantries',"Shoppers gazed high and low as they rolled their carts down the paper-goods aisle at Costco in St. Louis Park on Monday. The bathroom-tissue and paper-towel shelves were completely cleared, causing shoppers to ask if paper products had moved to another aisle.
Consumers around the Twin Cities and nationwide flocked to stores over the weekend and on Monday to stock up on hand sanitizer, cold medicine, toilet paper and other supplies amid concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Empty shelves of certain products could be found around the metro.
An employee told shoppers that the Costco store had run out of toilet paper and would be restocked later in the week.
Amid the shopping frenzy, a number of retail stocks surged on Monday. Costco’s shares rose 10%, Walmart’s increased 8% and Minneapolis-based Target’s stock was up nearly 6% on a day when the market also rose more broadly.
There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Minnesota. But last week, state officials encouraged Minnesotans to begin preparing for the possibility of it spreading here by stocking up on supplies as well as washing their hands and covering their coughs.
Over the weekend, social media was flooded with pictures of empty store shelves around the Twin Cities and in many other parts of the U.S.
On a spot check Monday afternoon, the shelves for hand sanitizer as well as medical masks and gloves were empty at the downtown Target on Nicollet Mall.
The Target in Burnsville also was at least temporarily out of hand sanitizer Monday morning.
The Menards in Bloomington was out of masks as well.
Some Lunds & Byerlys stores in the Twin Cities “have limited or no inventory of hand sanitizer at this time,” according to spokesman Aaron Sorenson.
“We have also seen an increase in sales with regard to disinfecting wipes, cleaners, canned goods, bottled water, soup and bath and facial tissue, but our inventory levels are still in good shape on those items.”
Hy-Vee officials reported spikes in sales of hand sanitizer, but it remained in stock in Twin Cities’ stores with more shipments on the way.
A Target spokeswoman said the company would address the effect of the coronavirus on its business at its investors’ meeting Tuesday.
That meeting was originally scheduled to be held in New York, but the company hustled over the weekend to change course given the “rapidly evolving situation” with coronavirus and will instead broadcast it remotely from its headquarters in Minneapolis.
Checkout lines at the St. Louis Park Costco stretched into nearby aisles on Monday afternoon with eight to 10 carts behind each register.
“I can’t remember seeing checkout lines so long on a weekday,” said one employee. “But they were even longer over the weekend.”
The research tracking firm Nielsen said it has found significant spikes of stockpiling of emergency supplies in the U.S., China and Italy. It said consumers are rushing to build “pandemic pantries.”
In the U.S., sales of medical mask rose 378% in the four weeks ended Feb. 22. Hand-sanitizer sales were up 73% in that same time frame, according to Nielsen.
Consumers also are stocking up on canned goods, flour, sugar and bottled water, the firm said.
In the U.S., sales of supplements, fruit snacks and first-aid kits have also been rising.
Nielsen said it also expects online shopping to spike in the U.S. as people become increasingly interested in reducing exposure to others."
"March 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/tough-advice-don-t-touch-your-face/568444342/,StarTribune,Tough coronavirus prevention advice: Don't touch your face,"As three co-workers talked over coffee in downtown Minneapolis on Tuesday morning, one listened intently by folding her hands and pressing them against her lips while another rubbed her eyes.
If the best way to avoid coronavirus infection is not to touch your mouth, lips or nose, this coffee klatch is in trouble.
“It would be so hard,” said Ashley Sinclair of East Bethel. “I’m always fixing my lip gloss, touching my hair, touching my eyelashes.”
Advising people to not touch their faces is one of several recommendations that Minnesota health officials have made in the past month as they prepare for the global outbreak of a novel corona­virus to reach this state — along with asking people to cough into their elbows, wash their hands thoroughly and stock up on medications and provisions so they can stay home from work or school if sick.
The reason is simple enough: Pathogens such as the new coronavirus that emerged in China three months ago can live for short periods of time on surfaces such as doorknobs and railings. People touching those surfaces with their hands can then cause their own illnesses, a process known as self-inoculation, if they then touch orifices on their body.
The solution? Not so simple. Studies have found that most people subconsciously touch their faces multiple times per hour. At the University of New South Wales in Australia, researchers videotaped medical students at a lecture and found they touched their faces 23 times per hour, on average. And nearly half those face-touches involved the eyes, nose or mouth.
“Take note of when you’re doing it next time,” said Marylouise McLaws, the lead researcher of the study, in an e-mail. “I noticed I’m more likely to put my hands to my face as I read my e-mails. Once we take notice, we can then try to retrain ourselves.”
Years of habits aren’t easy to undo, said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director for the Minnesota Department of Health, who was rubbing her eyes when asked by a reporter about face-touching.
“It’s absolutely really difficult to change those behaviors because some of those are kind of reflexive,” Ehresmann said. “I struggle with it myself, but if you’re aware that it’s another way you can possibly become infected, you at least have a little opportunity to influence your behavior.”
Among the coffee group, Amanda Stockman of Minneapolis figured she could cut out the face-touching. She has concerns about the corona­virus and has made little changes to her routine such as mailing in a return rather than going back to the mall where she made a purchase.
“It’s serious, you know,” she said.
Maren Zirbel of Burnsville didn’t think she could stop her “thinking pose” of pressing her hands against her mouth when listening to conversation. She said she will try to do what is recommended to protect herself and others, but as the mother of three she figures she’s in trouble if the virus spreads widely in Minnesota.
School “is a petri dish, my friend,” she said.
Common cold and flu viruses often spread when infected people cough and project droplets in the air that fall on other people. That is why health officials want people exposed to the virus to call their health care providers and to practice social distancing and keep at least 6 feet away from others. Some of those people might be asked to stay at home for 14 days to determine if they are infected.
“If a health care provider or public health worker tells you to stay home for 14 days unless you need medical care, please do that,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Individual actions can have an impact on how this plays out.”
At least one study has found that other coronaviruses — which cause up to a third of common colds — last longer on surfaces than flu viruses. If that holds true for the new coronavirus, it increases the need to wash hands and avoid face-touching, but Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy said he believes airborne transmission is the greater threat.
“Respiratory transmission, just breathing in the virus, is by the far the driving force,” said Osterholm, who as a result believes that social distancing and covering coughs will prevent more illnesses than refraining from face-touching.
Roughly 80% of people suffer mild symptoms when infected by the new virus, according to initial studies, but 1 to 2% of those infected die. The death rate escalates for people who are elderly or have other health problems.
No cases have been confirmed yet in Minnesota, but health officials believe it is only a matter of time given the coronavirus’ spread from China to more than 60 countries and 12 U.S. states.
Empty store shelves reflect public concern, as many retailers are running out of soap, face masks and cleaning supplies. Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said people should follow state recommendations to reduce the spread of the virus, particularly to others in the community who are most at risk of severe symptoms.
“It’s just so vital,” she said, “for all of us to realize there are things we can do to protect ourselves and our family, but also to help with this community response.”"
"March 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/there-s-a-reason-why-you-re-so-freaked-out-by-the-coronavirus/568486972/,StarTribune,There's a reason why you're so freaked out by the coronavirus,"Don’t panic, we’re told. The risk is low to most people. You don’t need a mask unless you’re sick or a health care provider. Among healthy people, it often ends up being no worse than the flu.
On the other hand: This thing is spreading. The deaths are mounting. The end is nowhere in sight.
As the number of cases and the number of places being infected by the novel coronavirus grows, everyone from Wall Street to the man on the street seems rattled. But how much of the fear is being driven more by emotions than facts?
Some anxiety is justified. The mortality rate so far from the virus is estimated to be more than 3%, compared to about .1% for the flu.
So experts in the psychology of risk perception — the study of the sometimes irrational and often emotional factors that determine what freaks us out and what doesn’t — think that in the case of the coronavirus, we actually do have more to fear than fear itself.
“The risk is real, so let’s put on the record right now that this is a concern,” said David Ropeik, an expert on risk perception and communication.
“The challenge is keeping your worry in perspective, so you don’t do something out of worry that’s bad for you all by itself.”
Ropeik has lectured at Harvard on risk perception and is the author of a book about how some of us worry too much about the wrong things “How Risky Is It, Really?: Why Our Fears Don’t Always Match the Facts.”
He said there are a number of psychological reasons why the coronavirus crisis is triggering our fears a lot more than the flu, even though the flu, at least so far this season, has killed thousands of more Americans than the coronavirus.
First of all, it’s new.
“When something is new, we don’t know all of what we need to know to protect ourselves, and that feels like powerlessness. And that’s what makes it scary,” Ropeik said.
That’s even though some of what’s known so far about the disease doesn’t sound too frightening.
“I mean 98 % or more recover, often with a mild case. So what’s the big problem?” said Paul Slovic, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon and an expert on decision making in conditions of risk.
But Slovic said, “When we see the pictures of the health care workers (responding to coronavirus outbreaks), they’re dressed in hazmat suits and moonsuits. We don’t see that with the flu.”
A lack of control can be a big factor in what makes something scary or not, according to Slovic and Ropeik.
That’s the reason why most of us aren’t scared of driving, despite the risk of a fatal traffic accident, because we feel like we’re in control behind the wheel. But some of us are scared of flying partly because there’s nothing we can do to shape the outcome of the flight. (Your lifetime odds of dying in a car crash is about one in 100, according to the National Safety Council. The odds of dying as an airplane passenger is about one in 188,000.)
In the case of the coronavirus, we can wash our hands to try not to get it. But unlike the flu, currently we can’t prevent it with a vaccine shot.
“That’s very important for people. It influences people’s sense of risk, whether or not they feel that they can control it personally by their actions,” Slovic said.
Slovic said we can also try to protect ourselves by avoiding sick people. But it appears that the virus can be spread by people who don’t appear sick.
“This undercuts our sense of control, if we can’t even tell if someone is sick, if we should stay away from that person,” Slovic said.
Lack of trust in the people informing us about the problem can also make us more afraid, according to the risk perception experts.
“It’s not just half of the people who mistrust government. Half of them might mistrust this particular administration, but mistrust in government is very high,” Ropeik said.
Inconsistent messages by politicians about the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak have been a problem, Ropeik believes.
“In my opinion, to date, while the health institutions in our government have done a good job, the political institutions have been like they always are, ham-fisted and screwing it up,” Ropeik said.
And mistrust in authorities can diminish their ability to keep us safe if, for example, we disregard orders to self-quarantine and that leads to a spread of the disease, Ropeik said.
The many things we don’t know about the virus also is driving fears, Slovic said.
“We’re told by the authorities that while we should be calm and keep this in perspective, they also admit they’re still trying to learn more about this type of disease,” Slovic said. “There’s uncertainty, lack of control, fatalities, rising incidents, all of those things are worrisome. So it’s not at all surprising that we’re seeing such a strong reaction.”
Sander Gilman, a psychiatry professor and medical historian at Emory University, said concerns about coronavirus has morphed into a moral panic, a term used by sociologists to describe widespread fear and anxiety of perceived societal threats ranging from Communism to violent video games to HIV.
It’s the kind of fear that has led some people to stigmatize Asians or avoid Corona beer. There have not been any confirmed cases of the coronavirus reported in Minnesota, although two passengers arriving at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport from Europe have been told to quarantine themselves. But that hasn’t stopped people in the Twin Cities from stockpiling toilet paper.
“This is a respiratory illness. If this were cholera, toilet paper would make sense,” Gilman said. “My favorite example was an attack of graffiti on a restaurant in London, saying basically you’re the cause of the disease and everything else. And it was a Japanese restaurant. All right? That’s moral panic.”
Ropeik said he can’t tell people not to be afraid.
“Nobody can tell somebody else how worried they should be,” he said. “That’s a personal choice. Do you have kids? Are you old? Are you on chemotherapy? There’s tons of factors.”
But he said excessive worry comes at a cost, and not just to beer companies and Asian restaurants.
Worry equates to stress, and that can diminish your immune system, Ropeik warned.
“The worry alone is bad for your health,” he said."
"March 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/wisconsin-solar-installations-delayed-because-of-coronavirus-minnesota-developers-worried/568483652/,StarTribune,Wisconsin solar installations delayed because of coronavirus; Minnesota developers worried,"Coronavirus-induced supply-chain breakdowns in China have caused the developers of two large solar-power projects in Wisconsin to declare force majeure, threatening construction delays. And some Minnesota solar companies are wary that manufacturing bottlenecks could soon hurt them, too.
“I’m definitely concerned about it because a lot of solar-project components come from Asia,” said David Amster-Olszewski, CEO of Denver-based SunShare, which is a significant developer of community solar projects in Minnesota. And delays aren’t the only problem.
“Any interruption impacts pricing for the whole supply chain,” he said.
Asia, and particularly China, is the globe’s primary supplier of solar cells and panels, and is also a major source of inverters and racking system components. Racks hold solar panels in place; inverters convert panels’ DC current into AC.
Also, about 80% of the specialty glass used to manufacture solar panels comes from China, said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene, a solar-panel maker in Mountain Iron, Minn.
“We have glass now,” he said. “But are [shipping] containers going to start being delayed? We don’t know yet.”
In a solar panel, the energy-producing cells are basically sandwiched between glass and a “backsheet” made of polymers. Heliene has a potential problem with the latter component, too.
The company primarily sources its backsheets from a factory in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, which is also suffering a coronavirus outbreak. Production has been temporarily disrupted there, too, though Heliene still has some backsheet inventory.
In all, more than 94,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide, according to the Associated Press. More than 3,200 people have died, including more than 10 in the U.S. It has caused havoc with the Chinese economy and has spread to more than 80 countries, with significant outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy.
Two solar developers last week declared “force majeure” on solar farms under construction in southwest and northeast Wisconsin. Force Majeure — “superior force” in Latin — is a contract clause invoked when extraordinary circumstances from weather to war prevent a contractor from meeting its obligations.
NextEra Energy Engineering and Construction, an arm of one of the nation’s largest solar developers, declared force majeure because of factory shutdowns and travel restrictions in China, the company said in a filing with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission.
The interruptions are “adversely impacting” the delivery of racking systems to be used at the Two Creeks solar project about 30 miles southeast of Green Bay. Florida-based NextEra believes the delay will impinge on its work at Two Creeks and will require an “adjustment to the Project schedule,” according to a regulatory filing.
Chicago-based Invenergy, another large solar-power developer, declared force majeure on the Badger Hollow project near Montfort in southwestern Wisconsin. Invenergy said in a Wisconsin regulatory filing “there exists the potential for delays,” and also cited travel restrictions and factory shutdowns in China.
Brendan Conway, a spokesman for the majority owner of the two solar projects, WEC Energy Group, said in an e-mail that construction on both continues. “It’s too soon to say if international supply chain issues will cause any significant delays,” WEC Energy Group said.
Two Creeks, which broke ground last summer, is Wisconsin’s first large-scale solar project, with a planned 150 megawatts of capacity. Badger Hollow, a two-phase project that’s also under construction, is even bigger with up to 300 megawatts.
By contrast, the largest solar farm in Minnesota is the 100-megawatt, 440,000-panel North Star project in Chisago County that supplies power to Xcel Energy. No other such large-scale “utility” solar projects are under construction.
But that’s not the case for Minnesota’s community solar gardens: small projects that usually produce up to one megawatt of power.
In January, Minnesota had around 150 community solar gardens either in the design or construction phase, according to a filing with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The state already hosts around 270 community solar projects, which together provide more than 650 megawatts of power.
Xcel, which administers the state’s community solar-garden program, said it has not heard of any construction delays because of coronavirus-induced supply-chain issues. A representative of a Minnesota trade group for the solar industry said the same. Still, worries about supply-chain failures are radiating through the industry.
“Obviously we are very concerned about coronavirus and we are getting initial reports of supply disruptions,” said John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy and general counsel for the Solar Energy Industries Association, a national trade group.
“While those reports are limited in scope now, companies are making contingency plans and backup arrangements in the event of more significant disruptions.”"
"March 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-nonprofits-foundations-prep-for-possible-coronavirus-outbreak/568506912/?refresh=true,StarTribune,"Minnesota nonprofits, foundations prep for possible coronavirus outbreak","Minnesota nonprofits and foundations are planning for how to respond if an outbreak of the coronavirus hits Minnesota — especially how to keep serving the state’s vulnerable populations.
On Wednesday, about 200 nonprofits and foundations heard from experts about how to prepare for the possible outbreak in an event organized by the Minnesota Council on Foundations, the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits and the state. While there have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Minnesota, nonprofits are drafting plans, just like other businesses, on how to continue to operate remotely if staff are quarantined at home.
But unlike other businesses, some nonprofits provide emergency services and can’t close. In downtown Minneapolis, People Serving People doesn’t plan to shut even if there’s an outbreak.
“We do feel what we do here is absolutely essential,” said Jake Gale, senior director of operations and planning at People Serving People. “We feel like we have a solution to be able to safely and healthily serve families.”
Nearby, St. Stephen’s Human Services is looking for donated hand sanitizer, masks and frozen meals in preparation for the possible outbreak, while Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, which houses hundreds of people in shelters and housing, is boosting education efforts about how to prevent the spread of any illness.
“This is an emerging disaster,” Tanya Gulliver-Garcia, assistant director of major initiatives at the Washington, D.C., Center for Disaster Philanthropy, told Minnesota nonprofits and foundations.
She also encouraged foundations to step up since private philanthropy can be more flexible and innovative than government, adding: “All funders are disaster philanthropists.”
The outbreak is already spurring a rise in philanthropy internationally, with $1 billion in donations rolling in for COVID-19 medical supplies, almost entirely from companies, not foundations, she said. That’s compared with $363 million in donations that came in over six months during the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic.
Besides putting operational plans in place, Gulliver-Garcia recommended that foundations reach out to grantees to see if they can help out or launch a COVID-19 fund. If a coronavirus outbreak hits a shelter, she said it’s likely the entire shelter would be quarantined for two weeks.
“This is something all shelters should think about,” she said, adding the preparation extends beyond coronavirus to any spread of illness in close quarters, such as norovirus.
At People Serving People, which houses more than 300 people each night, Gale said the nonprofit already has hand sanitizer and surgical masks left over from H5N1 bird flu concerns.
There’s no plan to close the shelter, he said.
“None of that is going to change,” he said of providing meals and beds for families.
Among Minnesota’s nonprofit sector, museums also draw hundreds of people, particularly student school groups.
The Minnesota Children’s Museum in St. Paul is stepping up disinfecting its spaces, doing more cleanings throughout the day and adding stronger cleaning materials. But the museum has no plans to close or cancel events. Neither does the Works Museum in Bloomington, though spokeswoman Kara Newby said it’s monitoring local schools and will follow Health Department recommendations.
At the Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul, known for its hands-on science exhibits, hand sanitizer stations have been doubled. The museum has an extensive plan for the possible pandemic and a medical team on site as usual, but has seen no decrease in ticket sales so far out of health concerns.
“It’s a big deal; we see a lot of school groups. It’s a different time,” said Richard Walker, the director of public safety and security, adding that the organization is in daily contact with health officials. “Let’s be really smart about this; we are the Science Museum. Let’s not let fear be the driver for this.”"

Pence was slated to headline an event at the InterContinental St. Paul Riverfront hotel at 5 p.m. with Second Lady Karen Pence. He will no longer attend the event because of his duties leading the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Karen Pence will still appear at the “Keep America Great” event, which is part of President Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election bid.
The vice president’s scheduled visit to 3M earlier in the day will go on as planned.
The visit comes on the heels of Minnesota’s presidential primary on Super Tuesday. Trump narrowly lost Minnesota in 2016, putting the state in his sights for the 2020 election."
"March 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/act-now-to-protect-minnesota/568537062/,StarTribune,Act now to protect Minnesota in coronavirus epidemic,"As the U.S. battens down for the fast-spreading coronavirus, it’s good to know Minnesota was farseeing enough to create a public health fund that could be mobilized in emergency situations such as the one we now face.
What remains now is to, well, fill it. The fund has a balance of about $4.6 million. That’s a start, but it won’t go far when all the needs associated with a possible pandemic are considered. Testing alone could decimate the account. A state Senate bill proposes to add $5 million, while a House proposal has an as-yet-unnamed amount.
Minnesota Health Department officials testified to lawmakers on Wednesday that they need $25 million. As Health Comissioner Jan Malcolm explained, “More cases will be coming in every day.” The amount requested, she said, is “what we expect, that’s what we’re looking for.” A good chunk of that money would go to pay for health workers who will be focused on dealing with the outbreak.
The amount — which the department should get as quickly as possible — is modest when compared with some states. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee recently sought — and got — a $100 million package from that state’s Legislature. The spread in Washington has been rapid, and as of late afternoon Thursday the state had 70 confirmed cases and 11 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The Washington state Senate unanimously passed Inslee’s request less than 72 hours after he made it.
At a Wednesday Minnesota House hearing, Minnesota Hospital Association officials testified that an outbreak here could require hospitalization for 20% of those infected, with 5% likely to need intensive care. In New York, four days after the first case was detected, 22 cases had been confirmed and two patients were in intensive care.
Minnesota, thankfully, is not there yet. But there is no sense in pretending the danger isn’t edging closer. There are now nearly 98,000 confirmed cases in almost 90 countries. The virus is in 18 U.S. states, including Illinois and Wisconsin.
Underscoring the importance of preparation here is congressional action. Setting differences aside, the Democratic House and Republican-led Senate in rapid succession adopted an $8.3 billion package to combat the virus, $10 million of which will come to Minnesota, according to Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith.
The Minnesota Legislature must now do its part and act. When the virus hits, resources must be mobilized immediately.
“This is something that affects us all,” Republican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka told an editorial writer. “Working together we’re going to get a good product, and be able to address this in the best possible way.”
DFL House Speaker Melissa Hortman said she, Gazelka and DFL Gov. Tim Walz have had strong cooperation so far. That’s important, because the scope and duration of this outbreak remains unknown. Even beyond the medical aspect, leaders may also have to look at mitigating the economic impact. They also need to look longer range. Hortman said she is particularly concerned that legislators anticipate what may be needed once they adjourn in May. “We want the state to have enough resources that we don’t have to have a special session,” she told an editorial writer.
Walz said recently that “preparation is not panic. Preparation is the right thing to do.” He’s right. But those preparations should also be as speedy as possible."
"March 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/bloomington-based-donaldson-lowers-revenue-forecast-due-to-coronavirus-other-market-disruptions/568525342/,StarTribune,"Bloomington-based Donaldson lowers revenue forecast due to coronavirus, other market disruptions","Donaldson Co. said uncertainties because of the coronavirus outbreak and other disruptions could affect sales for the rest of the year. Already, second-quarter sales were down 6%, affected greatly by the decline of the tractor-trailer market.
Still, the Bloomington-based maker of filtration products exceeded its second-quarter earnings expectations, with net income of $64.4 million, up 7% from the same period a year ago. Earnings per share were 50 cents, up from 46 cents.
""Strong gross margin performance and disciplined expense management contributed to record second quarter net income, despite a softer-than-expected demand environment,"" said Chief Executive Tod Carpenter in a statement. ""Our margin expansion initiatives mitigated the profit impact from lower sales of new equipment and replacement parts, and favorability in nonoperating income.""
Some of the biggest sales declines in Donaldson's second quarter were from its engine-products segments, particularly sales of parts for Class 8 trucks, the largest and heaviest tractor-trailers. Sales for the on-road unit under engine products were off 21%.
Navistar International, which makes large trucks, reported this week a loss of $36 million for its first quarter, with revenue down nearly 25%. The company said new orders for heavy trucks have collapsed with Class 8 truck orders down 83% during the first quarter.
Already the industry was facing a decline. The trade publication FreightWaves reported that U.S. orders for heavy trucks that were in but not yet built at the end of 2019 were 123,000, down from 297,000 — a record — at the end of 2018, according to ACT Research. Thousands of layoffs occurred during the fourth quarter, including 1,300 workers from Navistar in December.
Donaldson's industrial-products segment saw a decrease of 3.5%, but unexpectedly strong demand from disk-drive companies and good demand from the automotive market for venting products used in batteries and powertrain apparatus. The disk-drive and automotive sales fall within the special-applications category, which saw a sales increase of almost 11% in the quarter.
In reducing the sales guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year, Carpenter noted the uncertainties around the coronavirus outbreak and said that the company would focus on the health and safety of its employees across the world through coordination and collaboration. And despite political and economic uncertainties, he emphasized the company would remain focused on its long-term goals.
The global manufacturer of industrial-filtration products has about 14,000 employees in more than 40 countries, including operations in Wuxi, China. Carpenter said on the company's earnings call that none of Donaldson's employees had contracted the virus but the company was responding where appropriate with work-from-home flexibility, increased cleaning and personal protection supplies and rethinking travel plans.
The company is now expecting its fiscal 2020 sales to be down between 3% and 7% from the $2.8 billion it recorded in fiscal 2019. Donaldson's fiscal year ends July 31.
The company also lowered its earnings-per-share range and now expects to earn between $2.05 and $2.19 per share in fiscal 2020.
The updated guidance does not reflect the pending divestiture of the Exhaust and Emissions business announced last week. The company has an agreement to sell that nonfiltration business to Wisconsin-based Nelson Global Products; the deal is expected to close during Donaldson's third quarter.
Shares of Donaldson closed at $48.06, down less than 1% Thursday amid steep losses in the overall market. Shares of Donaldson have been trading between $43.84 and $58.32 over the previous 52 weeks."
"March 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-set-for-more-novel-coronavirus-testing/568540932/,StarTribune,Minnesota set for more novel coronavirus testing,"Minnesota's state health lab tested another 10 samples Thursday morning for the novel coronavirus that is causing a global outbreak and is preparing for an increase based on new federal guidance that permits any testing that a doctor recommends.
The Minnesota Department of Health has requested $25 million to respond to the outbreak, including funding for 6,000 coronavirus tests this year. The amount is based on the state's history of testing during the H1N1 swine flu outbreak a decade ago.
""If it's anything like H1N1 … we could at the peak be running 300 tests per week,"" said Margaret Kelly, state deputy health commissioner.
So far, tests of 22 samples from suspect patients have found no cases in Minnesota of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus that emerged in China in December and spread rapidly.
Federal guidance has changed, even since Monday when the state stopped sending samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and started its own testing.
At first, the CDC advised testing only for people with fever and respiratory symptoms who had traveled to China, Italy, Japan or South Korea, or who had been in close contact with such travelers.
Then it added hospitalized people whose illnesses weren't explained by other infections. Now the CDC and Vice President Mike Pence have removed such limits.
The expansion comes as good news for some Minnesota families, who had been left in limbo worrying that their illnesses were caused by the new coronavirus.
One family in Grand Rapids went into quarantine all week after a daughter returned home sick from studying in Florence, Italy. The CDC has discouraged nonessential travel to Italy, which has reported 2,500 cases and 80 deaths from COVID-19.
Testing had been refused at first but approved Thursday after the family received support from local public health and school officials.
Others were unsuccessful. One Iron Range mother went to her doctor Thursday because her 11-year-old son suffered a fever after a trip to Disney World last month. The doctor left the clinic room to call about testing and returned wearing goggles and a face mask but said the case didn't meet state criteria, the woman said.
The families told their stories confidentially because of concerns over being publicly linked to the coronavirus.
While the state lab will be able to test up to 100 samples per day, health officials are concerned about capacity and conserving testing for people who need it most.
The potential for confusion is high, as COVID-19 fears are coming while the influenza and RSV viruses are circulating along with common coronaviruses that cause colds every year.
To guide doctors, the state issued a health alert Thursday indicating that they should rule out influenza and other pathogens first, and still prioritize testing for now for people with relevant travel histories, patients with infections of unknown origins, and health care workers who treated infected patients.
When the state tests samples, it asks ill patients to stay home and keep away from others until the results come back. The test itself is completed in a day, but there can be delays in delivering samples from outstate clinics to the lab in St. Paul.
Others now under self-quarantine include two University of Minnesota students who flew home Tuesday after having contact in Europe with someone who had COVID-19.
After being alerted to a person with COVID-19 in Europe who had ties to Minnesota, state health officials determined the infected person had been in proximity to the U students. That meant they were at risk for infection.
State health officials then alerted the CDC's quarantine station at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, and learned that the students were in midflight back to Minnesota.
CDC officials evaluated the students after the plane landed and confirmed they had no symptoms. While the risk to other passengers was minimal, they will be notified if the students experience symptoms in the next two weeks."
"March 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/vice-president-mike-pence-visits-3m-on-coronavirus-tour/568524912/,StarTribune,Vice President Mike Pence praises 3M on coronavirus tour,"Vice President Mike Pence, arriving Thursday at the 3M Innovation Center in Maplewood, described an “all hands on deck effort” to combat the spread of coronavirus, which has alarmed health officials around the world.
Pence expressed confidence about the availability of coronavirus test kits but acknowledged, “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.”
“For those who we believe have been exposed, for those who are showing symptoms, we’ve been able to provide the testing,” he added. “But as more Americans take an interest in this or have concerns about this, we want to make sure they have access to a coronavirus test as well, and we’ve made real progress on that in the last several days.”
The vice president’s trip to 3M was part of a cross-country tour in his role leading the White House Corona­virus Task Force. He was met by 3M CEO Mike Roman, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other government and industry officials. 3M is a maker of the N95 respirator, a type of face mask used as personal protective equipment against airborne particles.
Pence credited 3M for going to full production level for respiratory masks as the virus started spreading in January. “You are playing a vital role in the health of our nation,” he said. He added that the risk for the average American “remains low” and recounted steps the administration has taken, including travel restrictions and quarantines.
He offered condolences for the 11 U.S. deaths to date but said “the good news is that the vast majority of those who contracted the coronavirus in our country” have gotten treatment and are recovering.
Pence was next scheduled to head to Washington state to speak with officials about the coronavirus. That trip forced him to cancel a campaign event later Thursday in St. Paul with Second Lady Karen Pence.
The vice president’s visit came as Minnesota lawmakers have been holding hearings on the state’s response to a potential regional outbreak of COVID-19, the illness the coronavirus causes. The Minnesota Health Department has asked the Legislature for $25 million in emergency funding in response to the virus, which has spread around the globe from China.
Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Thursday that Minnesota’s public health laboratory can conduct tests and has been doing so since Monday. But she added that the state does not yet have the capacity to test everyone who wants to be tested. As Pence departed 3M, he reached out for a handshake with Malcolm, who instead offered an elbow bump to avoid spreading germs.
In Congress, the Senate approved an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill Thursday to combat the new virus, a day after the bill passed the House.
At 3M, Walz used the vice president’s visit to underscore the multilayered approach to confronting the virus.
“The vice president being here speaks to that, of understanding that governors and state public health officials are going to be the ones that are going to have to be administering back so that collaboration is happening,” Walz said.
Although stores have seen a run on face masks in recent weeks, health officials warn that they are intended for health care professionals caring for sick patients and generally not effective in preventing the public from catching coronavirus.
Addressing the “average American,” Pence said unless people are ill, they have no reason to buy a mask. That will mean more are available for patients and health care workers, he added.
“The reality is that despite that we now have cases … the risk to the average healthy American of contracting coronavirus remains low,” Pence said. There will be more cases, he added, but said it seemed to be affecting older populations, noting increased inspections of nursing homes.
“At the president’s direction we’re going to continue to lean into this,” he told reporters.
Accompanying Pence were Stephen Hahn, commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus coordinator, and Malcolm. The 3M executives meeting with Pence were Mojdeh Poul, executive vice president for the Health Care Business Group, Michael Vale, executive vice president of the Safety and Industrial Business Group, Denise Rutherford, senior vice president for corporate affairs and Omar Vargas, vice president for global government affairs."
"March 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/fed-can-soothe-markets-but-it-can-t-reopen-factories/568537042/,StarTribune,"Fed can soothe markets, but it can't reopen factories","The Federal Reserve did what it could Tuesday to offset the growing economic impact of the coronavirus by announcing a supersize reduction in its benchmark interest rate — the first time the Fed has acted between its regularly scheduled meetings since the financial crisis in 2008.
But the Fed is ill-equipped to limit the effect of a global pandemic alone. Lower interest rates may eventually soothe financial markets and help to hold down borrowing costs, but the Fed can’t speed the reopening of Chinese factories or reverse Facebook’s decision to cancel an annual developers conference that last year brought 5,000 visitors to San Francisco.
The real work falls on the rest of the government. The first step should have been simple: ensuring that testing for the coronavirus was readily available and, better yet, free. But even after weeks of lead time for the virus’s inevitable arrival, access to testing remains woefully inadequate.
At this point, the crisis also demands unorthodox solutions. To restrict the spread of the coronavirus, the government needs to put limits on commerce. The best way to protect people, and the economy, is to limit economic activity. That is an unfortunate but inescapable truth. Public health officials will need to impose quarantines, businesses will need to cancel meetings. And most of all, the problem now and going forward is making sure that sick workers stay home. That means not forcing employees to choose between penury and working while coughing.
Congress can help by mandating that workers receive paid time off if they fall ill, or if they need to care for an ailing family member. Such a policy is necessary both to impede the spread of the virus and its economic harm. Roughly one-quarter of workers in the private sector — about 32 million people — are not entitled to any paid sick days. Absent legislation, they face a choice between endangering the health of co-workers and customers and calling in sick and losing their wages and perhaps also their jobs.
The current system is practically devised to spread infectious disease. Among the people least likely to have paid sick days, and therefore most likely to work through illness, are low-wage service workers like restaurant employees and home health care aides. (Those workers also are less likely to have health insurance, which compounds the problem.)
Most developed nations require employers to provide some form of paid sick leave, and the United States should do so, too. Some states already mandate sick leave, and a recent study found that the adoption of such laws reduced cases of influenza by 11% in their first year. Whatever the course of the coronavirus, mandatory sick leave for American workers would improve the lives of families and insulate the economy against pandemics."
"March 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-house-passes-paid-family-and-medical-leave-bill/568543192/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Minnesota House passes bill for paid family and medical leave,"Minnesota workers would be eligible for up to 12 weeks of extended paid leave after giving birth or if they need to care for a sick family member under a House bill passed Thursday night.
Business groups and Republicans raised concerns about the proposal’s cost and impact on small businesses, and the measure appears unlikely to become law this session. Companion legislation in the Republican-led Senate has failed to progress. But advocates showed up at the State Capitol to demand action on the measure, saying the spread of coronavirus has crystallized the importance of allowing workers to take time off when they need it. The measure passed 70-59.
“We need to make sure people can stay home from work and school when they’re sick without worrying about having to pay the rent or put food on the table,” said Dr. Hannah Lichtsinn, who spoke at a news conference while holding her 6-year-old daughter on her hip.
Workers currently can get 12 weeks off under federal law without losing their jobs, but that time is unpaid. This paid family and medical leave bill would allow someone to receive a percentage of their wages while taking time off for a variety of reasons, including giving birth, adopting a child or having to care for a sick family member. A number of states have passed similar legislation.
Both employers and employees would pay into a fund to cover the benefits and administrative costs of the program. A House fiscal note says roughly $1.3 billion would be collected during 2022 and 2023. About 300 employees are needed to build the system, and it would take 3 ½ years to get it started, said bill sponsor Rep. Laurie Halverson, DFL-Eagan.
The National Federation of Independent Businesses urged lawmakers to oppose the bill, calling the numbers “eye-popping.”
“We are especially opposed to the new tax created in the bill that will be levied on every business and most workers and have very credible concerns that the tax will grow significantly over time,” the federation wrote to legislators.
Employers already need to offer competitive benefit packages to retain staff with the worker shortage, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, recently said of the idea, adding, “I think the market is going to take care of itself anyway.”
President Donald Trump signed a bill in December granting 12 weeks of paid leave for federal employees. Gazelka said Trump’s attention to the topic is important, but passing the House’s bill would have a different impact.
“You have a huge organization, the federal government, and that’s different from small business,” said Gazelka, who is concerned that small businesses would not be able to survive if they had to give workers 12 weeks of leave."
"March 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/damage-to-airlines-from-virus-slowdown-could-be-as-bad-as-2008-downturn-industry-says/568543452/?refresh=true,StarTribune,"Damage to airlines from virus slowdown could be as bad as 2008 downturn, industry says","The coronavirus outbreak’s effect on airlines threatens to become as severe as the blow dealt by the Great Recession.
Already, travel demand is dropping globally, and airlines are drastically reducing flight capacity while offering new waivers to passengers.
If the virus spreads more extensively, the plunge in air travel could amount to $113 billion in lost revenue for the world’s airlines, about one-fifth of their annual total, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said Thursday. That’s on par with the effect of the 2008-09 recession and worse than the SARS outbreak in 2003.
“The turn of events as a result of COVID-19 is almost without precedent. In little over two months, the industry’s prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s chief executive, said in a statement.
Airline stocks have fallen nearly 25% since the outbreak began, more than they did at a similar point in the SARS crisis when cases were confined mainly to Hong Kong and southern China.
Corporations are imposing bans on nonessential business travel for their employees, and major conferences and meetings are being canceled or postponed.
With corporate travelers a key source of airline profits, carriers are cutting operations and costs.
Delta Air Lines, the dominant carrier at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has reallocated dozens of widebody aircraft, typically reserved for long-haul flights, to snowbird routes, like MSP to Las Vegas and MSP to Phoenix.
Last month, neither of those routes had any Delta large widebody aircraft flying them. This month, widebody aircraft are scheduled to appear on those routes dozens of times, said OAG, a UK-based global travel data provider.
United Airlines has slashed its international flights by 20% and its domestic flights by 10% in April. The Chicago-based airline enacted a hiring freeze and asked employees to volunteer for unpaid leave.
“This has the potential to be the worst-ever incident to impact the aviation industry — bigger than SARS, bigger than 9/11 — with the potential to linger in consumer confidence for quite some time,” said John Grant, a senior analyst with OAG. “That’s because 20 years ago, the size of the aviation market was nowhere near as large as it is today.”
Coronavirus could reduce global business travel by $46.6 billion per month, or 37% of average global monthly spending, according to the poll by the Global Business Travel Association.
“Since corporate travel is down substantially and is not expected to recover for at least one to two months, we expect airlines to consider discounting to attract domestic leisure passengers,” wrote Helane Becker, a senior research analyst at Cowen Equity Research, covering airlines.
This could mean some nice, unexpected perks for leisure travelers, but at a cost to the carriers. Airlines typically can cover the cost of flying an international route solely through the sale of first-class and premium cabin airfares, while the economy class acts as a profit center.
While the effects have been felt most acutely by Asian airlines and global carriers with vast networks, U.S. domestic airlines will also likely need to trim back some flights in the short term, Grant said. For example, high-frequency routes will be consolidated to fewer flights per day. “That means a passenger might have to take a four-hour connection,” he said.
Twin Cities-based Sun Country Airlines is entering its busiest season — spring break. “We haven’t seen any significant flight cancellations for March,” said Kirsten Wenker, a spokeswoman for the airline. “We are monitoring the situation.”
To encourage passengers to continue booking domestic travel, Delta is offering customers the ability to change all flights booked throughout March without incurring a fee. That move, announced Wednesday, is in addition to travel waivers the airline has issued for all international flights booked before March 1.
“Delta maintains an ongoing relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the world’s foremost experts on communicable diseases,” the airline said. “We have adjusted flight schedules to affected areas, waived many change fees and are working with customers to adjust travel plans, using relationships with other airlines when needed.”
The world is more connected through air travel, with more passengers on U.S. flights from other nations than ever before, Grant said. That reflects the strength of the aviation industry and rising incomes around the world, but it has a down side.
“It can create doubt in the traveler’s mind that there might be a coronavirus-exposed passenger on my flight,” he said. “It is as much about confidence and global perception as anything.”"
"March 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/obesity-rates-keep-rising-in-the-u-s/568574172/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Obesity rates keep rising in the U.S.,"Government survey results released last week reveal the national obesity rate was 42%, which is higher than the 40% in a 2015-16 study, also done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The severe obesity rate was more than 9%, up from the 8% figure in the previous survey.
This information may have very well gotten just a cursory glance in light of all the recent attention paid to the spreading of coronavirus. But consider that being seriously overweight is a long-term medical concern that is affecting more children and adults as time goes on. Untreated obesity often leads to heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some types of cancer.
The report clearly indicates the trend isn’t likely to fade away soon. Fifty years ago about 1 in 100 American adults were severely obese. Today obesity is 10 times more common.
Thorough education about the value of sound nutrition and exercise needs to come early and often, for everyone from young children to senior citizens. There is a lot of bad information circulating, including weight-loss scams that concentrate on the quick dropping of pounds rather than a sustainable way of living that means adopting sustainable good habits.
Government support of sound nutrition also needs to be front and center; if school lunches are allowed to be less nutritional than in the past, that’s a real disconnect between cause and effect. After all, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is responsible for establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which is supposed to be the nation’s go-to source for nutrition advice. Support in communities designated as food deserts also should be a priority so there’s access to nutritional food no matter where you live.
Medical providers need to keep stressing preventive measures with their patients instead of trying to fix problems after they are well-established. Along with that is providers taking a close look at family history, which can often determine a patient’s likelihood of problems. And of course, the more affordable preventive measures are for everyone, the better off we all are."
"March 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/radisson-hotel-group-takes-precautions-as-hospitality-industry-braces-for-coronavirus/568525492/,StarTribune,Radisson Hotel Group takes precautions as hospitality industry braces for coronavirus,"Minnetonka-based Radisson Hospitality Inc. and the Radisson Hotel Group have started to take precautions as concerns over the coronavirus outbreak have begun to affect travel plans and hotel stays.
Radisson Hotel Group has temporarily closed five hotels in China in the last few weeks due to low demand. On Thursday, Radisson planned to expand its cancellation policy to waive cancellation fees through April for room reservations in China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and northern Italy, destinations where travelers have been cautioned about travel.
The hospitality company is implementing health measures such as installing extra hand-sanitation stations in public areas of some of the hotels it owns and manages, and Radisson staff continues to update its franchisee-run hotels on advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization.
Radisson leaders recently said that, other than the company’s precautions, the corona­virus’ effect on the company has been minimal.
“Concerning the potential hit from the coronavirus, so far the negative impact is considered negligible due to the limited impact of Chinese and Asian travelers on our client base,” said Federico González, president and chief executive of Radisson Hospitality AB in financial reports released last week.
Radisson Hotel Group is owned by Shanghai-based Jin Jiang International Holdings Co., which is ranked as the second-largest global hotel group with about 9,700 hotels across the world.
According to its website, Radisson Hotel Group has 19 hotels in China.
“Today we have a small footprint [in China],” said Ben Gardeen, spokesman for Radisson Hotel Group. “We have ambitions to really grow the China portfolio under Jin Jiang, our new owner there.”
One Radisson hotel under development in Wuhan, China, has postponed its opening date.
The coronavirus’ effect is already being felt by many global hotel chains as travelers change plans and major conferences have been postponed or canceled as precautions. Marriott International Inc. said last week that revenue per available room for Greater China, dropped nearly 90% last month compared with a year earlier, according to the Wall Street Journal. Hilton and Hyatt Hotels have also reported negative impacts."
"March 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/virus-will-test-minnesota-s-strong-public-health-system/568567562/,StarTribune,Virus will test Minnesota's strong public health systema,"COVID-19 has officially arrived in Minnesota, with Gov. Tim Walz announcing Friday that a Ramsey County resident who had been on a cruise ship contracted the disease.
The news is jarring but shouldn’t come as a surprise. The viral disease that originated in China has gone global and marched steadily across the United States this year. Fortunately, its Minnesota greeting party consists of the public health equivalent of a well-armed, battle-tested U.S. Navy SEAL team.
Yes, the aggressive disease trackers at the state Department of Health are that good. Not only that, they’re backed up by some serious firepower — the infectious-disease experts at the University of Minnesota, Mayo Clinic and other medical centers in the state’s world-class health care system.
That’s no guarantee against more cases or that daily life won’t be disrupted. But it should serve as a confidence-booster now that the virus has made its presence known here. It’s also a reminder that taxpayer dollars spent fortifying the state’s public health resources have been a wise investment. Few other states are as well-prepared to detect and contain COVID-19, the disease caused by a new coronavirus strain.
Thanks to strong staffing, Minnesota is able to put a large number of scientific boots on the ground during a public health crisis compared to many states. Its disease detectives are talented and experienced. In recent years, they successfully contained an outbreak of one of the world’s most contagious illnesses — measles — that originated in the Twin Cities metro area’s Somali-American community in 2017.
Many on staff also are veterans of the world’s last pandemic, which happened in 2009 and involved influenza. Being on public health’s front lines isn’t new for Minnesotans. That’s where their jobs routinely take them, and their record of working with patients and communities to stop disease spread is impressive.
This competent readiness didn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of decades of farsighted leadership within the Minnesota Department of Health and the support of state political leaders, both Republicans and Democrats. Minnesota has been especially well-served by the epidemiologists — scientists who specialize in disease distribution, spread and control — who have led outbreak investigations over the years.
Under former state epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, now at the University of Minnesota, MDH gained renown for its ability to quickly trace the origins of foodborne illness. A key part of its successful formula: mounting a ferocious effort to interview those who are ill. Casting a wide net, then sifting through the answers, allowed the team to identify commonalities and hone in on an outbreak’s origin.
The staffers and public health graduate students who make these phone calls are known as “Team Diarrhea” in honor of a common symptom of foodborne disease. The approach has won national acclaim and is looked to as an example for other states to follow. The Health Department’s praiseworthy collaboration with Minnesota Department of Agriculture scientists has also played a vital role in fighting outbreaks.
The Health Department’s pandemic planning reflects this energetic, “work the problem” spirit, too. Its staff has long been at the national forefront of planning for catastrophic disease outbreaks. They began this undertaking around 20 years ago, helping organize one of the first national pandemic preparedness gatherings in Atlanta, Ga., where the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is located. (That event featured a speech on how the media would respond. The speaker was a Star Tribune reporter who’s now an editorial writer.)
This level of expert readiness doesn’t excuse the public from doing its part, such as hand-washing and staying home from work when sick. Nor does it exempt Minnesota’s political, community and business leaders from lending their skills. The state has a long history of coming together to overcome complex challenges.
A COVID-19 task force that serves to aid and advise the state’s disease-trackers would be a sensible step. One of the benefits: Members could amplify public health messaging and back up difficult calls, such as the need to postpone public events or close schools. Such a task force could serve as a model for other states. The Legislature also should provide MDH with additional funding, as the Star Tribune Editorial Board has urged.
The battle between humans and pathogens is never-ending. Germs inevitably will get a temporary upper hand at some point, with pandemics one of the outcomes when this happens. As the state reacts to COVID-19 making landfall here, the expertise within our borders is reassuring."

Companies are drawing up contingency plans, assessing new ways to deploy workers and weighing the potential impact of quarantines, furloughs or closings.
But the nitty-gritty can get complicated quickly.
Having employees work from home can lead to headaches beyond technology. Businesses need to guard against trade secrets or private consumer data getting in the wrong hands if employees use an unsecured network or a personal computer. No one wants an external drive loaded up with customers’ bank accounts getting accidentally left on the bus.
Employers must consider how to manage work shifts if there are widespread school closings. Or how to handle a rash of workers’ compensation claims. “Come up with a plan now,” urged employment lawyer Aaron Goldstein. “It’s your Number 1 protection.”
Other concerns arise in industries where working remotely isn’t an option, such as restaurants, construction, manufacturing, child and elder care. Businesses need to keep the workforce healthy, protect the public and keep the wheels of commerce turning in the event of an outbreak in Minnesota.
“We are dependent on people showing up for work and being healthy,” said Steve Kalina, executive director of the Minnesota Precision Manufacturing Association. “There’s not really a backup plan. If you can’t run machines, you can’t run machines.”
Coronavirus is now a regular agenda item for weekly senior staff meeting at the restaurant group Parasole, whose nine brands include Manny’s Steakhouse, Burger Jones, Salut Bar American and the Good Earth.
“We’re all very worried about it,” said Donna Fahs, chief operating officer of the company. “It could paralyze our business.”
Concerns about the novel strain, which causes a respiratory illness known as COVID-19, have brought a heightened focus on sanitation: wiping down menus, tables and all items touched by customers. Employees who use cellphones during a break must wash their hands afterward.
Parasole offers paid sick leave to its 1,100 employees that Fahs said is more robust than new ordinances in Minneapolis and St. Paul, and it already follows strict health department protocols if anyone shows up sick or with a fever.
But even as workers at the company’s 14 locations strive to diminish the on-site risk, another fear looms that business will dry up if people start to avoid crowds and stop eating out.
“If someone doesn’t come in for a dinner or a birthday or a celebration, you never get that business back,” Fahs said.
The company has discussed whether it might offer delivery if restaurants need to close.
“If we don’t have sales, we can’t pay our people,” she said. “And our margins are thin as it is.”
Midwestern manufacturers already are experiencing a slowdown as quarantines and factory shutdowns in China ripple through the supply chain. Minnesota’s largest businesses, including Ecolab and Best Buy, are warning of lower sales or profits.
The outbreak has potential to reach across industries as vast as the airlines, which are reducing the number of flights amid sharp cutbacks in corporate and personal travel, right down to the neighborhood cafe, whose owners can only hope that the bank won’t turn a blind eye if they can’t make payroll or pay the bills.
“We’re talking about it as a global health crisis,” Goldstein said. “But what we’re witnessing is a global economic crisis.”
Goldstein works out of Dorsey & Whitney’s office in Seattle, now the epicenter of America’s coronavirus outbreak. In a recent webinar aimed at helping businesses manage workplace issues, he and fellow Dorsey labor lawyer Michael Droke urged companies to stay flexible and implement plans immediately.
“Communicate to employees that you’re on top of the situation,” Goldstein said. “It won’t increase panic.”
In the event of school closings, businesses could consider allowing employees to work alternative shifts on evenings or weekends to be home with their children during the day, Goldstein and Droke said.
Because it’s easier to spread disease when people are packed densely together, they suggest managing “worker density” by staggering schedules or remote workdays so that every other cube is empty.
Importantly, businesses must anticipate the need to adjust sick leave and time-off policies temporarily, so workers don’t feel their livelihood is on the line if they stay home.
Disparity in access to health care and paid leave could make the novel coronavirus harder to contain, many public health officials fear.
Overall, about 25% of Americans working in the private sector lack paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s even rarer among low-wage earners — disproportionately women, immigrants and people of color. Two-thirds of low-wage workers lack paid leave, compared with 6% of professional workers.
A large segment of such workers are home health aides, in the restaurant industry or in child or elder care.
While Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth have passed sick-leave ordinances, the state doesn’t require it, and workers in rural areas are much less likely to have the option.
“The situation I become concerned about are employees who need to make rent, who need to save their banked sick time to take care of a child, who may feel a little sick or have a slight fever,” Goldstein said. “If those people don’t feel like they can stay home, you really do risk spreading the virus.”
Gayle Kvenvold, who leads the state’s industry group for nursing homes and senior housing, is weighing multiple concerns of keeping a chronically understaffed workforce healthy and avoiding the spread of the illness to vulnerable elders and their families.
“We are not panicked, but we have a heightened sense of urgency,” said Kvenvold, chief executive of LeadingAge Minnesota.
Senior-care organizations have discussed creating staffing pools or bringing in workers from other states, which would require temporarily relaxing licensing and regulatory requirements.
LeadingAge communicates daily with its member businesses, updating health department guidelines. It checks in weekly with the Minnesota Hospital Association. Organizations are “doubling down on best practices on prevention and infection control.”
“These are unprecedented times,” Kvenvold said. “We all understand the gravity of this risk for those we serve and those we employ.”
T.J. Brooks, professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, has examined the economic impact of the flu and other pandemics, including the Spanish flu of 1918 and the more recent swine flu, or H1N1, in 2009.
“There will be pain” for some businesses, as consumers respond to fear and uncertainty. Recent evidence: stock market swings, runs on liquid sanitizer, fears of crowds forcing the cancellation of SXSW festival. With the uncertainty, businesses may cut back on supplies, inventory, staff hours or resort to layoffs.
“Even if people still spend the same, consume the same dollar amount, the types of stuff might rapidly change,” Brooks said. “If people start going to the grocery store and eating out less. Or they order more food on Amazon. It’s that switching of the consumption bundle” that causes pain.
There’s no sign — yet — that the current slowdown could topple into a recession, Brooks said. Big businesses will be able to weather it better than smaller ones.
And Brooks, a macroeconomist, suspects the economy will survive the coronavirus’ bumpy ride
“Most of the evidence suggests when we’ve had these things in the past, it’s a shock to the system that doesn’t have long-term consequences.”"

Customers were coming in to the Penn Avenue shop “nonstop,” Settergren said, “just boom-boom-boom-boom.”
At the time, Minnesota hadn’t confirmed a single case of COVID-19.
Some people don’t want to sit around waiting for the inevitable.
Some people want to smear their entire body with hand sanitizer and wait for the inevitable.
Minnesota diagnosed its first case of coronavirus the next day.
The uncertainty makes raising public awareness a tricky proposition for public health officials. They want us worried enough to wash our hands and cover our coughs, but not so freaked out we start drinking bleach and hoarding face masks.
“Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams tweeted in capslocked frustration last week. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”
You know who else needs masks more than we do? Construction workers.
“We have a lot of contractors coming in and I can’t even supply them for their workers who are dealing with dust. That’s who I feel sorry for,” said Settergren, whose wife is an infection-control nurse who could tell you that keeping your hands off your face will keep you a lot safer than some flimsy mask.
A mask isn’t going to protect you from a virus, but it is going to protect a worker from a lungful of dust. Please, for the love of lungs, stop stockpiling masks.
Do this instead.
Cover your cough. Hands off your face. If you feel sick, stay home. Wash your hands with soap and water. Lather up long enough to sing the chorus of a catchy song and rewrite the lyrics so they’re all about disease control. Think Prince and Dolly Parton. (“This is what it sounds like ... when suds fly.” “COVID, COVID, COVID-NINETEEN ... I’m begging of you, please don’t infect my mom.”)
“I think there’s no need to really panic,” said Dr. Keith Stelter, a Mankato physician and president of the Minnesota Medical Association, noting that it’s not too late to get a flu shot or the pneumonia vaccine, if you’re over 65. They won’t prevent coronavirus, but they could protect a weakened immune system from further trouble.
Despite this practical, affordable and common-sense advice, pandemic panic has emptied store shelves across the city, state and country.
We snapped up all the Purell but not the soap. We stockpiled more disinfectant wipes than we could possibly use. We bought face masks, even after the surgeon general ordered us not to.
We did it because stocking up on products that promise to kill 99.99% of viruses makes us feel more secure. The Germans have a word for it, because the Germans have a word for everything. Hamsterkauf. Panic hoarding. (Hamsters hoard food. Don’t be a hamster.)
Trying to keep your hands off your face does not make you feel secure. Your hands are probably on your face right now. The only reason my hands aren’t on my face is because I’m typing.
It’s the same reason we throw milk, bread and eggs in the cart before a snowstorm, even though this is Minnesota. At least we usually end up using the milk, bread and eggs. Much unlike the three dozen overpriced face masks you just bought online.
It might help if we stop thinking of washing our hands and covering our sneezes as ways to protect ourselves. Most of us will be fine, even if we catch coronavirus. But we need clean hands and clear eyes if we’re going to protect our more vulnerable neighbors. The sick, the elderly, the people with compromised immune systems.
“Everyone doing their own small part,” Stelter said. “That’s the way the United States will weather this.”
The Minnesota Department of Health has information and suggestions about how to protect yourself, your family and your community at health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus.
“We have had a lot of people asking about disinfectant products,” a helpful store employee posted on the southwest Minneapolis neighborhood’s Nextdoor page Wednesday evening. “Today we just got a shipment of different size hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes and spray.”
Shop employees arranged the goods in a careful display at one end of the aisle. Lysol and Clorox wipes, glistening bottles of Purell, face masks.
By the next morning, all of it was gone.
“It went quick,” said Mark Settergren, whose family has been in the hardware business since 1895, through more than a century of outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics."
"March 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/read-the-minnesota-health-department-announcement-about-state-s-second-covid-19-case/568624621/,StarTribune,Read the Minnesota Health Department announcement about state's second COVID-19 case,"The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) today confirmed a second presumptive positive case of novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The case is a resident of Carver County in their 50s who was likely exposed to COVID-19 while traveling in Europe in late February.
The patient developed symptoms on March 2, and sought health care Saturday, March 7. Samples were collected from the person and sent to the MDH Public Health Laboratory for testing and the test was found positive late this afternoon, March 8. As with the COVID-19 case announced Friday, MDH is awaiting confirmatory testing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but health officials consider the presumptive results actionable.
The patient is in isolation at home and is recovering. MDH is working with Carver County Public Health and health care partners to identify and contact all those who may have come in contact with the infected person. These people will be asked to quarantine themselves for 14 days from their exposure and will be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms.
Minnesota Commissioner of Health Jan Malcolm emphasized the important role every Minnesotan can play in helping to limit the spread of COVID-19.
“While our public health workers are busy tracking down potentially exposed people and evaluating potential cases, the rest of us must do our part,” Commissioner Malcolm said. “First and foremost that means staying home when you are sick. It also means covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands frequently, and avoiding touching your face throughout the day.”
Since the outbreak started in China in December 2019, more than 107,700 cases and 3,600 deaths have been reported in countries around the worlds. That total includes more than 500 U.S. cases and 21 deaths.
MDH Infectious Disease Director Kris Ehresmann said her team is working with the CDC and Carver County Public Health on the case and contact investigation.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spread primarily by respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza is spread. It can also spread when people touch surfaces that have been contaminated by an infected person and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth."
"March 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/coronavirus-shows-why-electing-competent-state-and-local-officials-is-vital/568629542/,StarTribune,Coronavirus shows why electing competent state and local officials is vital,"How the president responds to a disease outbreak is important, but it is only one aspect of multifaceted efforts at every level of governmental. Does a county have a system for prioritizing who receives virus tests and for delivering the results quickly? Will public transit be sanitized? Answering questions such as these is the real work of disease management — and it is not done by the White House.
For all the speculation about whether coronavirus will doom President Donald Trump’s re-election, voters motivated by the outbreak would do well to focus further down the ballot, on the state and local races that will determine who bears the lion’s share of responsibility for the response. As the coronavirus spreads in communities, it will be mayors, county judges and school superintendents — not federal officials — who make the tough calls about whether to declare a state of emergency or shutter public schools and other institutions.
Sometimes, those calls will even be at odds with what the White House recommends. During the 2014 Ebola crisis, for example, the governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, put a health worker returning from West Africa under quarantine. Christie clashed with President Barack Obama and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials, who thought the lockdown would be ineffective and discourage other health workers from going to Africa to assist with the crisis. But it was Christie, not Obama, who had the jurisdiction to decide.
Today in Maryland, it is Republican Gov. Larry Hogan — not Trump — who is working with county officials to track down contacts with the three people in the state who have tested positive for COVID-19. Hogan was easily re-elected in 2018 in part because Marylanders appreciated his efficient governance across party lines. The coming weeks will tell whether voters’ confidence was well-placed.
To the degree that the federal government does have jurisdiction in battling the coronavirus, it relies on state and local leaders to carry out its response measures. For the first time in more than 50 years, the CDC issued a federal quarantine, applied to a planeload of Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China. But federal quarantines are enforced by state officials. And once passengers disembark a plane, they are subject to the jurisdiction of the 2,800 state, local and tribal health departments across the country who are responsible for setting quarantine rules and providing the staffing to trace viral exposure.
Having knowledgeable, competent state and local officials often matters more in how a community fares during a disaster than who occupies the Oval Office. Consider Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The federal government was heavily criticized for the inadequate response to the devastation along the Gulf Coast, but it was New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, a Democrat, who delayed issuing an evacuation order, let hundreds of buses available to carry New Orleans residents to safety sit idle and saw a 15% desertion rate among the city’s police force after the storm. And it was Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, a Democrat, who delayed the federal government’s assistance by not submitting a timely formal request for help.
Katrina exposed what happens when state and local officials fail to lead and prove incapable of coordinating with one another and with federal authorities. Alarmingly, with the coronavirus, we’re already seeing states, localities and the federal government butting heads. In the Seattle area, there are signs that the virus spread undetected and caught health officials flat-footed. State and local officials are trying to ramp up testing and erect temporary housing for homeless people who may be ill while at the same time blaming the CDC for being slow to test. Pressure is mounting to permit state and local labs to run their own testing.
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, criticized the CDC for releasing a woman from quarantine in San Antonio after she tested “weakly positive” for the virus on the third of three tests. San Antonio city officials sued the CDC and asked for more testing before people quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base are released. The mayor banned people released from Lackland from entering the city until they have undergone further testing.
Our system of government is not designed for efficiency or unilateral decisionmaking. Response to disasters — whether a hurricane or a disease — is still primarily a state and local responsibility; the federal government intervenes at the request of a state. If voters head to the polls with the coronavirus in mind, they should remember that who sits in state and local offices, and how they engage with federal authorities, may be the most important decision they have to make."

Woo Kee-hong, Korean Air's president, said more than 80% of South Korea's biggest carrier's international capacity had been cut as a result of travel restrictions globally, compared with a 18% cut made during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis.
""We can easily imagine the severity of the crisis we are facing in comparison. And what is more daunting is that the situation can get worse at any time and we cannot even predict how long it will last,"" he said in a memo to employees.
Woo said Korean Air had grounded about 100 of 145 its passenger aircraft, adding that its self-help measures so far included deferring investments, cutting down on operational expenses and encouraging employees to take voluntary leave.
""But if the situation continues for a longer period, we may reach the threshold where we cannot guarantee the company’s survival,"" he said in the memo, which was seen by Reuters.
Japan joined a number of countries to impose curbs on travelers from South Korea on Thursday, adding to the woes of Korean airlines, which have been among the hit hardest by flight cancellations worldwide.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday reported 165 new coronavirus cases, bringing the national tally to 7,478 in one of the most severely affected countries outside mainland China.
Delta Air Lines, the dominant carrier at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, last month spent about $50 million to raise its stake in Korean Air's parent company, Hanjin KAL, to 11% from 9.21%.
Korean Air is a codeshare partner with Delta and the two airlines have a joint venture through which Delta has shifted its Asia base from Tokyo's Narita airport to Seoul's Incheon."
"March 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/saudi-crown-prince-tests-grip-on-power/568641932/,StarTribune,Saudi crown prince tests grip on power,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's dramatic one-two punch against perceived rivals at home and abroad is sending shock waves through the royal family, fueling turmoil in global markets and underscoring the de-facto ruler's concerns about his grip on the oil-rich kingdom.
On Friday, Saudi authorities rounded up the brother and a nephew of Prince Mohammed's father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, on the grounds they were plotting a coup, said a person familiar with the matter. The next day, the world's largest oil exporter slashed prices for its crude by the most in more than 30 years, triggering a price war with Russia that threatens to roil a world economy grappling with the coronavirus outbreak.
The prince has big plans to transform his country into a modern powerhouse, but he faces a rocky path as the outbreak pummels oil demand The arrests on treason allegations that could carry the death penalty — unprecedented against such senior relatives — suggest he's not going to let anything get in his way.
""So much of what happens under MBS's leadership is based on the element of surprise, of shifting balance, and claiming control,"" said Karen Young, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ""But the biggest threat to Saudi right now is the possibility of very low oil prices, back to 2015 or lower levels. This the crown prince will find harder to control.""
New information on Sunday from the New York Times on a connected arrest indicates that the scope of the roundup isn't known. The Wall Street Journal reported that dozens of Interior Ministry officials, senior army officers and others suspected of supporting a coup attempt were also detained. Authorities later began releasing some of those questioned in the clampdown, the Journal reported.
The arrests highlight a lingering climate of fear that has made foreign and local investors skittish, Young said. But it was already going to be a bad year in terms of economic outlook because of the global slowdown from the impact of the coronavirus and the effects on energy demand.
Brent crude tumbled by almost a third to $31 a barrel Monday as traders reacted to the Saudi price cuts. That followed the oil market's biggest drop in a decade on Friday.
Saudi authorities have yet to comment on the arrests.
The prince's efforts to cast himself as a reformer and ally of the West have run against the less-flattering reality of his ruthless consolidation of power and foreign policy adventures such as the war in Yemen and boycott of Qatar.
Three years ago he had hundreds of royals and senior businessmen rounded up on corruption allegations, locking them in the Ritz-Carlton hotel as part of a purge against perceived critics. A year later, Saudi agents killed and dismembered a prominent critic, Jamal Khashoggi, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Both shook confidence in the reform plans and effort to attract outside investment.
More recently Amazon.com boss Jeff Bezos alleged that Prince Mohammed personally hacked his phone — a claim denied by Saudi officials.
King Salman's support for his son appears to have not wavered even though ties with the West are under severe strain. President Donald Trump has also continued to back the crown prince.
Yet while many in the royal family, which numbers in the thousands, pledge loyalty to Prince Mohammed, his consolidation of power has marginalized or alienated others.
""If your position is good, you're having concerts, there's no pressure from your society, then your only opposition is from the highest level of your family,"" said Kamran Bokhari, director of analytical development at the Center for Global Policy in Washington.
The arrests underline Prince Mohammed's tactic of unbalancing domestic rivals ahead of his expected ascension to the throne. They come at a critical time as he tries to ease the fallout from his penchant for making enemies at home and abroad, and prepare for a year in the international spotlight under the Group of 20 chairmanship.
The move against people at the apex of the country's security signals that Prince Mohammed feels his position is very vulnerable, Bokhari said."
"March 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/questions-abound-about-who-pays-what-on-covid-19-coverage/568571022/,StarTribune,Questions abound about who pays what on COVID-19 coverage,"Insurers have been offering reassurances that health plans will cover costs related to testing and treatment for COVID-19, but the detail on what that means is variable — and a good illustration of fragmentation in the U.S. health care system.
In Minnesota, health plans last week were telling consumers that tests and care for coronavirus illness would be covered according to an individual's health plan benefits, yet those benefits can include significant out-of-pocket costs in the form of co-payments and deductibles.
By the end of the week, some carriers were refining the message by saying cost-sharing will be waived for patients who need the test to confirm coronavirus, but those assurances don't necessarily extend to large multistate employers with ""self-insured"" health plans. Plus, cost-sharing waivers for one particular test don't encompass other types of testing and care patients would probably use.
""There are a lot of different ways that people get health insurance in this country, and so it's hard to make a rapid announcement that will actually put people's minds at ease,"" said Cynthia Cox, a researcher with the California-based Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks health insurance issues. ""The coronavirus, in many ways, is exposing weaknesses in our health care system, from uninsured rates to high cost-sharing.""
Public health officials are monitoring a growing global outbreak of a respiratory illness called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that's caused by a new coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China.
""We are prepared, at least for the next couple of weeks, for what we think would be initially maybe a few patients showing up with an exposure history that warrants testing in our urgent cares, and the possibility of a few patients showing up in our hospitals for care,"" said Dr. Mark Sannes, a senior medical director at HealthPartners, the Bloomington-based nonprofit operator of hospitals and clinics. Sannes said the health system is ready for the long-term, as well.
For now, patients who qualify for testing aren't being charged by the Minnesota Department of Health, which is the only source for the test. In the coming weeks, private companies are expected to start providing tests, and it's unclear how the diagnostic will be priced.
Connecticut-based Cigna announced Thursday that many of its health insurance customers would have access to coronavirus testing as prescribed by health care practitioners without any co-payments or cost-sharing requirements. The policy applies to Medicare Advantage plans, Medicaid coverage and individual insurance policies, as well as ""fully insured"" employer health plans (where insurers take the risk for medical costs). But the benefit is optional when Cigna is hired to administer self-insured plans, where employers are at risk for claims costs.
On Friday, Rhode Island-based CVS Health announced that its Aetna insurance division also would provide diagnostic testing as well as telemedicine visits related to COVID-19 with no co-pays. Again, self-insured employers could opt out.
It was a similar story at the health insurance division of HealthPartners, where chief administrative officer Jim Eppel explained that self-insured employers ""hold the risk, and they make the decisions regarding benefits.""
In 2017, more than one-third of Minnesotans were enrolled in self-insured health plans, according to state data.
HealthPartners said Friday that it would waive co-pays for the COVID-19 test but said it was too soon to say whether that might extend to telemedicine visits and other services.
""This is moving quickly,"" Eppel said. ""Our main point as of today is simply: For those people who ask the question: 'If I have a COVID-19 test' — I'll call it a lab test related to COVID-19 — 'will I have to pay for it?' "" The answer is: 'No.' We'll have to work through the rest of the dynamics.""
Coverage is not in question for someone who is sick and needs treatment, Eppel said. But that's also where many patients would find that cost-sharing rules kick in, said Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation."
"March 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/worsening-global-crisis-requires-a-global-response/568644802/,StarTribune,Worsening global crisis requires a global response,"Viruses are borderless.
And given international economic integration, so are oil and equity markets, both of which were routed worldwide on Monday.
Two separate yet interrelated events occurred: Saudi Arabia announced a big oil production increase after Russia refused to take part in an OPEC accord meant to cut supply. The result was a 24% plunge in oil prices, which were already dropping due to deteriorating economic conditions related to the intensifying coronavirus crisis roiling the world.
The quick price collapse — which will impact already beleaguered countries such as Venezuela and Iran, the latter of which is an epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak — rolled right into global equity markets. European stocks were down 7% and have now entered a bear market, and Asian equities were hit hard too, led by a 5% decline in Japan.
The price action also spread to Wall Street. Although trading was halted to prevent a panicked sell-off, the Dow was down nearly 8%, as was the broader S&P 500 index. The declines were due in part to the energy sector meltdown, to be sure. But more broadly they reflected the fear, if not likelihood, of a global economic contraction that could rival the Great Recession.
Policymakers have hopefully learned lessons from that panic. And in fact the Federal Reserve moved Monday to boost short-term lending, and the New York Fed said it would follow suit to mitigate strain on the banking system.
Much more will be needed, and indeed more flares from the financial sector about liquidity concerns were sent up on Monday. The Fed, led by professionals who generally eschew the amateurish rhetoric coming from other quarters in Washington, will likely respond responsibly.
But because this is a global health, economic and — increasingly — governance crisis, more than a national response is needed. International institutions, widely derided in this populist era, need to work cohesively to mitigate the current and coming disruptions to keep the crisis from becoming a panic.
Under both Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. has traditionally led such responses. These are not traditional times, though, and President Donald Trump's performance has been anything but reassuring.
Instead, he took to Twitter Monday to pronounce the oil-sector collapse as ""Good for the consumer, gasoline prices are coming down!"" Never mind that it will hit energy workers hard and that it has also been caused by the imploding global travel industry. Trump also tweeted that ""Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News is the reason for the market drop!""
The news — including reporting on the administration's botched response in the initial phase of the coronavirus outbreak — is real. Trump's pledge to pursue payroll tax cuts, assistance for hourly wage earners, and help for travel-related industries is a tacit acknowledgment of the seriousness of the situation.
The president should quit his misinformation campaign and, backed by bipartisan consensus in Congress, urge that world leaders work together on a coordinated crisis response."

Some Chinese restaurants are anticipating a drop in business as the novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, arrives in Minnesota.
“Definitely we need to prepare for that,” said Gaoxiang Yang, owner of the Legendary Spice restaurant serving Sichuan cuisine on the University of Minnesota campus.
Asian-Americans in Minnesota are feeling the repercussions of the fear surrounding the coronavirus, and grappling with how to respond. Most of the local effects so far have been limited to worries by those who have family back in China or how to get supplies for shops and restaurants. But Chinatowns in major coastal centers have seen reduced traffic and some people of East Asian descent have reported discrimination, including two Hmong men who say they were turned away at an Indiana hotel over suspicions that they were from China and could be carrying the virus.
Yang is aware that business could be affected if the ­coronavirus spreads in Minnesota, based on what he hears from friends who own Chinese restaurants in New York and Los Angeles that are seeing large declines in customers. His establishment is doing fine for now, but he’s already stocked six months of dry goods in case there’s any issue with suppliers in big coastal cities more affected by the virus.
The state Department of Health said it has been reaching out to Asian-American partner organizations in Minnesota for weeks through an e-mail listserv, largely to connect them with accurate information that they can share with their communities.
“We have anecdotally heard of some instances of stigma or bias from individuals in the community,” Andrea Ahneman, a department spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “We have tried to put out some messaging through social media and other channels reminding people to not assume someone is sick just because they are Asian-American and to not discriminate against people.”
Some people of Asian descent have faced discrimination and accusations that they are carrying the illness. A Chinese-Singaporean man recently alleged that he was attacked in London by men who said they didn’t want his coronavirus in their country, and a man on the Los Angeles subway said that Chinese people were responsible for bringing diseases while going on a tirade against a Thai-American woman.
The Minnesota Department of Human Rights has not received any complaints about Asian-American bias yet. But Chou Moua has heard from three fellow Hmong Americans that young adults made disparaging comments about them on public transit in north Minneapolis and Frogtown, saying they wanted to avoid sitting next to them because of coronavirus.
And he’s heard of false schemes circulating about pills that cure coronavirus, which do not exist.
“There’s a lot of misinformation in the community and there are folks who may want to take advantage of the misinformation,” said Moua, who has previously lived in China and is a community activist and part of the Hmong Outreach Network.
Yang Wong, owner of China Restaurant in Roseville, said business has slowed down.
“All of a sudden it’s just like a drop,” she said. “It’s not much we can do, right? The only wish is the virus can go away soon.”
Ben Ng, owner of Bill’s Garden Chinese Gourmet in south Minneapolis, said the coronavirus hasn’t had a big impact yet, though he has friends who own restaurants in the Chinatowns of Vancouver and New York that have gone from long lines of customers to no wait times.
“I think it still will be a big impact in the next couple months,” Ng said.
Some Asian-American markets have reported a surge in customers this week stocking up on rice, in fear that the supply chain could be compromised by the virus.
“We’ve just been getting a really big rush right now,” said Joe Ku, manager of Dragon Star Oriental Foods. “A lot of customers are coming in to buy rice and noodles … definitely because they’re scared of the virus and multiple issues with shipping.”
The St. Paul store caters to people of Hmong, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Cambodian descent and gets its supplies from Chicago, New York and California. Dragon Star Oriental Foods has been ordering extra amounts to keep up, but getting enough on time has been difficult. It has raised the price for a 50-pound bag of jasmine rice from $45 to $55.
Ne Dao, manager of Ha Tien Super Market, said two pallets of rice were gone in just an hour Wednesday. The store’s California wholesaler, which gets its goods from China, has raised prices for Ha Tien. Now the St. Paul shop has to raise prices for customers.
“Our suppliers are pretty short,” Dao said.
Some Minnesotans have been sending supplies the other way, as well. The Minnesota International Chinese School, which offers language classes to more than 300 students, has been raising money to buy medical equipment to send to hospitals in Wuhan. But school attendance also has been down among Chinese-American families worried about the virus.
In late January, as concerns over the coronavirus were spreading, calligraphy teacher Chuansheng Wan of Hopkins flew back from his native China and decided to stay home for two weeks, in line with the school’s quarantine policy for any students and teachers who had traveled there.
“I think we should be very cautious but not be panicked,” said Wan, who passed his time at home with calligraphy and books.
Shasha Bao, who sends her two sons to the school, noted that her parents and in-laws remain quarantined back in their native Wuhan. She and her husband try to check on them daily.
“It’s scary to us,” said Bao, who lives in Edina. “My husband and I can’t be there to help them.”
She and some of the other parents at school are not sure if they’ll be able to make their vacations to China this summer. Mark Morrison, of Plymouth, had planned to go to China with his family in May for his father-in-law’s 90th birthday but now they’re considering an alternate trip to the Grand Canyon.
On Saturday, the school was distributing face masks and hand sanitizer for families who had ordered them.
Principal Melody Zhou has asked her children several times if they’ve felt discriminated against at school because of the virus and they’ve assured her, “Mom, don’t panic — nobody’s even talking about it.”
In the local Chinese-American community, “everybody is really taking it seriously, but we just tell people to … come back to school as normal and come back to your normal life,” Zhou said."
"March 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/congress-can-t-meet-remotely-the-coronavirus-means-it-might-have-to/568668142/,StarTribune,Congress can't meet remotely. The coronavirus means it might have to.,"A growing number of members of Congress — including Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the incoming White House chief of staff — have put themselves under “self-quarantine” after they came into contact with a coronavirus-infected individual at a conference of conservative activists last month. They’re unlikely to be the last lawmakers exposed to the virus as it spreads across the country: Members of Congress, like the rest of us, are vulnerable to an illness that knows no party lines. The House and Senate need to plan for an outbreak that sidelines a significant number of lawmakers for days or weeks.
Unfortunately, Congress is woefully unprepared for continuing its work during a pandemic. The Constitution requires both houses to establish a quorum — defined as a majority of members — to conduct business. Any lawmaker can issue a quorum call in her chamber, and if a majority is not present, then the chamber cannot enact any legislation until that threshold is again met.
Under House and Senate rules, only members who are present in person count toward a quorum. So if at least half of either chamber is under quarantine or otherwise unable to attend a session, the legislative process could come to a grinding halt right in the middle of a crisis.
That would be not only disruptive, but potentially disastrous. It’s quite likely federal agencies will need additional funds and additional authorities to manage the coronavirus outbreak. If either chamber falls short of a quorum, Congress will not be able to enact legislation responding to urgent needs.
The House — but not the Senate — has taken modest steps to prepare for a prolonged failure to establish a quorum. In 2005, with memories of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks still fresh, the House amended its rules to allow for a “provisional quorum” to conduct business if catastrophic circumstances prevent a majority from meeting. The provisional quorum procedure is cumbersome, though, and it would not allow the House to act quickly to respond to an outbreak.
Under the current provisional quorum procedure, the House first must summon its members back into attendance and wait at least 72 hours. Next, the sergeant-at-arms must prepare a “catastrophic quorum failure report” in consultation with Congress’s attending physician, the clerk of the House and public health and law enforcement officials. Once that report is delivered, House rules require an additional 24-hour wait before the depleted chamber can resume business.
By that point, at least four days will have elapsed without legislative action. Even then, the House cannot pass a bill without the concurrence of the Senate — which might not be able to meet at all, because it hasn’t followed the House’s lead in adopting a provisional quorum procedure.
The world is very different now than it was in 2005, when the House amended its rules. Video conferencing technology has reached the point that anyone with a smartphone and a cellular or wireless connection can participate virtually in a meeting. There is no reason the House and Senate need to shut down for days or weeks when all their members still can converse face-to-face from the safety of self-isolation.
The only impediment arises from the House’s and Senate’s own rules. The Constitution says that “a majority of each [house] shall constitute a quorum to do business,” but it doesn’t specify whether the majority threshold can be met by video conference. (Not surprisingly, the founders did not anticipate Skype and Zoom.) The Constitution also says “each house may determine the rules of its proceedings.” A fair reading of these two provisions is that if the House and Senate adopt rules allowing their quorum requirements to be satisfied by videoconference, those rules would bind.
The most directly relevant Supreme Court decision supports this view. In 1890, the House changed its rules so that members who are present but do not vote yes or no on a particular bill still would count toward a quorum. The Supreme Court upheld that rule two years later in the case of United States v. Ballin. As Justice David Brewer wrote for a unanimous court, the Constitution “has prescribed no method” for determining whether a quorum is present, “and it is therefore within the competency of the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably certain to ascertain the fact.”
Members of Congress may be reluctant to adopt rules that would allow for video conference meetings under ordinary circumstances. That lawmakers from different parties and regions congregate together in Washington — where they rub shoulders, slap backs and break bread — arguably contributes to collegiality and cooperation among their ranks. Partisan polarization on Capitol Hill during the past several years suggests that in-person sessions might not be accomplishing their objectives. Still, veneration for Congress’s institutional history — if nothing more — may persuade lawmakers that in-person meetings should remain the norm.
But these are not normal times, and they will become increasingly abnormal as infections and fatalities mount. Amended rules should provide for legislative sessions by video conference if the leaders of both parties, in consultation with public health authorities, agree that holding or traveling to an in-person meeting would pose unreasonable health or safety risks.
Video conference sessions should be limited to bills directly related to the emergency at hand, with the minority leader’s concurrence required before a matter is put to a vote. Thus, the Senate would not be able to use a video conference session to ram through a controversial judicial nominee. (The Senate should, though, provide an exception to the no-nominations rule for the unlikely event that a pandemic incapacitates so many jurists that the Supreme Court or a lower federal court cannot conduct business without additional confirmations.)
Some doubts still may linger about the legal validity of legislation enacted via video conference, even though the constitutional case for Congress-by-video is overwhelmingly strong. To quash such doubts as quickly as possible, the House and Senate should pass legislation allowing for a fast-track appeal to the Supreme Court of any case challenging the constitutionality of a statute enacted during a video conference session. The Supreme Court, which already has the capacity to hold votes remotely, could then affirm what already is apparent: Congress has the power to do this.
But what’s most important is that Congress act fast. Members still will need to meet once in person to amend their rules to allow for future video conference sessions. Both chambers are in session this week, but not the week that begins next Monday, March 16. By the time lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on Monday, March 23, the outbreak may have reached the point that an in-person meeting would seriously endanger many older members. (Twenty-seven senators and more than 60 representatives are above age 70 and thus particularly vulnerable to the disease.)
Continuity of government is a critically important element of crisis management. We need all three branches of the federal government to remain up and running even if — indeed, especially if — other sectors of society shut down. Congress is now a weak link, but it has a chance to fix that. It should seize the opportunity."
"March 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-health-insurers-urge-covid-19-treatment-testing/568629122/,StarTribune,Minnesota insurers offer more detailed guidance on benefits as coronavirus spreads,"Minnesota health insurers are offering more details about how they will handle coverage related to coronavirus testing and treatment, including more pledges that out-of-pocket costs will be waived for diagnostic tests.
The assurances mean that people in some employer plans will have coverage for testing that is like what has been promised by the federal government in the Medicare health insurance program.
Even with the assurances, cost questions remain for those who lack health insurance altogether, as well as for people with high-deductible health plans who might obtain health care services beyond just the test.
""The outbreak is certainly exposing gaps in both the kinds of coverage people have as well as the adequacy of the coverage that they have,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University. ""Obviously, a huge issue is the fact that we have close to 30 million people who don't have any insurance coverage at all and, for that reason, may delay or forgo care.""
Among those with private insurance coverage, the rise of health plan deductibles in recent years means that patients ""could face pretty high cost-sharing when they seek care,"" Corlette added.
Public health officials are monitoring the growing global outbreak of the respiratory illness called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by a new coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China. The Minnesota Department of Health on Sunday reported the second case in Minnesota.
Public health labs have been the only facilities equipped to test for COVID-19 and governments have been waiving any costs. There is no specific treatment for coronavirus.
Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group said Monday that individuals who feel they might have been exposed to COVID-19 should immediately contact their primary-care provider — and should try calling ahead ""to ensure safe and proper patient handling,"" the company that runs insurer UnitedHealthcare said in a statement.
America's Health Insurance Plans, the trade groups for carriers, said in a statement: ""Health insurance providers cover any reasonable, medically necessary health care costs related to infectious diseases and medical conditions, including COVID-19. ... Please review the terms of your specific plan for coverage details.""
It is within those coverage details that out-of-pocket costs can occur, as they do with treatment for other ailments.
Eagan-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota said that for those diagnosed with COVID-19, the insurer will waive all prior authorizations for diagnostic tests and covered services that are medically necessary and consistent with federal guidance.
Blue Cross, which is the largest health plan for Minnesotans, and UnitedHealthcare, which is the nation's largest health insurer, said they will waive cost-sharing for medically necessary diagnostic tests that are consistent with CDC guidance related to COVID-19. The decisions apply to ""fully insured"" health plans, which typically are offered by small and midsize employers, as well as health plans that the insurance companies operate in conjunction with the Medicare government program. Minnesota insurers HealthPartners, Medica and PreferredOne announced similar decisions.
The statements from the carriers don't fully address what will happen with testing coverage in ""self-insured"" health plans, which typically are offered by large employers that operate in multiple states. In 2017, about 38% of state residents in Minnesota were covered by self-insured health plans, according to state data.
Blue Cross said self-insured employers ""will have the flexibility to apply the same no-cost structure."" UnitedHealthcare said it was ""supporting self-insured customers choosing to implement similar actions.""
Insurance carriers make the decisions on benefits in fully insured plans because those employers have hired the insurance company to take the financial risk for the cost of employee medical claims. That contrasts with self-insured plans where employers are at-risk for claims costs, so carriers don't make decisions on covered services.
""Because there's so many different private and public payers, each of those will have their own policies,"" Lynn Blewett, a professor of health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. ""There's no one system that coordinates the response."" She added that about 240,000 people in Minnesota lacked health insurance in 2018.
Corlette of Georgetown said she expected most employers would cover the test as well as most related services. But depending on the employer plan, an assurance of coverage can come with a significant asterisk in the form of out-of-pocket costs.
""We've seen deductibles double in employer-based coverage,"" Corlette said. ""The average deductible is now well north of $1,000. ... A lot of families just can't afford to shell out that much.""
Minneapolis-based UCare doesn't work as an administrator for self-insured employers, so the health insurer has a simpler message to send about COVID-19 coverage. In a statement to the Star Tribune, UCare said: ""We will waive all copays, coinsurance or deductibles for doctor-ordered COVID-19 tests meeting CDC guidelines for members in all of our plans, for the immediate future.""
Blue Cross said it would help with ""access to prescription medications by waiving early medication refill limits on 30-day prescription maintenance medications [consistent with member's benefit plan] and/or encouraging members to use 90-day mail order benefit."" As part of its pledge on prior authorizations, Blue Cross said it would make dedicated clinical staff available to quickly answer questions.
UnitedHealth Group said an emotional-support help line operated by its Optum division is available for anyone experiencing anxiety or stress following the COVID-19 developments. Health care providers in Optum's growing division with clinics, urgent care centers and surgery facilities are ready to help COVID-19 patients, as well, the company said.
""Our top priority is the health and well-being of our members and patients — and the safety of those who deliver care,"" said Dr. Richard Migliori, the chief medical officer of UnitedHealth Group, in a statement. ""While the situation is dynamic, we are committed to adapting and supporting those we serve."""
"March 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/a-straightforward-way-to-ensure-workers-idled-by-the-virus-still-get-paychecks/568668072/?refresh=true,StarTribune,A straightforward way to ensure workers idled by the virus still get paychecks,"The biggest threat posed by the COVID-19 outbreak is, of course, the health risks it poses. But that is not the only risk: Avoidance, social distancing and panic may have enormous economic consequences, large enough to significantly slow growth, push up unemployment and even tip the economy into a recession.
On this front, the most vulnerable people are low-wage workers in low-income households without paid leave. Many employers are already telling their white-collar workers to work from home. But low-wage workers such as janitors, food service workers and retail cashiers can’t work remotely, and they also often work for contractors with less-enlightened policies. If these workers are temporarily idled by specific quarantines, school closures affecting their children or workplace closures motivated by general social distancing efforts, they won’t get paid. Their families tend to have little savings and live in an economically precarious state even in good times. Without work, these families face near-term risks of intense economic hardship and possible eviction.
So we need a quickly implementable policy that will maintain earnings for those who most depend on them. Many of these workers will be employed but temporarily idled; others may lose jobs as their employers try to manage shocks to their own businesses.
Unemployment insurance (UI) is the first line of defense in a downturn. In fact, workers who are able and available for work but are barred from their workplaces or otherwise idled are often eligible for unemployment benefits. But the UI system is not ready for the scale of claims that could result, and some state systems may not be set up to accommodate quarantined workers or caregivers. Often, UI benefits aren’t paid for several weeks, but workers will need money before that. Moreover, many low-wage workers who are most in need of assistance have interrupted work histories that do not qualify them for UI benefits.
A better solution is for employers to continue paying workers directly during shutdowns. In most cases, employers will want the workers back once the threat of the virus recedes, and continuation of wage and salary payments will help meet these workers’ and their households’ needs while supporting consumer spending in the broader economy.
According the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 40% of private-sector workers paid below the median lack paid leave benefits. That’s about 23 million workers, with average hourly wages around $14. To help them through what we believe will be an extremely challenging period, we propose the creation of a temporary, national paid-leave program, funded by the federal government, for workers idled due to the coronavirus.
Here’s how it would work. Employers would continue to pay workers who are prevented from working by the virus, through direct deposits or paychecks in the mail. They would report this to their state UI system, which would reimburse them through tax credits or direct payments and would in turn be reimbursed by the federal government.
Based on our experience working in the Obama administration on UI expansions during the Great Recession, this would be administratively challenging, but manageable, especially with extra federal dollars to expand UI administrative capacity. The specific implementation might vary across states. For example, California already has a state paid-leave program and might find it easier to administer this program through that. But the idea would be to reimburse employers for paying their workers through their coronavirus-caused leave, with as little disruption as possible.
This program would need to be strictly time limited — it is not intended to be permanent. It would be tied to local health authorities’ or the CDC’s recommendations about prudent responses. It would be important to have two separate triggers: One when authorities recommend that sick or vulnerable individuals stay home, which would trigger benefits just for these workers and for affected caregivers; and another if authorities recommend that larger groups take these social-distancing measures, which would trigger benefits for everyone affected.
The program would provide an essential lifeline for workers. It would also support employers, many of whom recognize the hardship that shutdowns will impose on loyal workers but whose hands will be forced as quarantines reduce their revenue streams to a trickle. An assist from the government will help these employers do what they know is right and will make it easier to restart their businesses when the health threat passes.
Because so much more is unknown than known about the spread of the virus and potential public health responses, coming up with a reliable cost estimate for our proposal is impossible. But if half of lower-wage workers without paid leave can’t go to work, replacing their paychecks would have a monthly cost of around $20 billion. If quarantines are localized to particular areas, the cost would be much lower, but an attractive attribute of the program is that it would contract or expand with need.
Borrowing costs for the federal government are remarkably low right now, so the program would be inexpensive to finance. But even were that not the case, we’d still pull for this sort of intervention. Ripple effects from quarantines risk devastating our economy, as workers without incomes have nothing to spend. “Countercyclical spending” — temporarily ramping up government support in periods of economic disruptions — has a long and venerable track record of helping both economically vulnerable families and the broader economy.
As this crisis unfolds, the Trump administration will be forced to launch some sort of fiscal response to offset the economic impact of the virus. The question is: Will the measures it deploys be targeted to those who need them, or will it default to their knee-jerk, muscle-memory, tax-cut mode? Millions of households who are on the precipice of economic despair depend on policymakers getting this right."
"March 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/putting-the-stock-market-s-recent-wild-ride-in-context/568680552/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Putting the stock market's recent wild ride in context,"The wild turbulence of American stock market prices recently is less scary when we put it in a historical context and we understand the factors which influence their values.
Most important, the stock market prices do not represent the value or stability of our economy. Stock market prices always vary more widely than the output of the economy. Since 2010 stock prices (measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, or DJIA) have quadrupled while the economy has grown only 43%. Real wages during this period for many workers have barely increased.
During the horrible recession of 2008-09, stock prices fell by 50% while the economy shrunk by 2%.
A look at the stock market crash of October 1987 provides insight into how the stock market currently operates. In one day (Oct. 22), the market (again measured by the DJIA), fell 22.6%. This was the largest one-day decline in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Research on how shareholders reacted to the fall of prices revealed a significant difference between the behavior of individual shareholders (who we know as investors) and the fund managers (who make investment decisions for people who invest in their funds).
The majority of individual investors held their shares and waited for the market to rebound. Fund managers, however, did the opposite; they sold shares and contributed to the drop in stock prices.
This distinction means that the models we use to value corporate shares seem to explain only the behavior of individual shareholders whom we call investors. Fund managers seem to respond to other criteria or motivations. These decisionmakers should not be considered investors by our traditional valuation models.
Since then, the funds have increased their share of common stock ownership and individual ownership of shares has fallen. Currently, funds control about 75% of common stocks traded on American markets. This means that individual shareholders, whose behavior we think we understand, own only one-quarter. This is one factor contributing to share price volatility.
The second factor causing share price variability is the role expectations of future corporate profits (dividends or cash flow) play in models used to value shares. Our valuation models show clearly that growth projections have significant impacts on share valuations.
A share whose dividends are expected to grow 5% into the future is valued about 80% higher than a share whose dividend is constant (often called a preferred stock), all things being equal.
Varying this growth expectation, even slightly, therefore produces significantly different share price valuations.
A critic could say that such growth projections are just guesses and that no one really knows the future. This is fair, but the market takes thousands of individual valuations based on different growth expectations, and the result is somewhere in the middle. This fails, however, when someone or a group of stock buyers work in concert to control that middle valuation.
These expectations of future growth can be disrupted by unexpected events such as an epidemic. Even though the growth projections are intended to be long-term, such disruptions throw short-term prospects into disarray. The result is that the future becomes more uncertain and all growth projections fall.
A small drop in the projected growth causes fund managers to reduce their share valuations and therefore they sell shares they had valued higher in the past.
Notice that a drop in expected growth does not mean that the underlying economy is somehow weakening. Share prices fall while the economy’s output remains steady — further evidence that changes on Wall Street do not always reveal the underlying health of the economy.
This does not mean that a health challenge such as the current coronavirus does not negatively affect some firms and industries directly. Analysts correctly adjust these values down further than the average corporation.
A related valuation factor is the riskiness of a firm’s profitability. All things being equal, the higher the risk, the higher rate of return investors require and the lower the stock price. Estimates of these risks is even less certain than a firm’s growth projections. A small increase in perceived risk can cause share valuations to fall, again independent of the performance of the real economy.
The importance of growth projections, however, can have an even more important role in future debates about the nature and goals of our economy. A growing number of environmental activists and economists advocate a sustainable economy, one in which corporate profits would be stable, not expected to grow.
It is not difficult to imagine how such an economy would function. More challenging would be the road to get there if 50% (or much more) of our current stock market value is based on growth expectations."
"March 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/take-coronavirus-seriously-but-resist-any-tendency-toward-xenophobia/568679242/?refresh=true,StarTribune,"Take coronavirus seriously, but resist any tendency toward xenophobia","On March 3, the South China Morning Post published an article detailing the assault of a 23-year-old Singaporean student living in London. As he was being attacked, the student heard the word “coronavirus.”
It’s hard to miss the proliferation of panic across the world in wake of the latest virus. Facebook is also a hotbed of coronavirus-inspired racism. On a recent trip to Singapore, my husband and I were at the Orchard Center Holiday Inn. I posted a picture of the desk manager and me to Facebook. Immediately, one of my friends commented how he wouldn’t have let the desk manager be around us, much less touch me!
There’s more to the Western world’s hyperbolic reaction toward the coronavirus and the disease it causes, and it’s a false assumption to suggest the desk manager in the photo was sick simply because he was Singaporean. Facebook comments like this are a symptom of xenophobia, a much more pervasive disease than COVID-19 and, without first checking our own xenophobic behaviors, we’ll continue to view the coronavirus through a lens that dangerously fuels this xenophobia.
Before my most recent trip to Singapore, I got all my news of the outbreak from local CNN. With its constantly extraordinary updates — as if straight out of a Hollywood movie, an Australian truck full of toilet paper burst into flames a few days ago, apparently a result of bulk-buying — CNN always seemed to invoke Judgment Day. My husband and I had planned to take a cruise from Hong Kong to Singapore, but Celebrity Millennium canceled the cruise in response to the virus. We flew to Singapore instead. Family members begged us to come home, repeating similar comments to that paraphrased above. Against my family’s “well wishes,” we remained.
Every time we go to Singapore in February, we call up our friend, Eh Poh, to drive us from the Changi Airport to our hotel, and I always bring him a Valentine’s Day gift — usually American candy and a Hallmark card. This year when I asked Eh Poh what he wanted, his response surprised me: “Face masks and hand sanitizer!” Although it’s not the custom for Singaporeans to wear face masks when they aren’t sick, Singapore does not take the coronavirus lightly. When we arrived at our hotel, our temperatures were taken, and the hotel requires its employees to take temperatures before they come to work.
Outside, high-end shopping centers were devoid of customers, save for the sanitizer markets. Banners all over these manipulative markets read, “Fight the Coronavirus; sanitize for your protection!” Gripped by Western panic, I wondered if we should have listened to CNN. We avoided crowded bus stations and malls, and I felt like I had to sanitize everywhere I went! Luckily, a simple acts of kindness was all it took to realize that — shock, horror! — not everyone in Singapore was sick!
One afternoon, we were eating lunch next to a family at a neighboring table. The mother realized she had nothing to clean the table with. I gave her half my disinfectant wipes. The exchange inspired a new observation: Singapore was not acting nearly as delirious as it had first seemed — after all, we wipe tables down in America, too, regardless of COVID-19. Singapore is far more than the spread of a virus.
Yes, the coronavirus is a serious outbreak and, as with any outbreak, one should exercise reasonable caution, but there’s a difference between reasonable caution and outright cultural dismissal. Singapore’s government, by ensuring accurate transparency in the media, makes it easy for the public to maintain reasonable caution. The Minister of Health has 24-hour coverage of COVID-19 available online at www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19. The government even removes web pages that spread unscientific conjectures.
Singapore and other cultures that have been affected by the coronavirus are still full of healthy human beings. What I continue to hear from the TV, friends and family as a consequence of the coronavirus coverage is contradictory to what I had actually experienced in Singapore. Our reaction to COVID-19 has been ethnically and racially influenced. It is not a tool with which we can justify deep-seated xenophobic feelings."

When a politician or scientist or couch expert says, “It’s only the old and ill that die,” they are talking about me. The coronavirus threat has changed my identity from that of a father, husband, son, friend, pastor, alcoholic with two years’ sobriety and a slew of chips to prove it, to that of a comforting statistic. My new identity may soon be summed up on the news when they say, “It’s OK. He had underlying health problems.”
I’m not complaining about those who are young and healthy. When I consider my children and my wife, I, like many of you, thank God for their health. Three months ago, I would have said the same thing about my health. Unfortunately, that changed in January when I finally decided to go to the doctor and have the little red spots that had formed all over my skin, along with the new bruises that showed up daily, looked at. I found out that the blood platelets that keep all of us from bleeding to death had decided to take a vacation from my body. Most people have anywhere from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Mine were at 4,000, and there was a danger of blood seeping into my brain, ending my life.
The first time I was in the hospital, I was there for eight days. They ran tests and stuck me with needles, capping it all off with a bone-marrow biopsy. I was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called aplastic anemia. To put it simply, my stem cells are under siege, making it difficult for my body to produce platelets, as well as red and white blood cells. I have been hospitalized around 45 days since that diagnosis. I’m actually writing this article from a hospital room. There’s a truly stunning view of the hospital roof outside my window. With no white blood cells, my immune system is completely compromised, and every little infection that normal people fight off without even noticing brings me back to the hospital again.
The only cure for me is to have a bone-marrow transplant. The problem is, even though there are several matches for my transplant, in order for the transplant to go as well as possible I have to be free of infections, viruses and other diseases. Only then can I be admitted to the University of Minnesota’s Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Center. Last month this didn’t bother me. Now, though, the coronavirus is coming up behind me, daring me to wait longer.
If all goes well, I’ll be discharged from the hospital and self-quarantined to my house with a bag full of antibiotics and other drugs. Sadly, I’ve been told that the other things I need to stay healthy and get to my transplant are gone. The hand sanitizer, the antibacterial wipes, the masks that my family should be wearing, and the N95 respirators that I need to wear are nowhere to be found — someone actually stole a box of masks from outside my hospital room. Many of these items have been snatched up by the same folks who thank God they are not me.
Again, don’t get me wrong. I am grateful for those who are young and healthy. They should be thankful, for they are blessed. I just pray that when they give that thanks, they remember those of us who are terrified by what is coming. We are not simply a means to calm people’s fears; we are people who deserve compassion, mercy and dignity. I ask simply that you pray for the old and sick that they might get through this, that you leave a little hand sanitizer on the shelves for us, and for goodness’ sake, don’t take the N95 respirators from my hospital room. I need them because my family, who knows that I am more than a comforting statistic, needs me. They need the man who loves them dearly and desperately wants to continue to be their father and husband."

The airline, which is the dominant carrier at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, announced the cost-cutting measures Tuesday amid falling demand as people try to reduce their chances of catching the new virus.
Other major airlines have done the same in recent days. The air-transport sector is one of the hardest hit by the outbreak, with stocks having lost nearly one-fourth of their value since Feb. 20. On Tuesday, shares in Delta and other airlines rose about 3% amid a broader rally. Such dramatic action hasn’t been seen in aviation since the 2008-2009 recession, when many airlines collapsed, consolidated and went bankrupt.
“This is a fear event, probably more akin to what we saw at 9/11 than necessarily what we saw in 2009,” Ed Bastian, chief executive of Delta, said Tuesday.
He told investors participating in the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference, held virtually because of travel concerns, that the year started off strongly for Delta. Bastian added, “Two weeks ago, our revenue trajectory changed dramatically as the virus spread meaningfully outside of Asia.”
Delta’s bookings declined between 25% and 30% in that time, and the company is “prepared for it to get worse,” Bastian said.
As a result, the Atlanta-based carrier is reducing international-flight capacity, which produces about one-fourth of its overall revenue, by 20% to 25%. Delta’s routes over the Pacific to Asia, where the virus originated, will be cut 65%.
Its capacity in the U.S. will be cut 10% to 15%, primarily through a reduction in the frequency of flights rather than elimination of routes.
Many businesses have curtailed travel, eroding a profit center for airlines. Airlines have implemented flexible booking options, including waived change fees, to encourage leisure travel. And they have also cut fares, said Bob Mann, a consultant and former airline industry executive.
“It’s a lot of stimulated leisure traffic, which doesn’t pay as much as the business traveler,” Mann said.
Delta expects its airplanes to be only 65% to 70% full this month, well below the 86% level the airline experienced for all of 2019.
Delta is instituting a companywide hiring freeze and offering voluntary leave options, though it didn’t provide details on what that might look like for workers. It is grounding aircraft and may retire some of its older planes faster than previously planned. Together, Delta expects those measures will save $1.8 billion.
The airline also expects to save an additional $2 billion from lower fuel costs this year, resulting from sharp declines in oil prices.
Delta said it found an additional $3 billion in savings this year by deferring $500 million in capital expenditures, delaying $500 million of voluntary pension funding and suspending share repurchases. The company had $5 billion in capital expenditures and spent $2 billion on share repurchases in 2019. Its total revenue last year was $47 billion.
Delta also withdrew its full-year financial guidance Tuesday until further notice.
“Over the last 10 years, we’ve transformed Delta by strengthening the balance sheet, diversifying our revenue streams and enhancing operational and financial flexibility,” Bastian said. “The environment is fluid and trends are changing quickly, but we are well positioned to manage this challenge.”
Delta owns 11% of Korean Air, which warned Monday it is facing an existential threat if the coronavirus outbreak doesn’t calm down soon. Bastian indirectly addressed that situation on Tuesday, saying, “We think we’ve got some of the very best airlines in the world that we are investors in and we’ll continue to support them through this.”
United Airlines — which has the greatest exposure to the Asia market among the major U.S. carriers — was the first to initiate systemwide capacity cuts last week, trimming its international schedule by 20% and its domestic service by 10% in April. United’s two top executives said Tuesday they will forfeit salaries until at least June 30 to save the airline money.
American Airlines on Tuesday announced a 10% reduction on international flights through the peak summer travel season and a 7.5% reduction on domestic flights through April.
Southwest Airlines said last week it could take up to a $300 million hit in March as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Chief Executive Gary Kelly agreed to a 10% pay cut in the meantime.
Twin Cities-based Sun Country Airlines, which is owned by a private-equity investment firm, isn’t required to disclose as much financial information as its larger, publicly traded peers. The airline told employees late last week it was making surgical cuts to its flights, including suspending several routes to and from Portland.
A Sun Country spokeswoman said Tuesday that no additional cuts are currently planned. She added, “This is a constantly evolving situation.”
Sun Country is continuing to actively hire pilots but is curtailing hiring of positions not critical to the operation."

Still, some lawmakers were taking precautions.
Rep. Patrick Garofalo, R-Farmington, postponed a listening session on mining issues scheduled for March 31 due to concerns about coronavirus. “Out of an abundance of caution, we have determined it in the best interest of the community to postpone this listening session,” he said.
A doctor and state Sen. Matt Klein, DFL-Mendota Heights, said he is suspending face-to-face constituent meetings until further notice, citing concerns about elderly residents in his district who are most vulnerable to the virus.
At least one legislator, Sen. Jeff Howe, R-Rockville, was tested for COVID-19 after attending a Republican CPAC conference in Maryland where another attendee tested positive. He is confirmed negative.
Meanwhile House Democrats rolled out a package of bills on Wednesday in response to COVID-19, including a measure to require health insurance coverage of COVID-19 testing and treatment, as well as a proposal to make sure hourly employees like bus drivers are still compensated in the event of school closures caused by spread of the illness.
Democrats are also considering legislation to give the Gov. Tim Walz more executive authority in the event of a public health emergency and expand unemployment insurance and sick leave benefits during an outbreak.
“We want to keep Minnesotans safe. We are moving these bills and considering these bills as fast as possible,” said Speaker Melissa Hortman. “Things are changing on an hour-by-hour basis.”
As news of the University of Minnesota’s decision to cancel in-person classes in response to coronavirus spread throughout the Capitol Wednesday, staffers and lobbyists were wondering if the Capitol complex was next.
But lawmakers said they are waiting on word from the Department of Health before restricting events and in-person meetings in St. Paul.
“We have not reached a moment in time where our public health professionals in the state of Minnesota are recommending that we dial back access to the Capitol or the size of gatherings we attend,” Hortman added."

Trump said “we are marshalling the full power” of the government and private sector to protect the American people."
"March 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/ireland-and-britain-aren-t-part-of-trump-s-coronavirus-travel-ban-this-is-why/568740422/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Ireland and Britain aren't part of Trump's coronavirus travel ban. This is why.,"In a speech Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced a ban on travelers from Europe. This led to a lot of initial confusion over what Trump meant by “Europe,” and whether trade in goods was banned too (Trump said it was, but the White House quickly clarified that this was not the case).
Trump also said that the United Kingdom would be exempted from the ban, prompting a lot of speculation as to what exactly was going on. It turns out that the ban — and the exception for the United Kingdom — is not quite as arbitrary as it sounds. Trump’s ban extends to countries in what’s known as the “Schengen Area,” a region that includes most states that are members of the European Union (as well as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland). The Schengen Area does not include the U.K. nor Ireland, whose prime minister is meeting Trump on Thursday for the traditional presentation of a bowl of shamrock for St. Patrick’s Day. So what is the Schengen Area, and why has the Trump administration targeted it?
The Schengen Area is an area of border-free travel
According to the Department of Homeland Security, the travel ban will apply to “most foreign nationals who have been in ... the Schengen Area.” The idea behind the Schengen Area is straightforward. It is supposed to allow people to cross national borders between Schengen members without having their passports or identity cards checked. This requires a lot of trust between countries, since, for example, once someone has entered Greece, they are in theory capable of moving to Germany, Italy, France, Hungary or any other member country without anyone stopping them or checking who they are. This has led to the creation of a massive system of information exchange among member countries. However, when Schengen was being created in the early 1990s, the U.K. decided not to participate. As an island, it has a different understanding of borders than mainland European countries, and it was also suspicious of deeper integration with other European countries. Ireland had a common set of travel arrangements with the United Kingdom that it did not want to give up, so it too decided not to join Schengen (although the U.K. and Ireland shared information with Schengen after it became more closely integrated into the European Union).
The result is that it is possible, at least in principle, to travel across much of Western Europe without having your passport checked at the border.
Schengen did not really get rid of border controls
In practice, border-free travel was never quite as simple as the rhetoric suggested. States continued to maintain some control over their borders and conduct random spot checks. Recently, the politics of Schengen has become increasingly complicated, thanks to internal European disagreements about migration. When the Schengen Area was created, no one expected that Europe would have to deal with massive flows of immigrants and refugees. Wars in Libya and Syria, and pressure from people who wanted a better life in Europe for themselves and their children, changed all that. The result was that Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway reintroduced border controls in 2015, to try to stop migrants who had landed in countries such as Italy and Greece from entering their territory.
The novel coronavirus outbreak has led to a similar reaction. The rapidly growing number of cases in Italy has led other Schengen members to talk about introducing new travel restrictions to prevent the spread of infection. Austria has said that people can only enter from Italy (which borders Austria) if they have a health certificate showing they are free from the coronavirus that is less than four days old. Slovenia and Hungary are introducing strong restrictions too. Such restrictions are probably legal under Schengen, which allows for the temporary reintroduction of border controls under exceptional circumstances.
But that isn’t good enough for Trump
Trump, in his speech, blamed Europe for not being careful enough in introducing restrictions, saying that viral clusters in the United States have been “seeded by travel from Europe.” The rationale for the ban appears to be that border-free travel will allow the contagion to spread throughout the Schengen Area, and then jump to other countries such as the United States.
As political scientists such as Mara Pillinger have noted, governments are often enthusiastic to impose travel bans, even though there is a broad consensus among policy experts that they are costly, politically troublesome and not particularly effective. They are especially unlikely to be effective where a disease has already become endemic within a country, so that “community infection” is occurring.
Why then are some Schengen states restricting travel from other Schengen states, and why is Trump imposing a general ban on foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen Area? One plausible explanation might be that travel bans send a highly visible signal to voters that the government is doing something to stop the spread. That might be particularly politically important in the United States, where the government has not yet been able to test citizens for the novel coronavirus in significant numbers, let alone introduce significant targeted measures to halt the spread of the virus that causes the disease COVID-19. Though many Schengen Area states are likely to be very angry at Trump’s decision, the willingness of some of their fellow Schengen members to impose similar restrictions will make it hard for them to respond in an unified way. It will be particularly interesting to see whether states such as Austria and Hungary denounce the U.S. ban or seek an exemption on the basis that they are imposing restrictions, and whether Ireland will refer to the ban on its fellow E.U. member states in the prime minister’s meeting with Trump on Thursday."

But we are in an unusual moment. The coronavirus has exploded into a global pandemic. Stock markets have tumbled. The international trade that feeds so many Minnesota companies is taking a pounding.
On Thursday, a somber Gov. Tim Walz said he has shelved many of the ambitious plans he had for this legislative session and instead proposed leaving $1.2 billion of the proposed surplus untouched to serve as a fiscal firewall in what have become very uncertain times.
That is a decision as wise as it is difficult. Walz had hoped to use the projected boon to advance improvements in early childhood education, to renew his proposal on climate change and make progress on other goals.
“It’s not often you get a one-page budget,” Walz said in the news conference to announce his supplemental plan — a document that typically runs dozens, if not hundreds, of pages to detail proposed spending. But a new reality, he said, has made this a time of “tempered expectations.”
The needs could be great as Minnesota moves forward in the face of an epidemic whose scope and severity continue to escalate. Should Minnesota’s K-12 schools close? If they do, how will the many students who depend on school lunches get fed? What about the homeless population? Low-wage workers forced to stay home without pay? Veterans homes and nursing homes?
Events are canceling left and right, all leaving bits of economic wreckage in their wake. President Donald Trump’s travel ban on parts of Europe has added its own complexities. Updates from the Minnesota Health Department are a daily demonstration of the pressures regarding more testing, vaccine development, treatment, containment and more.
Walz rightly calls for restoring the $491 million to the budget reserve that was tapped in last year’s budget compromise. Brimming reserves are exactly what’s needed to maintain the state’s credit rating and provide stability. A robust bonding bill, as Walz is proposing, would also be a strong move, both to make needed improvements and maintenance, but also as a form of state stimulus as recession becomes more possible.
Such a frugal package will require sacrifice on all sides. Walz said he is giving up for now on proposals dear to him. DFL House Speaker Melissa Hortman said in a statement that Walz’s proposal was “reasonable and responsible,” and would make “needed investments while preserving our state’s fiscal stability and flexibility in a time of great uncertainty.” Hortman’s caucus had particularly sought expansive funding for early childhood education.
Sen. Majority Leader Paul Gazelka on Thursday appeared to be clinging to the notion of a significant tax cut this year. That would be a dangerous path at a time when state revenue is more likely to decline and when public health needs are on the rise. That is a legislative battle best saved until the current crisis has passed.
Overall, Minnesota is fortunate to have a set of leaders who early on committed to working with one another, despite often vastly differing agendas. That cooperation has been tested at times. It is needed now more than ever."
"March 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-testing-that-can-help-us-put-the-coronavirus-genie-back-in-the-bottle/568752702/,StarTribune,The testing that can help us put the coronavirus genie back in the bottle,"The genie is out of the coronavirus bottle and has officially arrived in Minnesota.
Although this particular genie is not easily seen based on clinical symptoms, fortunately, science has provided us with genie glasses. If you believe in that kind of thing … you know … science.
From a testing standpoint, viruses have always been hard to detect. They’re difficult to grow in a culture, like we often do with bacteria, and checking for antibodies against a specific virus is often imprecise, particularly early in an infection, when the body hasn’t had enough time to produce antibodies.
Then came reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, a lab technique that allows us to identify fragments of genetic material (RNA in the case of coronavirus) in a body fluid sample. Like giving a search-and-rescue dog a sniff of the victim’s clothing, a specific RT-PCR test has to be developed for each specific viral or bacteria: It has to be told what it’s supposed to be looking for. (Visit tinyurl.com/molecular-assays for more information.)
RT-PCR testing isn’t exactly new, but like so many other things in modern life, technological advances have made it much more accessible and affordable. In scientific terms, it’s a damn good test. It rarely misses a virus that’s there, and it rarely mistakes another virus (or something else) for the virus it was seeking. It won’t mistake influenza or strep throat for coronavirus. RT-PCR testing isn’t perfect, but it’s the best we’ve ever had.
Ideally, we would have made a lot of RT-PCR genie glasses before the genie actually arrived on our shores. The delay wasn’t because we couldn’t figure out the gene sequence of this new coronavirus. In a tribute to the stunning sophistication of modern genetics, scientists in China released the virus’s mug shot — its entire genome sequence — on Jan. 10, a month after they became aware of the infection (or so we are told, China being China).
An aside here for freaky cool genome science: Because RNA viruses mutate at a somewhat predictable rate, scientists can use mutations to estimate the age of a virus, like counting growth rings on a tree stump. A young virus will have few if any extra mutations. Scientists believe the COVID-19 virus was “born” no earlier than Oct. 30, 2019, and no later than Nov. 29th (tinyurl.com/coronvirus-genome).
This genome map provides the template for developing both vaccines and RT-PCR testing. When Germany flew 126 of its citizens home from Hubei province on Feb. 1, they PCR-tested each of them. Two of the 126 tested positive, and they were not among the 11 people with symptoms.
In medicine, we are trained to avoid testing in situations where the likelihood of finding anything is low. Routine testing for rare or low-likelihood diseases, or in healthy people, just wastes a lot of money and generates more testing for those inevitable cases where the test returns falsely positive. It rarely saves lives. Men do get breast cancer, but not at a rate that justifies routine mammograms.
All that is different with the COVID-19 virus.
At the beginning of the outbreak, when the virus was thought to be isolated to a single province in China, travel history screening was an incredibly cheap and powerful “test.” But as the virus continues on its worldwide tour, travel history will become an increasingly nondiscriminating test (example: “Have you or a close contact traveled to any one of the following 30-and-counting states?”). And thanks to widespread RT-PCR testing in other countries, we now know that our other test — signs and symptoms of an upper respiratory infection — has been a crude one from the beginning. It appears that a majority of those infected have either no symptoms or minor symptoms — and yet remain capable of passing the virus to others. Never mind that we are still in the midst of our winter cold and flu season, where COVID-19 impostors abound.
So now that we know travel history and signs/symptoms are no more than beer-goggle-quality tests, it’s time to break out the genie glasses: RT-PCR. If the airline industry alone stands to lose $100 billion, it could offer the Centers for Disease Control and state and private labs $20 billion to rev up RT-PCR production, and still save itself $80 billion.
I asked Joanne Bartkus, director of the Minnesota Department of Health’s Public Health Laboratory, exactly how does a RT-PCR lab “rev up” capacity? Is it more machines, more reagents (substances used in chemical reactions), more staff?
“Yes to all of those things,” she replied as she went on to explain the COVID-19 virus testing process.
Somewhat surprisingly, the RT-PCR test itself is the simplest part of the process: The samples are placed in a machine called a thermal cycler, and in 2.5 fully automated hours, the data is ready to be interpreted. The rate-limiting, most-tedious part of the process is getting the specimens ready for the cycler.
As test kits arrive from around the state, each sample must be “accessioned”: Information such as patient identifiers, location and ordering physician must be logged into the computer, and the sample must be tagged with a bar code. It might sound mundane, but imagine the implications of attributing a particular test result to the wrong patient. This is serious stuff.
Then comes the process of extracting the viral RNA out of the immunological fog of war found in any snot sample. In the beginning, the RNA extraction process certified by the CDC was labor-intensive.
“It really limited the number of samples we could turn around in a day, and that’s one of the reasons that initial testing was limited to individuals with known risk factors,” Barkus told me. “But as we move toward community surveillance, we’ll need higher throughput extraction methods,” and who could ever argue with “higher-throughput extraction methods?” Good news: On the day I spoke with Barkus, the CDC had just greenlighted a technical change that will allow 96 tests to be done in a platform that previously handled 24.
So things are heating up at MDH labs, and elsewhere, too, as the Mayo Clinic and private labs like Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp have all recently rolled out their own RT-PCR testing. Under normal circumstances, every new RT-PCR would need to be tested and approved by the FDA, but under emergency conditions like COVID-19, the FDA can loosen the reins and allow labs to internally validate their new test and get the FDA “seal of approval” later.
All of that, and the prospect of broader testing, is welcome news. Then we’ll have some real data to guide our containment strategy, rather than hunches and case reports, or the difficult, labor-intensive, gumshoe detective work by public health workers.
And then we’ll have a much better chance of putting this genie back in the bottle."

On Thursday, Target, which employs about 350,000 at its stores and distribution centers, said it would waive its absenteeism policy for hourly workers who stay home because they have flu-like symptoms or who may be unable to work because of school or day-care closures.
In addition, the company said it will provide 14 days of pay to employees who are placed under a mandatory quarantine. And for employees who contract the coronavirus, Target will provide them with 100% pay for up to 14 days.
On Tuesday, Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, announced similar changes to its employee benefits after a worker at one of its Kentucky stores tested positive for the virus.

Tim Walz proposes scaled-back supplemental budget, reserving money to respond to virus","Gov. Tim Walz proposed a scaled-back supplemental budget Thursday that leaves nearly $1.2 billion unspent, warning that state dollars should be used to expand public reserves, recover from emergencies and prepare for the coronavirus outbreak.
COVID-19, the illness caused by the new corona­virus, forced the Democratic governor to pare down his initial spending plans. Walz signed off on an additional $21 million Tuesday to respond to the virus, and he warned that millions more might be needed to combat the spread.
“There are going to be resources needed during this pandemic that it makes sense to me to leave those numbers on the bottom line so that we’re in a position to be flexible and react,” Walz said.
His proposal, an adjustment to the more than $48 billion two-year budget set last year, includes $257 million in supplemental spending through 2021. It would also use nearly $269 million more over the following two years. Some of the big-dollar items are natural disaster assistance, supporting student well-being, handling overpayments to tribes and additional staffing and overtime in state prisons.
In addition to the limited new spending, Walz wants to shift $491 million into the state’s budget reserve. That would replenish the fund after lawmakers chose to tap into the reserve to reach a budget deal last year.
One notable absence from Walz’s supplemental budget list was money for early childhood education, which has been a top DFL priority and an area Walz also wants to invest in. The governor said Thursday the situation has changed since he previously talked about spending goals, and he said it’s possible that hospitals could come to the Legislature in the days ahead and ask for more than $100 million in state aid to handle the virus.
Early childhood programs are something the Legislature will take up in the next budget year, he said.
Walz’s budget, however, does devote millions to farm accident prevention, transit safety, vaping prevention and improvements to how sexual assault exam kits are handled.
The spending plan is based on a prediction of surplus budget dollars. Last month state budget officials projected lower than anticipated spending and increased tax revenue would produce a $1.5 billion surplus, up from the previous $1.3 billion estimate. However, Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Myron Frans warned Thursday that the prediction could change as the economy slows.
Walz emphasized that the state should take advantage of low interest rates to pass a large public works borrowing measure, also known as the bonding bill. He previously rolled out his plan for a $2 billion borrowing package that included money to repair and improve water systems, university and college facilities and transportation infrastructure. Walz said that given the outbreak, he hopes legislators work quickly this year to pass a bonding bill and supplemental budget, “then get back home.”
“I’m very aware that they need to do their business,” Walz said. “But I think it just behooves all of us, that this is not a time to posture around issues that we’re not going to reach consensus around.”
Senate Republicans and House Democrats have highlighted differing priorities for the state’s expected surplus, but they have yet to release detailed tax cut or spending plans. They could also adjust their proposals due to the coronavirus.
Republicans have suggested a plan where Minnesotans would “get your billion back,” using the surplus to make a variety of tax cuts, including ending the state’s Social Security income tax and reducing the lowest tax rate.
Responding to the governor’s budget proposal, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, drew a connection between negotiations over the bonding bill and Republicans’ desire for tax cuts.
“Our key priorities are exempting Social Security income. And if that’s not something the governor wants to do, then why do we want to have a bigger bonding bill than what we normally do?” Gazelka said, noting that legislators could pass a “simple bill around $755 million” and leave.
However, he said Walz’s plan to leave money on the bottom line was a prudent choice.
House Democrats also lauded Walz’s caution.
“I think the governor’s budget is very responsible in light of our present circumstances,” said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, adding that she would also like to bolster the state’s reserves.
DFL leaders in the House have said they want to devote surplus dollars to young Minnesotans by expanding early education opportunities, child care and financial assistance for school lunches. While Walz’s proposal spends little on early childhood education, it would allocate more than $84 million, largely in 2022 and 2023, to increasing Child Care Assistance Program rates to help people afford the care. It would also increase child care grants by $2 million."

Heroic efforts, such as instituting worldwide isolation measures like those in Wuhan, China, and in Italy might still slow the spread — but the impact of doing that everywhere could be even worse than the disease. So the virus will traverse the world, probably infecting between 40 and 70% of the global population during its first wave.
This might occur over a painful six to 12 months, or it might be spread over a more manageable several years. Either way, once the first wave is done, the virus is probably here to stay. This seems scary, as if we are resolving ourselves to tens of thousands — or hundreds of thousands — of deaths in the United States each year. But it is very unlikely that things will remain that bad.
Established diseases behave very differently than novel pandemic viruses. Most important, when a disease becomes established, the age distribution of infection changes. Right now, the high death rate from the coronavirus is driven almost exclusively by the oldest cases: One study from Wuhan found that 81% of deaths as of Feb. 11 were in people over 60, and only one death out of 1,023 was in a person younger than 20. Because this is a new virus, everyone is susceptible regardless of their age. This means a 70-year-old is just as likely to be infected as a 7-year-old — and far more likely to die.
Compare this with an established disease like measles. Before a vaccine was licensed in 1963, nearly everyone got measles at some point in their life. In fact, because measles is so infectious, getting it was an almost universal childhood rite of passage. And because infection with measles confers lifelong immunity, adults caught the disease only under extraordinary circumstances (such as when it was reintroduced to the Faroe Islands in 1846, after an absence of 65 years).
We don’t know if infection with the novel coronavirus confers long-lasting immunity. If it does, then something similar will happen: Eventually, almost all adults will be immune, and new infections will be concentrated among children. Since the virus causes severe disease almost exclusively in older adults, this shift to a childhood infection would nearly, but not completely, eliminate hospitalizations and deaths from the virus.
But none of the coronaviruses currently common in human populations confer lifelong immunity, and there is a very good chance that SARS-CoV-2 won’t either. Still, subsequent infections with the virus will almost certainly be less severe than the first, as individuals accumulate partial immunity. This is similar to the incomplete protection you get when the flu vaccine is an imperfect match for circulating strains; you can still be infected, but the resulting illness is far less harsh. This partial immunity would have a similar, if less dramatic, effect on the age distribution of the disease, reducing illness and deaths in older adults.
A buildup of population immunity will also moderate the yearly impact of the novel coronavirus in less obvious ways. Epidemics are like fires: When fuel is plentiful, they rage uncontrollably, and when it is scarce, they smolder slowly. Epidemiologists call this intensity the “force of infection,” and the fuel that drives it is the population’s susceptibility to the pathogen. As repeated waves of the epidemic reduce susceptibility (whether through complete or partial immunity), they also reduce the force of infection, lowering the risk of illness even among those with no immunity. This simultaneous reduction in the number of people susceptible to illness and the force of infection is why the same strain of influenza that causes a devastating pandemic will later produce mild seasonal epidemics. Vaccination campaigns, even when inadequate to eliminate disease, will have a similar effect.
So there will be a time after the pandemic when life returns to normal. We will get there even if we fail to develop a vaccine, discover new drugs or eliminate the virus through dramatic public health action, though any of these are welcome because they would hasten the end of the crisis.
But a long and painful process may be in store first. The first pandemic wave might infect more than half the world’s population. It is not unreasonable to believe that 1 in 1,000 of those infected will die (since many infections will have mild or no symptoms, the death rate among identified cases will be far higher). Perhaps 10 times that number will be hospitalized. In the United States, this would translate to more than 1.7 million hospitalizations and 170,000 deaths over the course of the first wave. That is five to times as many deaths as we see from the flu in a year. If these deaths and hospitalizations occurred over six to 12 months, they would overwhelm the U.S. health care system, which has only around 1 million beds across the country. The resources needed to care for coronavirus patients would leave little left over to properly care for people with other conditions such as cancer, heart disease or serious injury.
This first wave alone will not get us to the point where COVID-19 becomes a disease of children. An infection rate of 50% would leave half of adults at risk in the next wave. But a reduction in susceptible individuals would weaken subsequent waves. For the sake of argument, let’s suppose the second wave infects 30% of the remaining susceptible population, which translates into infecting 15% of all adults over 60. Using the same assumptions as before, in the United States this would mean 51,000 deaths, about the same as a very bad flu season. That figure would decrease with each subsequent wave, as both the number of people susceptible and the percentage of these infected go down. Eventually, we will reach a point where COVID-19 deaths in the elderly are virtually unheard of — but this could take a decade or more.
Development of a vaccine would vastly accelerate this process. Even if we did not eliminate the disease, we could significantly cut its mortality rate in one to two years, rather than decades. Even without a vaccine, improved treatment and new drugs could substantially reduce deaths. There are countless efforts underway to develop vaccines and treatments, but these take time; pharmaceutical solutions may not be available fast enough to blunt the first wave of the pandemic.
One of the greatest challenges in the COVID-19 response is the massive uncertainty about how deadly the infection truly is. While a death rate of 1 in 1,000 is plausible, some estimate it could be 10 times as high. If this is correct, the path to the post-pandemic period becomes much harder, and efforts to develop treatments and vaccines even more important.
No matter how the severe the disease, it is still in our power to mitigate the impact of the first pandemic wave and hopefully stop it from overwhelming our health care systems. By staying home when we are sick, minimizing mass gatherings and reducing physical contact, we can dampen the epidemic, reducing the number of cases and the speed at which they occur. We can do so knowing that there is an end in sight — though it may be years in the future — and this once-dreadful disease will morph into a mild annoyance in the years to come."
"March 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/economic-fallout-from-coronavirus-is-also-hitting-farmers/568772942/,StarTribune,Economic fallout from coronavirus is also hitting farmers,"The beef cattle market has collapsed in the past two months. Milk demand is threatened by school closures. Pork prices remain stubbornly low.
The coronavirus pandemic is, unsurprisingly, hurting farmers.
“You know what’s happened to the stock market. Cattle market’s the same,” said Tom Revier of Revier Cattle Co. near Olivia, Minn. “It’s like catching falling knives.”
Beef prices had rallied thanks to surging demand in China after swine fever devastated that country’s hog population, but the rally ended with the coronavirus outbreak. Prices are down 21% over the past two months.
Revier has been shipping some 400 cows to market each week since November but not replacing them as usual. The farm, which finishes Black Angus cattle for its own branded beef, is running at about half capacity.
“When the coronavirus started, you started hearing rumblings of that, we were still buying some cattle, but we got pretty worried when it started hitting here, so we backed off bringing cattle in from out west,” Revier said. Declining beef prices are also a problem for dairy farmers, said Lucas Sjostrom, executive director of Minnesota Milk, since 10% of their income comes from selling old dairy cows for meat.
Milk prices also had rallied toward the end of 2019, but they have dropped almost 20% since mid-December.
Now dairy farmers face the prospect of school closures eating into demand for milk — schools account for 8% of milk demand — and exports slowed by “backups at ports all over the world,” Sjostrom said.
“A 100-cow dairy, for example, in the middle of January might have expected, after family living, a profit of $25,000 to $30,000. Now we’re back down to levels where they will probably be not even close to making a family living,” he said.
Pork producers haven’t been hit has hard by the coronavirus, with prices about where they have been for the past six months. But spring is the time of year when prices typically start to rise, said Dave Preisler, executive director of the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, and prices are not rising.
“Hog prices in China are about six times what they are here, so the demand is strong for pork. It’s just the disruptions in people movement and the whole supply chain being disrupted,” Preisler said."
"March 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/oil-s-epic-crash-reminds-farmers-they-are-also-energy-traders/568773292/,StarTribune,Oil's epic crash reminds farmers they are also energy traders,"Oil’s nose-dive is sending farmers a stark reminder: They also need to be energy traders.
Growers have become more vulnerable to energy swings over the past decades as nations from the U.S. to Brazil mandated the use of biofuels.
About a third of America’s corn crop is used in ethanol, while Brazilian millers can use as much as 60% of their cane to make the biofuel. Asia’s palm plantations and Europe’s rapeseed crops are largely dependent on biodiesel demand.
As oil suffers its steepest plunge since the Gulf War in 1991 and the coronavirus spreads across the globe, agriculture markets are feeling the pinch.
“Ever since farmers embraced and promoted ethanol and biodiesel, they have increased their linkage to energy prices,” said John C. Baize, an independent consultant who advises the U.S. Soybean Export Council.
“When energy prices were high, corn and soybean prices were also high,” Baize added. ‘Now with the collapse of oil prices, commodity prices also are low. One cannot accept the higher prices without also accepting lower prices now.”
Oil’s rout — caused by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia — is the latest blow to crop markets already hurt by a decline in demand because of the spread of coronavirus that’s keeping people at home.
Markets have become more tied together over the past decades and farmers need to watch everything from crude oil to the state of the global economy.
“The coronavirus and drop in crude will impact demand and economic activity, and this could be dangerous,” said Michael McDougall, a managing director at Paragon Global Markets in New York. “Farmers have to be cognizant of this.”
U.S. ethanol margins were crushed as cheaper crude makes the biofuel less appealing.
Ethanol futures seesawed through the week but ended about 10% lower than they were two weeks ago.
Shares in producer Green Plains Inc. lost half their value last week. Pacific Ethanol Inc., another producer, saw its shares drop nearly 40%. Archer Daniels Midland Co., which is trying to sell its dry ethanol mills, slumped more than 15% through the week.
“Destruction of U.S. demand is heavy on everyone’s mind right now,” said Jordan Fife, domestic ethanol trader at BioUrja Trading LLC in Houston, said.
Sugar futures slumped as lower oil prices boost the incentive for millers in Brazil to produce more of the sweetener at the expense of ethanol. Brazil may produce an additional 6 million metric tons of sugar this year, according to top producer Raizen.
Equities were also hit, with Brazilian sugar and fuel giant Cosan SA falling through the week.
This year’s recovery in sugar prices had already been threatened by slow demand and the sell-off in commodities due to the coronavirus.
Edible oils used in biodiesel production also took a dive.
The sell-off comes as agricultural chemical manufacturers are hoping to see a rebound after last fall’s wet weather hampered demand. Nutrien Ltd., the world’s largest crop nutrient supplier, tumbled more than 30% through the week. Shares in competitors Mosaic Co. and CF Industries Holdings Inc. slid more than 35%.
It’s not all bad news for farmers. Crop prices are still holding relatively well compared with oil, and lower energy costs will help.
Chris Robinson, managing director of agriculture and commodities at TJM in Chicago, is advising clients to take advantage of crude’s plunge to lock in diesel prices.
“At the end of the day, that’s the silver lining to being an energy trader/farmer,” he said."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has decided to keep running for the Democratic presidential nomination, at least through Sunday’s one-on-one debate with former Vice President Joe Biden. That means we can probably expect to hear more from Sanders about how wrong it was of Biden to vote, as a senator, for the 2008 bill establishing the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) — aka, the Wall Street bailout.
“Joe bailed out the crooks on Wall Street that nearly destroyed our economy 12 years ago,” Sanders said in a recent Fox News town hall. “These guys, after destroying the economy, they came to Congress ... and said ‘bail us out.’ ” The democratic socialist launched similar attacks on his 2016 rival for the nomination, Hillary Clinton.
As they say in Brooklyn: Enough, already. The truth is that support for TARP should be considered a basic demonstration of political maturity and pragmatism, not some sort of betrayal of the working class. The TARP vote reflects well on Biden, and poorly on Sanders, who joined with 24 other senators from the left wing of the Democratic Party and the far right of the Republican Party in opposition.
Some relevant historical context: The outgoing Bush administration and the Democrats who controlled both houses of Congress had few good options for dealing with a once-in-a-century global financial collapse. As experts from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department told the politicians, however, one sure way to turn the worst recession since the Great Depression into, well, another Great Depression, would have been to let the banking sector collapse and take millions of American households down with it.
The Obama administration inherited TARP and wisely administered it so that both banking and the auto industry were able to come back. Both of these economic pillars are much better positioned financially to withstand a major shock than they were in 2008, which is why, amid much discussion about the possible need to rescue various industries from the impact of the coronavirus, no one has yet mentioned Wall Street or Detroit.
Sanders is within his rights to continue seeking the nomination. But it is long past time for him to quit his campaign of vilification against Biden for what was actually a major policy success."

Amazon said Monday that it needs to hire 100,000 people across the U.S. to keep up with a crush of orders as the coronavirus spreads and keeps more people at home, shopping online. The online retailer said it will also temporarily raise pay by $2 an hour through the end of April for hourly employees. That includes workers at its warehouses, delivery centers and Whole Foods grocery stores, all of whom make at least $15 an hour. Employees in the United Kingdom and other European countries will get a similar raise. Amazon said this weekend that a surge of orders is putting its operations under pressure. It warned shoppers that it could take longer than the usual two days to get packages. It also said it was sold out of many household cleaning supplies and is working to get more in stock.

PG&E financing plan gains approval from court
Pacific Gas & Electric on Monday won court approval to raise $23 billion to help pay its bills over destructive California wildfires after Gov. Gavin Newsom dropped his opposition to a financing package designed to help the nation's largest utility get out of bankruptcy. The milestone reached during an unusual court hearing held by phone moves PG&E closer to its goal of emerging from one of the most complex bankruptcy cases in U.S. history by June 30. Newsom has said he fears P&E is taking on too much debt to be able to afford an estimated $40 billion in equipment upgrades needed to reduce the chances of its electricity grid igniting destructive wildfires in the future. The utility's outdated system triggered a series of catastrophic wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed so many people and burned so many homes and businesses that the company had to file for bankruptcy early last year.

Plans abandoned for huge Arkansas paper mill
A Chinese company has abandoned its plan to build a massive paper mill in southwestern Arkansas that had already been delayed by trade tensions. Sun Paper told Gov. Asa Hutchinson and economic-development officials in a letter dated Sunday that it would not move forward with its plan to build a mill in Arkadelphia, about 60 miles southwest of Little Rock. The company cited ""continued political friction and economic instability,"" and the coronavirus outbreak as reasons for walking away from the project. The announcement comes after Arkadelphia officials announced that the community was marketing the 1,000-acre site planned for the mill to other potential projects. The $1.8 billion mill was announced in 2016 but has faced uncertainty since then because of trade tensions.

French regulators fined Apple $1.2 billion on Monday for striking deals to keep prices high, in the biggest-ever such sanction by France's Competition Authority. The agency said Apple and top resellers agreed to align prices with Apple's own pricing for its iPads and some other products. The deals did not concern iPhones.

"March 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/citing-virus-u-s-chamber-calls-for-suspension-of-payroll-taxes-for-businesses/568833932/,StarTribune,"Citing virus, U.S. Chamber calls for suspension of payroll taxes for businesses","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday called for sweeping amendments and expansion of federal rules for payroll tax collection and lending to prop up American businesses during the coronavirus crisis.
The viral pandemic has created a ""temporary period of revenue disruption"" that has halted commerce in a nearly unprecedented way, said Neil Bradley, the chamber's senior policy officer.
The chamber, the trade group for tens of thousands of businesses of all sizes, wants the government to suspend collection of Social Security, Medicare and other payroll taxes for three months to save businesses $300 billion to deal with loss of income and disruption of business because of the spread of coronavirus in the U.S.
The chamber also wants the Small Business Administration (SBA) to quickly qualify companies for certain kinds of loans.
It wants the government to suspend a policy of local certification of disaster loan borrowers before submitting their requests to the SBA. The chamber also said small businesses should not be forced to prove that they could not get private loans before turning to the SBA, which guarantees that lenders will recover at least 75% of what they lend if borrowers default.
One local banker agreed streamlining was necessary to get money to stressed businesses faster than usual.
""We still have to do what's prudent, but it makes sense to help people at this time,"" said Christine Young, SBA program director for Choice Bank in Golden Valley.
Young said Choice Bank is already working with business borrowers of all types to adjust existing loan repayments because of the coronavirus, especially companies in the trade show, restaurant and entertainment industries.
Following what it said was the practice after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Great Recession in 2008, the chamber further called for creation of a federal lending and loan guarantee program for companies with over 500 employees.
The proposal envisions ""a set of credit facilities"" where big companies can borrow from the government or with government loan guarantees to stay afloat and maintain employment.
""Loans and loan guarantees are not a bailout,"" said chamber executive vice president Tom Quaadman.
Whatever must be done, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota stressed the need to act quickly.
""I believe Congress must provide prompt relief to business and workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak,"" Smith said in a statement reacting to the chamber proposals. ""We need to respond with urgency, and our top priority must be supporting people directly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.""
Bradley singled out importation of medical devices as needing to be guaranteed.
A massive economic stimulus program is necessary to protect businesses and workers, chamber officials told journalists.
The speed with which Congress and the White House might implement any of the chamber's policy recommendations or its 30 other detailed suggestions remained unresolved. The House passed a bill last week to address the virus pandemic. Senate debate on that bill and alternatives are up for consideration this week.
The employer payroll tax suspension is not part of the House bill. Bradley called it a necessity to keep businesses functioning and workers employed. Payroll taxes go mostly to fund Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare, health insurance for Americans 65 and older.
It is unclear how or when the $300 billion lost to the hiatus in payroll-tax collection would be repaid. But Bradley said he anticipated that Congress would ""make Medicare and Social Security whole eventually.""
For the moment, the chamber is hoping for big changes very soon to minimize the economic pain. The business group thinks it will get them.
Based on conversations with congressional and White House officials, Bradley said, there is ""an intense sense of urgency on the part of Democrats and Republicans that is growing daily, if not hourly."""
"March 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/if-possible-stay-home-minnesota/568845892/,StarTribune,"If possible, stay home, Minnesota","As Americans come to terms with the rapid spread of COVID-19, fear is a natural response.
Yet panic will help no one. Instead, it’s time to come together and commit to following the advice of health care and public officials. Start with staying home as much as possible.
Health experts worry that too many Americans are not taking the coronavirus threat seriously, instead adopting an “it can’t be that bad” attitude. But it is bad — as health professionals confirm and the Star Tribune Editorial Board has argued for the past month. Limiting contact with individuals is a critical step each one of us can take to slow down the spread of the highly contagious virus.
Of course the other well-publicized hygienic efforts matter as well — including thorough hand-washing and sanitizing frequently touched surfaces. And if your work or other legitimate needs require you to leave home — as is clearly the case with first responders and health care professionals — practicing social distancing is strongly advised.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) already had revised its COVID-19 guidelines from avoiding groups of 200 to 50, but on Monday the White House set that number at 10. This no time for large gatherings, even among friends.
Although it will cause significant hardship for business owners and their employees, Gov. Tim Walz appropriately moved Monday to close restaurants, bars and other venues where Minnesotans gather, although takeout, delivery and drive-through food sales can continue.
In additional to staying home, relying on trusted sources of information — such as the CDC, the Minnesota Department of Health, Mayo Clinic and M Health Fairview — is critical. Sadly, there is false, predatory and sometime dangerous material spreading online as fast as the virus itself. Beware of scams about phony cures, fake coronavirus test kits or “miracle” drugs.
As Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison has pointed out, state residents should be on the lookout for scammers trying to take advantage of the pandemic. He said fraudulent groups may pose as charities soliciting donations and that people should only donate to reputable organizations.
Price-gouging essentials like food and medical supplies may happen and should be reported to the state. Virus-related information for Minnesota consumers can be found at the attorney general’s office website.
Even with the emphasis on distancing, we should take care to try to care for those for whom social isolation can exacerbate loneliness and depression. Try to stay connected online or by phone.
Keep in mind that older family members, friends and neighbors are at a higher risk to become seriously ill from the virus. If you’re healthy and not at risk, follow the examples of some younger adults who are offering to pick up supplies and food for their elderly neighbors.
For more guidance on making smart decisions about daily behavior, be sure to check out the recommendations in the commentary “The best thing everyday Americans can do to fight coronavirus? #StayHome, save lives,” first published in USA Today.
We’re in this together, but for now the best way to contribute to public health is to stay apart."
"March 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/health-care-companies-race-to-find-test-to-quickly-detect-covid-19/568831652/,StarTribune,Health care companies race to find test to quickly detect coronavirus,"Responding to limitations in existing testing methods, health care companies around the world are racing to produce new point-of-care diagnostic systems that can quickly detect the presence of the new coronavirus.
All of the existing devices used to diagnose COVID-19 cases, including Roche’s system heralded by President Donald Trump on Friday and a second one from Thermo Fisher Scientific, are laboratory-based systems that require sophisticated analyzers in major hospitals and labs.
Like other systems to detect the virus, the Roche and Thermo Fisher systems are known as RT-PCR systems, for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. That means the systems diagnose a viral presence when it reacts to specific snippets of genetic material.
Such systems can be highly accurate, but they often require hours to generate a result and another 24 to 48 hours if the patient’s sample needs to be transported to a central lab for processing. Patients may continue spreading the virus during those time lags.
There’s also a biological delay. The COVID-19 virus takes more time than past viruses to build up enough genetic material to be detectable with a lab-based test. That means a person may be contagious before the virus is detectable with traditional systems.
“Usually, you’d be able to detect it pretty close to when symptoms appear, for most viruses,” said David Deetz, CEO of St. Paul’s Ativa Medical, which is developing a point-of-care test that is still months from commercial release. “That’s why no one can contain this thing. … You become contagious early and can’t detect it until late. That’s the main problem.”
More than a dozen companies, including Ativa, are working on point-of-care systems that could offer rapid early detection of the virus, said Divyaa Ravishankar, a global product marketing manager with Ohio-based medical research organization NAMSA.
Other companies working on point-of-care systems include California’s Nanomix, Washington-state based InBios International and New York-based Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Ravishankar said. North Carolina’s BioMedomics is working to get FDA approval for a Chinese-made test that reportedly can deliver a result in 15 minutes.
Ravishankar said money has been “unlocked” at major funding agencies to help smaller firms accelerate development of COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including the federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the National Institutes of Health and the Gates Foundation.
No point-of-care system to detect COVID-19 is approved in the U.S. today. But like other point-of-care tools to detect illnesses, a quick test for COVID-19 would likely offer a trade-off between accuracy and speed, Ravishankar said.
Such a system could offer a result while the patient is still in the clinic, or standing in the entryway at a nursing home. Eventually it could be available over the counter at pharmacies, like an HIV test.
The result would not be definitive — people who test positive with a point-of-care test would likely need a full lab test to confirm the result, similar to a pregnancy test. But patients would at least know they need to take action until the definitive results are available.
“Most of the point-of-care systems are typically like a screening tool,” Ravishankar said.
Kris Ehresmann, director of the infection disease division at the Minnesota Department of Health, said Sunday that the public has gotten conflicting messages regarding testing for COVID-19.
“The goal for everyone to have access to testing is aspirational,” Ehresmann said Sunday. “The global demand for many of the components that are necessary to test for it is obviously extremely high. … We’d like to have more testing, but it is really not possible.”
In the United States, the first COVID-19 test available was a RT-PCR kit sent out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The diagnostic kit included a critical component that has since come into short supply, which is an RNA extraction tool made by a company called Qiagen. (Thermo Fisher announced March 3 that it intends to acquire Qiagen in a deal valued at $11.5 billion.)
Dr. Ashley Haase, head of the Microbiology and Immunology Department at the University of Minnesota, said once the RNA is extracted from a patient’s sample, it is transformed and amplified so it can be tested for specific snippets of genetic code using a PCR system.
“We’ve all been using these kits for RNA extraction for any number of kinds of research,” Haase said. “It’s easy to imagine that as the number of kits expands exponentially, that you may get shortages of some of the components.”
On Friday, President Donald Trump announced that the Food and Drug Administration issued an “emergency use authorization” to the Switzerland-based Roche Group to begin selling its real-time RT-PCR test, in which patient samples are fed into Roche’s fully automated cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 systems. Roche says the system can provide 96 test results in about three hours.
Soon after, Massachusetts’ Thermo Fisher Scientific announced its own FDA emergency authorization to run a COVID-19 diagnostic test on its Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx real-time PCR system. The test is designed to produce results within four hours of the lab receiving the patient sample.
But interest in development of a rapid point-of-care test will continue to build as the U.S. outbreak rolls on through 2020.
Dr. Mark Schleiss, a pediatrician at the University of Minnesota with a focus on infectious diseases, responded “Heck yes!” when asked whether the medical community would embrace point-of-care testing for COVID-19.
“What a boon it would be to have this for COVID-19,” he said via e-mail. “It would be enormously valuable.”"

The fund is set to provide assistance to hundreds of Target Center employees who are “adversely impacted by the loss of games at Target Center” as the NBA season is suspended because of the coronavirus epidemic.
The Wolves had to work through some red tape to set up the relief fund as several others around the league pledged to help their workers.
In the Wolves’ situation, they do not employ or pay a lot of the workers at Target Center, which is operated by ASM Global. Food vendors are under control of Levy Restaurants.
Taylor, who also owns the Star Tribune, and his teams have worked over the past week to clear the hurdles necessary to set up this fund through the teams.
“Our staff who work so hard to make the Target Center experience memorable for fans are the backbone of what we do,” Taylor said in a statement. “From the people who show fans to their seats, to the greeters at the entrance, I want to do my part to alleviate financial concern that come from missing games due to the national pandemic. We will get through this difficult time together and look forward to the day when our players, fans and staff are reunited again at Target Center.”"
"March 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/are-minnesota-s-hospitals-ready-for-covid-19/568877162/,StarTribune,Are Minnesota's hospitals ready for COVID-19?,"A key measure Minnesota lawmakers approved this week before radically ratcheting down operations due to COVID-19 was eminently sensible. They passed $200 million in emergency aid to help the state’s health care system meet the heavy demand expected from the pandemic.
Minnesota was reporting 60 cases on Tuesday, but the exponential increases in infections caused by this new coronavirus strain has overwhelmed medical centers in other countries. China built a 1,000-bed hospital in a remarkable 10 days. In Italy, patients are housed in tents and hallways, and shortages of critical equipment, such as ventilators for those are seriously ill, are widespread.
The measure passed by Minnesota legislators is no guarantee this won’t happen here. But it will help hospitals procure equipment, bolster staffing, convert existing rooms into intensive-care units if necessary and maintain critical cash flow during a disruptive time. Long-term care facilities, whose residents are at high risk of COVID-19 complications, will also be able to tap into these dollars. Rep. Tina Liebling, DFL-Rochester, and Sen. Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, merit praise for their quick work on this.
The assistance package boosts peace of mind during this difficult time. So does the knowledge that state medical centers have been preparing for a pandemic for years. That said, the unknowns about this new viral disease remain unsettling and have the potential to upset even the best-laid plans.
“What we are dealing with in COVID-19 is very unprecedented,” said Kris Ehresmann, the Minnesota Department of Health’s infectious disease director, during a Monday media briefing. “Despite all that planning and preparedness, it’s likely we will have challenges. Many things we are doing and dealing with have not been dealt with in the past.”
Minnesota Hospital Association President and CEO Dr. Rahul Koranne had a blunt and honest response when asked about state medical centers’ ability to handle a large surge of COVID-19 patients. “We can’t completely say ‘Yup, everything will be just fine no matter how big the surge is.’ ”
Staffing, room capacity, potential equipment shortages and limited COVID-19 testing are a concern in Minnesota just as they are elsewhere, he said. The health care system is working diligently with the Minnesota Department of Health to address these concerns and procure equipment from the federal government’s national stockpile.
But Koranne also emphasized that Minnesotans have a vital role to play in hospitals’ ability meet surge demands.
What is known suggests that roughly 5% of those who become ill with COVID-19 will need intensive care and another 15% will need hospitalization. If Minnesotans, through social distancing, staying home and other sensible measures, can keep the number of infected people low, then the health care system should be able to meet the needs of the 5% who need ICU care and 15% who need hospitalization.
“It all depends as a society, are we going to come together and will we agree to be inconvenienced? If we go about thinking it’s not that big a deal for me and we keep going out and about, then we might be looking at an enormous surge and then the health care system is not going to be able to bear that,” Koranne said. “The time for Minnesota to act is right now.”
That message bears repeating. Your individual risk may be low for COVID-19 complications. But taking precautions is critical to protect older Minnesotans and prevent a precipitous strain on hospitals and health care providers. This state is fortunate to be home to world-class medical centers, and right now they need everyone’s help."

Tim Walz signed a sweeping $200 million package Tuesday to help state hospitals, first responders, long-term care providers and pharmacies respond to the growing spread of the novel coronavirus.
The aid package was passed unanimously in the Minnesota House and Senate in predawn votes. The votes were the final acts of lawmakers before recessing for up to a month in an effort to slow the global pandemic.
“Our health care facilities are Minnesota’s first line of defense against COVID-19,” Walz said. “I am proud of this urgent, bipartisan action to support our state’s health care infrastructure during this unprecedented public health event.”
The funding includes a $50 million infusion into a health care contingency account and $150 million in grants, administered by the state Department of Health, to respond to the outbreak. Health facilities can also use the funds to set up treatment beds or to quarantine those who test positive for the virus.
“We must ensure our health care providers have the resources they need to take care of Minnesotans who may be afflicted with COVID-19,” said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park. “These investments are critical to addressing this pandemic and making sure Minnesotans who get sick get the care they need.”
Under the agreement, providers accepting grants must agree “not to bill uninsured patients for the cost of COVID-19 screening, testing or treatment.”
Senate Health and Human Services Chairwoman Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, said the spending plan includes accountability measures to make sure the money is spent only on responding to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Any unspent funds will be sent back to the state’s general fund.
“It is our mission to ensure that our impressive healthcare system is resilient in their response to an outbreak, and stable when the outbreak ends,” Benson said.
Wendy Burt, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Hospital Association, praised the lawmakers for expanding coverage for telemedicine, which will help hospitals accommodate patients who are well enough to receive care from home. Hospitals are preparing for a shortage of bed space.
Last week, the Legislature passed an initial $21 million boost to the health contingency account and planned to stay in session until mid-May. But the number of COVID-19 diagnoses in the state jumped dramatically over the weekend. That includes the first instances of community transmission, meaning the virus is spreading beyond those who had known contact with people who had traveled or tested positive for the virus.
Legislative leaders plan to continue to work as needed."

As if to underscore the severity of the situation, three of Ramsey County’s seven commissioners participated in the meeting by phone rather than in person, one because a family member was awaiting coronavirus test results. The four who attended sat with empty chairs between them.
“We are doing the very best we can, the absolute most in real time and around the clock to provide for all of our safety and well-being in this situation,” said Ramsey County Board Chairwoman Toni Carter.
At Tuesday’s Hennepin County Board meeting, where only 10 chairs were set up for the audience, commissioners ratified the state of emergency declared late Monday by Chairwoman Marion Greene. The county is shutting down 41 libraries, 18 human services hubs and 6 service centers until April 6.
The board also approved several measures to help ease the financial impact should any of the county’s 9,000 employees become ill from the virus.
“Residents already count on the county as their services safety net,” Greene said. “These are uncertain times. We all have to our part to weather the storm.”
The Hennepin board’s special $3 million appropriation will go toward finding housing and isolation spaces for quarantining the homeless or other vulnerable residents who either have the virus or are at high risk. The homeless population is of special concern since many likely won’t be getting tested for the virus and nearly 150 who go to shelters daily are senior citizens.
The board also approved $2.5 million for virus-related expenses. The county has set up an emergency operations center, limited conference travel, restricted meeting sizes and encouraged employees to work from home.
Similar action was taken Tuesday in other metro counties.
In Anoka County, all face-to-face services were closed until March 30 at human service and licensing centers, libraries and park buildings. Dakota County officials will close all in-person services starting Wednesday and continuing through at least April 1. Facilities closed to the public will include administration centers, libraries, licensing centers and park facilities.
Washington County will suspend all public-facing services at libraries, service and license centers from Wednesday through March 24. Carver County suspended walk-up services Tuesday through March 27, and Scott County closed all county buildings starting Wednesday, to continue at least though April 1.
‘Scary and stressful’
The Ramsey County Board approved the use of $1.8 million from its general contingency account to set up two new quarantine and isolation facilities for homeless people battling the coronavirus. Officials did not indicate where the facilities would be located.
The Ramsey board suspended nonemergency walk-up services through March 23, including at government centers in and near downtown St. Paul, the St. Paul CareerForce Center and county libraries.
It also gave County Manager Ryan O’Connor the authority to spend up to $1 million per contract on his own, without board approval. Ordinarily the Ramsey County manager may spend no more than $175,000 on contracts without board approval.
Commissioners who listened into the meeting by phone included Victoria Reinhardt, who was self-quarantined as a member of her family awaited coronavirus test results, and Commissioners Jim McDonough and Mary Jo McGuire, who stayed home because they weren’t feeling well.
The first case of coronavirus in the state was identified in Ramsey County on March 6. As of Tuesday morning there were 12 cases in the county, and county health workers were helping individuals in quarantine by providing face masks, thermometers and groceries, Hedin told the board.
Ramsey County Public Health Director Kathy Hedin tried to reassure leaders and the public that they were prepared for the pandemic.
“Many people will be able to recover from COVID-19 in their homes,” Hedin said. “We know that this is scary and stressful. Our public heath department has been planning for emergencies for a long time and we are here, we are ready and we are prepared to work with the community.
The Ramsey County Board chambers, typically full of staffers and members of the public, were largely empty save for a few county officials. Commissioner Trista MatasCastillo entered the chambers, sat down in her seat and vigorously rubbed her hands with sanitizer.
Officials said Ramsey County services will reopen on March 23 with redesigned approaches that reduce person-to-person contact while ensuring accessible and efficient service options.
Union pushback
During the Hennepin board’s open forum, several members of AFSCME, which represents thousands of county workers, voiced disappointment in the board’s actions for employees.
Ali Fuhrman, president of Local 2822, said library and service center workers were still being asked to come in and do busy work. Employees who may be sick are fearful of losing their jobs if they take time off, she said.
“People are already being paid, so why can’t they just work from home and get paid?” she said. “Why should you be penalized or put the public or your family members at risk?”
Hennepin County Board Member Jan Callison applauded Tuesday’s actions, saying they were “the right answers for today.”
“I didn’t like the ideas until I had to like the ideas,” Board Member Mike Opat said. “I was at a restaurant yesterday when the governor announced the shutdown of restaurants and schools. I could just see the pained looks on worker’s faces.”"
"March 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-covid-19-case-count-now-60/568864222/,StarTribune,Minnesota COVID-19 testing is restricted amid supply shortage,"Minnesota’s public health lab is restricting criteria for COVID-19 testing following a surge of activity that taxed its supply of kits and chemical reagents needed to confirm the presence of the corona­virus that causes the illness.
Testing by the state’s public health lab is now being reserved largely for hospitalized patients, health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, the Minnesota Department of Health announced Tuesday.
“We need to be focusing on testing those individuals for whom the positive results will make a significant difference either in their care or for our health care system,” said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.
The state as of Tuesday had conducted more than 2,300 tests and identified 60 cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December. Three cases so far have involved people whose infections couldn’t be traced back to recent travel or to other sick people, meaning that the virus is now spreading from person to person in Minnesota.
The state has responded with unprecedented restrictions to limit exposure to the virus, including the closure of dine-in restaurants, bars, theaters, fitness clubs and other gathering spaces, and the shutdown of K-12 schools that will start Wednesday and last at least until March 27.
Ehresmann said the reduced testing only increases the urgency for Minnesotans to comply with these mitigation steps and to stay home when sick. People with respiratory illnesses are asked to remain isolated for seven days after symptoms first appear or fever-free for three days, whichever is longer.
“Certainly the governor has made decisions and enacted things that limit people’s opportunity for exposure,” Ehresmann said, “but ultimately it’s Minnesotans themselves that need to comply.”
State and federal agencies faced public and political pressure to increase testing as well as criticism for initially restricting testing to people with symptoms who had traveled to China or other countries where the virus emerged. Testing in Minnesota surged after the state followed federal guidance two weeks ago and gave physicians discretion to request tests.
State officials were budgeting initially for testing capacity of as many as 100 patients per day or 300 per week, but their lab tested samples from 443 patients in a 24-hour period between Monday and Tuesday, according to the latest Health Department figures.
Asked whether opening up the testing criteria was a bad decision in retrospect, Ehresmann said, “there have been a number of decisions that have been made that we don’t have control over.”
Inconsistent messaging from the White House and President Donald Trump was part of the problem, as doctors followed his statement that “anybody that wants a test can get a test,” said Dr. Rahul Koranne, president and chief executive of the Minnesota Hospital Association.
“The health system responded appropriately and started testing more people and then we find out there is actually a shortage,” he said.
Gov. Tim Walz sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence last week, seeking an increase in COVID-19 tests. The state hoped to increase its capacity to as many as 15,000 tests per month.
Part of the problem is a global shortage of a chemical reagent that is used to extract nucleic acid from saliva or nasal samples to determine if the coronavirus is present.
However, alternative tests may soon be widely available due to a decision Monday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow new point-of-care and laboratory diagnostic tests for COVID-19 to go onto the U.S. market. The guidelines say test-makers need to independently ensure that the tests work and include disclaimers noting the test is not definitive and has not been reviewed by the FDA.
A Salt Lake City manufacturer is preparing to distribute its versions shortly, while St. Paul-based Ativa Medical said the FDA’s announcement may speed up manufacturing and eventual distribution of its point-of-care device and coronavirus test.
Mayo Clinic launched its own testing last week, but officials with the Rochester, Minn., health system did not reply Tuesday to e-mails about whether the global supply shortages would affect its criteria.
Testing by Minnesota’s public health lab is being reserved now for hospitalized patients, because positive results could make them eligible for antiviral drug studies that are underway in the race against this pandemic, Ehresmann said. Negative tests would allow hospitals to move patients out of rooms, such as those with negative air pressure, that are needed for COVID-19 cases, she added.
Test results of health care workers also could determine whether they must stop treating patients, and whether others in their clinics or hospitals may have been exposed.
Two patients told the Star Tribune they were screened via a visit to M Health Fairview’s OnCare telehealth portal and scheduled to go to a drive-through site to give a nasal or saliva sample. They received last-minute calls telling them not to show up, and M Health Fairview has since suspended its drive-through collection activities.
“I do not feel well … It could be due to something else but we really should be knowing what’s going on,” said a frustrated Lindsay Sandin, who was told not to go to the drive-through site in Brooklyn Park.
Health officials lamented the lack of testing. Koranne said more testing would provide early warnings to hospitals about when and where to expect surges of patients.
“The experience would have looked very different” with early, aggressive testing, he said, “but that is now behind us.”
Roughly 80% of COVID-19 cases result in mild symptoms, but people who are older and have other health problems appear particularly at risk for breathing problems and pneumonia that can result in the need for intensive care.
Ehresmann said she wants more testing as well, but the state can use its ongoing influenza surveillance as a proxy for whether the coronavirus is spreading. She added that the state will consider loosening restrictions if it receives more testing supplies and kits.
One positive, though, is that less testing means more people with mild symptoms will manage their illnesses at home and stay away from clinics and hospitals that can then focus on severe cases.
That, she said, could “ease some of the burden on our health care system.”"
"March 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/got-a-small-business-in-minnesota-that-closed-due-to-covid-19-do-this-next/568892842/,StarTribune,Got a small business in Minnesota that closed due to COVID-19? Do this next,"Tan Do has been in the restaurant business for 23 years and his Skyway Wok restaurant attracts many workers in downtown Minneapolis everyday.
But he closed it starting Wednesday for at least the next week or two. Few people stopped in Tuesday and even takeout orders didn’t come after downtown offices emptied and state leaders told restaurants to close to slow coronavirus.
“I’ve not experienced anything like this before,” he said. “I have no plan right now. We don’t know where to start.”
Across the state and country, millions of small-business owners are in the same position. Attorneys, accountants and other consultants said some of the hardest work for business owners comes after the decision to close is made.
“I’m advising my clients to get on the phone now and call the landlord to say ‘I can’t make April rent,’ ” said Stephen Cohen, a Minneapolis attorney who focuses on local and national restaurants. “Maybe the landlord or the small business calls the bank about getting a loan.”
Dawn Cardelli of Dawn M. Cardelli Tax & Accounting in Eagan has fielded many calls in the past week from clients grappling with closing dates and cash flow.
“We’re suggesting that some businesses contact the banker for low-interest loans for cash flow if that’s an issue,” she said. “They can contact suppliers about short-term payment agreements.”
Small-business owners may want to read their lease for a clause about circumstances beyond the tenant’s control.
“Have your attorney review it if you’re not sure,” Cardelli said. One option is to have April and May’s rent put on the back of the lease, Cohen said.
A lot of the negotiating may depend on the relationship between the parties. A small business with a supplier that normally has a 30-day invoice due date can ask for an extension.
“Communicate your needs to get some leeway,” said Justin Sundberg of Sundberg Tax & Consulting in Minneapolis. “Everyone is hungry for cash now.”
Small businesses need to stay in touch with customers to keep money flowing in, but they need to be creative, Sundberg said. If meeting a client at your home or theirs isn’t practical, reach for the phone or look into videochatting. Co-work spaces may be an option too, but many, such as Work It in St. Paul, are only serving existing clients.
And don’t neglect the small stuff. Stop services — from pest control to cleaning services — that may no longer be needed if the business is shut down. Turn down thermostats.
After calling the insurance agent about workers’ compensation, help employees with questions about filling out unemployment forms online. Newer employees may need the company address and phone. Advise them on choosing “layoff” or “layoff due to coronavirus” on the form, said one small business owner.
“This is a horrible time, but small businesses cannot allow the fear to paralyze them,” Cohen said."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-fed-chief-floats-forgivable-loans-for-small-business/568904022/,StarTribune,Minneapolis Fed chief floats forgivable loans for small business,"The head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis on Wednesday floated the idea of forgivable loans to small businesses, guaranteed by the government, to stem the tide of unemployment sweeping across a nation under lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.
More than 50,000 Minnesotans had requested unemployment benefits by Wednesday afternoon because their employers shut down to slow the virus. Social-distancing measures across the nation — shutting down restaurants, bars, theaters and salons — have put millions of people out of work.
In an interview Wednesday, Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, said forgivable loans are an idea he’s “brainstorming with other policymakers in the U.S.” The purpose would be to give businesses enough assistance to keep workers employed without saddling the businesses with debt they cannot repay.
“I don’t think a loan helps that much because, if you don’t have any revenue, how are you going to pay that back?” Kashkari said. “At some point these loans are going to have to be forgivable.”
An idea he said is “interesting” is for the government to make loans to small businesses, perhaps equal to their last year’s revenue, and forgive them if they manage to maintain their workforce through the downturn.
“So you go to your local bank, get an interest-free loan up to one times your revenue, and the government will guarantee that loan, and it’s forgivable if you maintain your workforce for a few years,” Kashkari said. “That would be much more powerful than pushing everybody on to the unemployment rolls and then have them take years to find their way back to being employed.”
Initial jobless claims are expected to spike in a report due Thursday morning and policymakers are wrestling with how to prevent a job-market meltdown.
New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin suggested on Wednesday that the government offer bridge loans to businesses, repayable over five years, on condition that they maintain 90% of their workforce.
When people lose their jobs it can take years to return to the workforce, a phenomenon that played out in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Kashkari, who worked for former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, was one of the key players in the government’s response to the financial crisis at that time.
“This is one idea that I’ve heard that sounds like it could be implemented at scale, and would create the right incentives,” Kashkari said."
"March 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/gas-prices-down-in-the-twin-cities-expected-to-go-lower/568901092/,StarTribune,"Gas prices down in the Twin Cities, expected to go lower","Gas prices in the Twin Cities are near a four-year low, and they are expected to keep sinking, particularly with the oil market in a free fall.
Crude prices hit an 18-year low Wednesday, and one prominent gasoline analyst said retailers have yet to fully pass down their savings to customers.
But there’s a rub for consumers. They have a lot less incentive to take advantage of low gas prices as the coronavirus threat has caused a virtual public shutdown and a mass migration to working at home.
The average price of gasoline Wednesday in the Twin Cities was $2.08 per gallon, down from a yearly high of $2.79 last April and almost at a four-year low of $2.06 that hit in January 2019, according to GasBuddy, a price-tracking firm.
In Minnesota as a whole, the average gas price Wednesday was $2.03 per gallon, lower than the U.S. average of $2.17. Minnesota’s five-year low was a brief period in early 2015 when gasoline prices sunk to between $1.40 and $1.50 a gallon.
“There is a lot of room for prices to go down further,” said Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis. “I think gas prices in the Twin Cities could fall another 50 cents.”
A price range of $1.40 to $1.60 per gallon is a “reachable average once gas stations pass on the full decline,” DeHaan said, referring to the steep drop in oil and wholesale gasoline prices.
“I don’t think I have seen a period where [retailers’ profit] margins are this big,” he said, adding that gas retailers’ margins conversely get pinched when oil prices rise quickly.
Jesse Hihi, owner of a gas station in Lakeville, said prices at Twin Cities gas stations could be much lower already. “It’s greed,” he said. “They are making a killing, these big gas stations.”
Hihi said he bought wholesale gasoline at $1.15 per gallon Tuesday and $1.10 Wednesday. His station, Hihi Market and Gas, had the lowest price in the Twin Cities on Wednesday: $1.49 per gallon, according to GasBuddy.
“I try to be the cheapest in the south metro,” Hihi said.
Other stations with the lowest prices in the Twin Cities on Wednesday afternoon, according to GasBuddy, were VP Racing Fuel in Red Wing at $1.53; a Kwik Trip and a Speedway, both in Lakeville, at $1.58 per gallon; Costco outlets in Coon Rapids and Maple Grove at $1.59; and two Kwik Trips in Red Wing at $1.64.
But even with low prices, gasoline demand has been partly destroyed by measures taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Hihi said there are seven restaurants within a half-mile of his Lakeville station, but they are shut down.
So the eateries’ customers and workers are not stopping to get gas like they usually do, he said.
The duration of the decline in gas demand hinges on the length of the coronavirus lockdown and to a lesser extent the lasting economic damage to consumers’ pocketbooks. A gasoline glut could build up, keeping supply high.
“Refiners will run their refineries as long as they can make money,” said Sandy Fielden, an oil-industry analyst at Morningstar. “And for a short time, there is a good incentive for them to run as much crude as they can.”
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil price, had been trading in a band between $50 to $60 per barrel for much of January and February, but plummeted into the low $30s last week.
WTI was trading just below $23 per barrel Wednesday afternoon. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark Canadian oil price, was going for $11 to $12 per barrel. WCS trades at a steep discount to WTI due largely to transportation costs.
The Twin Cities’ two oil refineries are big users of Canadian oil.
Oil prices fell this winter as the economic damage from coronavirus began sapping global oil demand.
Then the specter of a huge supply glut materialized within the past two weeks. Saudi Arabia opened its oil taps full-on, the result of Russia’s refusal to go along with output restrictions.
A rapprochement between the two would help tighten oil markets, DeHaan said, and it would make sense given the harm low crude prices can do to both countries’ economies.
“It’s not like they shot themselves in the foot, it’s like they shot each other right in the heart.”"

On Wednesday, the Minnesota Council on Foundations and the St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation announced its new Minnesota Disaster Recovery Fund, a nearly $4.4 million statewide fund backed by 28 foundations — from the Women’s Foundation of Minnesota in Minneapolis to the Blandin Foundation in Grand Rapids, Minn. The money will go to six Minnesota Initiative Foundations and other grant-makers to support residents, small businesses and nonprofits.
“The needs are obviously evolving in ways we could never have imagined,” said Susie Brown, who heads the Minnesota Council on Foundations. “We just want to be part of the solution.”
In St. Paul, the Otto Bremer Trust created a new $50 million fund this week for Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Montana nonprofits and organizations to help provide emergency funding, loans and lines of credit.
And in Minneapolis, the Greater Twin Cities United Way started a COVID-19 fund this week to support food and housing services for people in need, while the Headwaters Foundation for Justice is trying to raise $1 million this week to support community organizing and other efforts to advocate for sick leave and prevent housing evictions, especially among low-income people of color, who face wider health and education disparities.
Headwaters Executive Director Maria De La Cruz said the public health crisis is “shedding light on how our institutions … are not set up for people most impacted by oppression.”
Minnesota has more than 9,000 nonprofits with a record 385,000 workers, making up 13.3% of the state’s workforce, according to the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits. Many of those nonprofits help vulnerable groups — from older adults to a record number of homeless people. The coronavirus is hitting them especially hard as they cancel fundraisers and fear big donors will decrease giving after the stock market plunge.
Gov. Tim Walz ordered all Minnesota restaurants and bars to shut down on-site dining as of Tuesday evening. But on Wednesday, some chefs were back to work after Second Harvest Heartland, the state’s largest food bank, announced a $5 million initiative to pay now-shuttered restaurants to prepare meals for people in need. The initiative, called Minnesota’s Central Kitchen, so far includes three dining companies — Chowgirls Killer Catering, Restaurant Alma and the Bachelor Farmer. The takeout meals will be distributed by Loaves and Fishes, which has 30 dining locations in the state.
Second Harvest is trying to raise $5 million more to prepare and distribute 10,000 emergency food boxes to low-income people across the state. So far, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota has pledged $750,000 to both efforts, and Second Harvest CEO Allison O’Toole said she was “burning up the phone lines asking for help” from other contributors.
“It is go-time around here,” O’Toole said. “The number of neighbors in need facing food insecurity is growing rapidly. We’re seeing our numbers go through the roof. This is an opportunity for the entire community to come together to fuel this effort.”
Second Harvest, which relies on thousands of volunteers to help pack meals at its warehouses, shut down its volunteer center Tuesday due to the coronavirus outbreak and instead is buying more pre-boxed meals. The food bank delivers to food shelves, many of which are seeing double the demand from a week ago, O’Toole said.
Second Harvest leaders want restaurants and corporate cafeterias, which also shut down as companies shift to remote work, to donate food through Second Harvest’s MealConnect app — which links organizations’ surplus food to charities. The app, which is already getting unprecedented interest, was started a couple of years ago by Feeding America with $1 million from Minnesota-based General Mills.
In Minneapolis, the Greater Twin Cities United Way, which has canceled events through mid-April, is also fielding an increase in calls to its statewide resource hotline. Residents looking for food or housing support can text MNCOVID to 898-211 or call 211.
Rural residents, nonprofits and businesses may be affected more by the outbreak and the closures over time.
“Rural communities could lag behind a bit in terms of the impact, but it could be potentially more long-lasting because there are fewer resources,” said Diana Anderson, CEO of the Southwest Initiative Foundation in Hutchinson, Minn.
In Little Falls, Minn., the Initiative Foundation activated a Central Minnesota Emergency Relief and Recovery Fund, seeded with $20,000 from the foundation.
Nonprofits are also losing revenue during the outbreak.
From the Minnesota Historical Society’s sites to the Minnesota Children’s Museum and Science Museum of Minnesota, nonprofits have closed, losing admission revenue.
Spring is also a critical time for nonprofit galas and annual fundraisers, which are now in limbo during the outbreak, when large gatherings are prohibited. Some are getting creative. On Saturday, a masquerade gala in Minneapolis that was supposed to draw 700 people in support of the nonprofit Minnesota Independence College and Community moved online with a live video. It still raised more than $300,000.
Glen Fladeboe, a fundraising consultant, had 120 nonprofit events scheduled this spring that are now canceled or postponed. He said some nonprofits are still asking for donations online, concerned about declines in giving this year because of the outbreak and resulting financial crisis.
“The community needs to rally behind these nonprofits,” he said."

Ugly. The president, who considers himself a wartime president, said he will continue calling COVID-19 the “Chinese” or “foreign” virus against advice. This has led to a backlash against Chinese and acts of cruelty, intolerance and scapegoating against Chinese Americans, including the use by a White House official of the term “kung flu.”
Good. The head of the Centers for Disease Control warned such derogatory terms are scientifically wrong. Morally intolerable, as well."
"March 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/michael-r-bloomberg-the-economic-response-we-need-to-the-coronavirus/568931442/,StarTribune,Michael R. Bloomberg: The economic response we need to the coronavirus,"Never before has a public-health emergency created such widespread economic paralysis. As government officials work to slow the spread of the coronavirus, treat the afflicted, and save lives, it is essential that Congress and the president take immediate actions to stabilize a dangerously teetering economy and lay the groundwork for long-term recovery.
The relief bill spearheaded by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and signed into law by President Donald Trump Wednesday was an important first step in helping American workers hit hard by the crisis. Its main provisions — including creating temporary paid leave for many workers, extending unemployment insurance, and providing more funding for food stamps and children’s health insurance — will strengthen the nation’s social safety net.
But that must only be the start. All over the U.S., small and large businesses are closing their doors, and as they do, they are drawing down their lines of credit to pay their bills. Getting them help now is absolutely urgent — both for their survival, and to protect the financial system from the shock that is sure to come.
In 2008, Congress gave the administration and Federal Reserve authority to prevent a financial crisis from becoming an economy-wide catastrophe. Now, it must extend the same kinds of authority to prevent an economy-wide catastrophe from undermining the financial system that is essential to recovery.
Those emergency powers were wielded effectively by the Bush and Obama administrations, including using an exchange stabilization fund to guarantee money market funds, protecting millions of individual investors and ensuring that there is a market for businesses to issue commercial paper. Today, Congress must again move swiftly to give the administration the emergency powers that may prove necessary to hold the financial system and economy together.
Stabilizing the economy now and helping businesses survive must be priority number one. But providing immediate relief shouldn’t be the only strategy for achieving those goals.
In the months ahead, when the public-health emergency slows and hopefully passes, one of the fundamental obstacles to restoring economic growth will be public uncertainty. Consumers will not resume spending, businesses will not rehire workers, and investors will not leave safe havens until they are confident that we are on the road to recovery. In other words, the economic crisis that American communities will experience could far outlast the public-health emergency — unless Washington takes decisive action now to lay the foundation for recovery.
Delay will only prolong the pain. But swift action — by giving both markets and main-street businesses something positive to look forward to — can stanch some of the losses now and speed the recovery later, so that we emerge from this crisis a stronger nation.
One of the best ways to restore faith in the economy when the public-health emergency abates would be to ensure that it coincides with the largest public investment in infrastructure in generations. I know from my time as mayor of New York that public investment in infrastructure is a highly effective way to increase private-sector investment and business activity — and inspire confidence in the future.
At the same time, an infrastructure bill is a chance to build the clean energy economy our country needs — and to create the jobs necessary to do it. The bill should include major new investments in wind and solar power, a national transmission grid, energy efficiency for buildings, and the electric-vehicle manufacturing industry, which will benefit U.S. automakers. Those investments will create millions of new jobs, including for many Americans who lose work in the oil, gas and coal industries.
If Congress passes a major infrastructure and clean-energy bill before the April recess, shovels can start hitting the ground when workers, businesses and investors are looking for signs of hope, indications of growth, and reasons to believe that the worst has passed. And while it can take years to complete a project, the act of investment — and putting people to work — sends exactly the kind of signal to the marketplace that our country will need.
In my campaign for president, I outlined a comprehensive plan for repairing America’s existing infrastructure — 47,000 bridges and 2,000 dams require critical repairs, for starters — and modernizing it to reduce traffic congestion, cut pollution and carbon emissions, improve resiliency, and spur new economic opportunity, including by extending broadband to communities that don’t have it.
These kinds of investments were badly needed before the coronavirus began laying waste to our economy. Now, they are absolutely imperative. And while they will not be a cure-all — none exists — they will help restore faith in the future of the country at a time when we will badly need it.
We have seen this strategy work before. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt — himself diagnosed with polio, an epidemic that also led to closures of public facilities — declared, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” We have come to think of that famous utterance as referring to public fears about the Great Depression generally. But in fact, Roosevelt was referring to a specific kind of fear: the “nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.”
In the 100 days that followed, Congress heeded Roosevelt’s call and began converting retreat into advance. Now it’s time to do it again."
"March 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/here-s-how-two-experts-would-bolster-the-u-s-economy/568944382/,StarTribune,Here's how two experts would bolster the U.S. economy,"As terrifying as the spread of the coronavirus is, the speed with which it has shut down the U.S. economy has been even more shocking. Entire industries shuttered and almost every place where people gather closed in a matter of weeks.
Medical and economic recovery hinges on a terrible conundrum: The very measures needed to stop the spread of disease also inflict immediate and massive damage to the economy, along with the livelihoods of millions.
Accepting this, cooperating with even painful measures is vital. So too is the response of the federal government, which must take unprecedented action in this growing crisis. For all the differences this Editorial Board has had with President Donald Trump, his instinct to go big and fast is the right one and Congress should heed it.
And yet, some responses make more sense than others. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis, told an editorial writer that the economic response should be guided by a few key principles:
1. Help otherwise sustainable businesses stay afloat and keep workers on the payroll.
2. Speed and scale are of the essence. “People need help right now,” Kashkari said. To limit damage and hasten recovery, the government must act quickly.
3. Help individuals do their part to limit contagion. That means sick leave, unemployment coverage and cash assistance to help them keep their houses and pay bills even if they must stay home.
4. Stay flexible. Waves of assistance may be needed, Kashkari said, possibly until a vaccine is discovered. “No one knows yet whether lifting quarantines months from now would result in another outbreak,” he said.
Will this be costly? Yes. In fact, Kashkari said the $1 trillion package Trump is calling for may only be a first installment. But it’s an infusion that could help the country bounce back with minimal damage.
Thankfully, Trump’s initial proposal of a payroll tax holiday has faded. As Kashkari and others have noted, it would help only those with payroll jobs. That leaves out too many Americans. Trump had proposed using $500 billion to send checks to Americans in two installments — a move that could quickly add some certainty to an unstable situation.
A GOP bill emerging in the Senate Thursday also calls for direct payments, along with loans to large corporations and small businesses and corporate tax cuts that aren’t likely to win votes from Democrats. We’ll reserve judgment until a final bill takes shape.
Any bailouts to business should ensure that money is used to retain workers. Otherwise, unemployment insurance could be quickly overwhelmed. In Minnesota, which rightly relaxed requirements for unemployment, calls from recently laid off workers have flooded in at the rate of 2,000 per hour.
Economist Art Rolnick, a senior fellow at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs and a former vice president at the Federal Reserve in Minneapolis, said that federal resources should be focused on sustaining vital industries, such as airlines. Hotels, casinos, cruise ships? Not so much.
“That the market can sort out,” Rolnick said. “When demand returns, so will they.” In a pandemic, he said, “I worry about people. Resources should go to vulnerable individuals.” People need access to health care and help keeping their lives going in what he said hopefully could be a short — albeit sharp — recession. If that’s done, Rolnick said, when the pandemic recedes the pent-up demand Trump envisions could emerge.
Congress passed an initial $750 billion package. The proposed $1 trillion plan, depending on the details, would stabilize markets, provide a lifeline to Americans and prevent a deeper recession. Delay, right now, equals damage."
"March 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/dhs-needs-emergency-powers/568939352/,StarTribune,Minnesota Department of Human Services needs emergency powers,"This is an unprecedented moment for our state and our country with the spread of the potentially fatal coronavirus in our communities. To minimize the impact, we need swift and decisive action by our health care institutions, including the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS), which serves more than 1 million Minnesotans across all 87 counties and 11 tribes. Legislative action is needed to provide DHS the regulatory flexibility needed to protect the health and well-being of all Minnesotans and should be adopted immediately.
A key provision related to coverage of telemedicine for Medicaid enrollees was already passed and included in the $200 million coronavirus emergency bill signed by Gov. Tim Walz. Telemedicine allows for medical consultation for the most vulnerable, allowing those with chronic conditions to receive needed consultation in the safety of their homes. We applaud this swift action. But additional provisions need to be adopted to increase the opportunities for social distancing for DHS enrollees, which will help slow the virus transmission across Minnesota. For example, current regulations may require people with chronic conditions to make repeated trips to pharmacies every 30 days to refill their prescriptions. Language is needed to give Medicaid and MinnesotaCare authority to allow people to fill 90-day prescriptions, instead of needing to return to the pharmacy regularly for 30-day refills. Additional language could give DHS temporary authority to relax requirements for prior authorization from a physician in order for a medication refill to be approved.
These provisions are essential for those with the greatest need for medical visits and prescriptions, including the elderly and those with disabilities. DHS programs serve the most vulnerable among us, who are at greatest risk of severe health outcomes should they contract COVID-19. These steps are also critical to our front-line health care workers, to relieve burdens from clinicians at a time when they will be stretched thin. They also protect all Minnesotans by containing the spread of the coronavirus.
In order to flatten the curve, we need to make sure people who are showing symptoms seek out medical care and not wait until a crisis requires an emergency room visit. Health insurance coverage is key. Giving DHS emergency flexible authority for Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare eligibility decisions will make it easier for more people to gain and keep health insurance coverage that will encourage them to seek out care when symptoms arise.
Coronavirus transmission does not distinguish between the old or the young, the rich or poor, or who has health insurance coverage or not. Some 250,000 Minnesotans do not have either public or private health insurance coverage, including 50,000 children, creating the potential for further spread of this horrible virus. It’s imperative that the state use every tool available to ensure access to health care at this moment in time. DHS needs the flexibility in this time of great emergency to come up with innovative solutions in order to adequately serve the millions of Minnesotans who depend on it for services.
We urge the Legislature to grant DHS the ability to temporarily relax regulations in a range of areas including program eligibility, prior authorization and prescription coverage. This is not an abandonment of oversight but a swift and needed response to a crisis. The new authority is explicitly temporary and would expire 60 days after the conclusion of the governor’s declaration of a peacetime emergency. And, DHS would still be subject to compliance and reporting requirements under this temporarily expanded authority.
Minnesota has so far distinguished itself with its timely and careful responses to the coronavirus crisis. In the coming months, DHS will be the agency at the front lines of ensuring access to health care and other critical services for over a million Minnesotans. We need to ensure that the department has the ability to act quickly and decisively to slow the virus and minimize its effects. The Legislature should consider passing language to grant DHS the emergency flexibility it needs to combat the coronavirus."
"March 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-chamber-of-commerce-asks-for-tax-concessions/568911472/,StarTribune,Minnesota Chamber of Commerce asks for tax concessions,"The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce has asked Gov. Tim Walz for a number of economic concessions to help state businesses and workers withstand hits to income and disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The chamber called on Walz to extend deadlines for paying income, property and sales taxes and to delay or eliminate state licensing fees.
Late Wednesday afternoon, the state Department of Revenue announced plans to give a 30-day grace period to businesses on the payment of March and April sales and use taxes.
Some of the moves mirror expected federal policies meant to soften the blow of the fast-moving virus that has left federal and state officials battling to stem the spread of COVID-19, the illness that has killed thousands worldwide and stands to multiply exponentially.
As government officials close schools and limit gatherings of people in restaurants, theaters and sports venues, chamber officials said businesses will need the boosts in working capital provided by delayed tax payments to keep from laying off employees.
The chamber wants state tax payments of individual and business income taxes due in April delayed as long as the federal government extends its filing deadline. In addition, the chamber hopes Walz will push the May due date for property taxes back 90 days as people try to cope with lost business, wages and possibly layoffs.
No price tag came with the chamber’s recommendations. The strategy largely delays the state’s collection of revenue rather than cutting it.
The proposal also comes with a plea to declare an economic disaster that allows the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to make federally guaranteed, low-interest disaster loans to struggling Minnesota business.
One program that apparently would not be repaid would be a state fund that helps Minnesotans defray the cost of health insurance deductibles associated with treatment of COVID-19. Because the pandemic hit early in the year, many residents have yet to meet out-of-pocket payments associated with their policies."
"March 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/rapid-economic-shutdown-shocks-self-employed-independent-minnesota-workers/568930682/,StarTribune,"Rapid economic shutdown shocks self-employed, independent Minnesota workers","Freelancing and self-employment is like riding a wave as projects and jobs come and go. In the past week, the wave crashed as never before on millions of Americans.
Many Minnesotans who make a living on their own are now floating around in shock.
“You ride the wave. You have some months where you are busy and some months where you are not,” says Kelsey Shaw, who left a job at a marketing agency a year ago to become a freelancer who businesses hire to help them navigate social media and events.
“This is one of those months,” Shaw said. “However long this tunnel is I’m hoping to see the light.”
Freelancers, independent contractors, gig workers, “solopreneurs” and salespeople relying on commission have been the first to lose opportunities and income by decisions to close down large portions of the U.S. economy to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
Nearly 1 in 5 Americans work full time in such jobs, a figure that grew about 50% in the decade after the 2008 recession, federal jobs data shows. Another 10% of American workers get a second income by doing contract or gig work part time.
These jobs can be lucrative in good times and give workers a lot of control and flexibility in their lives. But when downturns come, they feel the pain first. Many independent workers are also on their own for employer benefits such as life and health insurance. Sick pay, for most, is no pay.
Eliana Reyes, who last year quit a job at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to devote all her time to work as a model, actor and filmmaker, is confronting the downside of self-employment for the first time.
“It was a leap of faith a year ago to quit my job,” she said. “Now with all my future bookings canceled, I’m somewhere between remaining calm and being near panic.”
Sierra Williams, who works as a doula, called a client Wednesday to say she couldn’t support her during labor because new coronavirus policies meant she couldn’t enter the hospital. Some hospitals in the region have limited the number of additional people in birth rooms or restricted access to in-house, on-call doulas, she said.
While she could ask clients to go to more accommodating hospitals, Williams said that could just add to the existing stress of giving birth.
“It’s already hard on me because I am an independent person and my checks come sporadically,” Williams said. “And I’m a single mother with five children so I’m trying to stay positive that this will end.”
Two weeks ago, a conference that Precious Wallace, a graphic designer and event coordinator, was scheduled to attend got postponed because of coronavirus. Then, Wallace heard from clients that events she was supposed to work on were canceled.
“It became a domino effect where people said, ‘Oh snap, we don’t know when this event is going to happen,’ ” she said. “It put everything on hold.”
But Wallace, who has been finding design work since she started making nightclub fliers at age 16, is optimistic that she can pivot. She has considered teaching design webinars and workshops.
“Unless you have retainer contracts you might have to find another way to get creative and make some money,” said Wallace, who owns King P. Studio and an events and community platform for women of color called Art in Many Forms.
Many gig workers and independent contractors will have to find their own way forward because they are not eligible for unemployment benefits from the government.
Anthony Kasper, a Minneapolis disc jockey who’s had full-time work for five years, said it’s unlikely that he’ll get new jobs at nightclubs, parties, and sporting events anytime soon. With two months of savings and little debt, he decided to make music instead of spin it.
“I create electronic music called drum and bass where I can make streams on Spotify,” Kasper said. “I can crank out an EP or two. It may not pay off right away but it’s something. I haven’t thought beyond two months yet.”
Paul Diethelm, a guitarist in St. Cloud who is a member of the eight-person Fabulous Armadillos group, has coped with losing gigs and income due to snowstorms, fire and venues that close. This shutdown is different, he said.
“Any of us in the music world are used to living month-to-month, week-to-week or even hand-to-mouth, but nothing to this degree. It’s like a natural disaster.”
He may get some musicians together and perform online with an internet tip jar. “I haven’t figured out the logistics yet,” he said. But he added, “We have a pretty loyal audience in Minnesota that I think are waiting for us to entertain them.”
Reyes said she’s forcing herself to get beyond the shock and think creatively. She’s considering social network posting of live monologues, acting scenes, reading her poetry, and singing.
“I’m thinking of things I do that I can put out to the world and hope that some will feel compelled to donate to me.”
Millions of other Americans are now working from home, a disruptive and isolating shock of its own, but those people at least will continue to see a steady paycheck.
“I hope that people will remember that while they’re consuming entertainment at home, there’s a whole industry of people … who have nontraditional career paths,” Reyes said. “These are not hobbies. They’re our livelihood.”"
"March 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/unitedhealth-group-shifts-to-work-from-home/568926592/,StarTribune,Minnesota medical groups have fits and starts with working from home,"UnitedHealth Group is letting more employees work from home, after saying on Sunday that many were expected to be in workplaces this week.
Fairview Health Services is struggling with work-from-home technology and telling many they can’t transition to remote work.
And at Medica, the health insurer is reporting success with shifting to off-site work for about 2,000 employees and contractors.
Work-from-home has so quickly become the norm for many in the novel coronavirus era that the transition sounds easy. In truth, the shift raises all sorts of tricky questions.
“Work-from-home is de facto creating a socio-economic disparity, although this might be an unintended consequence of the safety measure,” Maria Figueroa, a labor and policy researcher at Cornell University, said via e-mail. “The reason for the disparity is that generally lower-paid occupations require physical presence in worksites, particularly in blue-collar occupations, but also white collar.”
At UnitedHealth Group, the question has been: Exactly when do you widely push working from home?
The Minnetonka-based health care giant announced Sunday that many employees were expected to come to their assigned work location unless they were sick or self-identified as being at higher risk for the serious COVID-19 illness.
In a statement issued Thursday morning, however, UnitedHealth Group pivoted by saying that “over the next several days, we will begin enabling employees to voluntarily work from home if they are not serving patients in hospitals or clinics, or if their physical presence is not deemed essential to business operations.”
The company’s UnitedHealthcare division is the nation’s largest health insurer with 43 million subscribers, and its Optum division for health services includes clinics, urgent-care offices and surgery centers.
With the initial policy, chief human resources officer Patricia Lewis said in a memo that while “other, less essential industries have implemented broad work-from-home practices,” UnitedHealth Group needed to operate “as smoothly as possible during this health crisis to serve others.” The statement issued Thursday didn’t explain the change, but noted the company would “adapt our protocols and business practices in real time.”
On Monday, Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services issued a memo saying it had to limit remote working in order to reduce stress on its limited bandwidth. The subject line for the message read: “COVID-19: Limiting remote work for now.”
“All staff who normally work at our sites should continue to do so and not transition to working remotely,” according to a copy reviewed by the Star Tribune. “Employees who work remotely normally and who do not directly work with patients should report to a work location that is on the Fairview network and practice social distancing when possible.”
In a statement to the Star Tribune on Thursday, Fairview said it was adding network bandwidth every day. The health system said it has prioritized investments in people and patients “often at the expense of the broader IT infrastructure and digital capabilities that would accommodate the broad remote work environment we’re currently facing.”
It takes a lot of forethought and planning to dramatically expand work-from-home options, particularly at a time when many are trying to do so, said Robert Geyer, the chief operations officer at Minnetonka-based Medica.
Typically, about 600 Medica employees work remotely. By Wednesday morning, more than 1,800 employees were logged in to the company’s virtual private network (VPN), which still had plenty of capacity, Geyer said.
The shift didn’t require buying much hardware, since Medica recently replaced many company laptops and still had the old computers. The big challenge was to make sure security policies and procedures were in place, Geyer said, to protect patient data.
“This is kind of phase one, of getting people home,” said Lynn Altmann, vice president of human resources. “Now it’s about: How do we help people acclimate?”"
"March 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/gov-tim-walz-shelter-in-place-order-a-tool-in-the-toolbox/568940152/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz: 'Shelter in place' order a tool in the 'toolbox',"First there was the state of emergency declaration canceling large gatherings. Then came public school closures, followed by bars, restaurants, movie theaters and other public spaces.
But there’s one tool Gov. Tim Walz says he’s not ready to use to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in Minnesota — at least not yet.
The DFL governor said it’s not time to issue a “shelter in place” order, a dramatic measure already being deployed across all of California and being considered in New York City. It’s an extreme form of social distancing, slowing the virus by confining people to their homes except for essential business.
“I think what I would say to Minnesotans is: That toolbox that I told you I would open last Friday … that is one of them in there,” Walz said. “Last Friday we didn’t think there would be any need to close schools. Last Saturday we didn’t think there would be any need to close bars. So that’s the speed of this.”
Walz said he’s been in communication with the Minnesota National Guard about its role, but so far it hasn’t been deployed for response to COVID-19.
“Currently the Minnesota National Guard does not have imminent tasks related to prevention or response, but is in constant communication with the governor’s staff and state agencies should we be needed for future support,” said Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, Minnesota National Guard adjutant general.
If deployed, a shelter in place order would be the state’s most drastic move yet against the virus. The actions taken until now have already disrupted Minnesotans’ normal way of life, crippling businesses and idling tens of thousands of workers. Nevertheless, by Thursday Minnesota reached 89 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, and public health officials said they believe it is being spread by residents in every corner of the state.
Ryan Demmer, an associate professor in the epidemiology and community health division of the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health, said there’s never been a widespread shutdown of U.S. public life during a pandemic, but extreme social distancing efforts in places like China went a long way in slowing the number of infections.
“In the short run it’s one of our only tools. Staying away from people is going to be very powerful,” he said. “Social distancing, we know, is important and we should keep our options open moving forward with our eyes wide open and learn from experiences in other places. We should be watching what’s happening in San Francisco right now.”
Similar lockdowns have taken place in other countries, including Italy, Spain, France and China.
Officials from Portland, Ore., to Boston are saying such a mandate could be needed in the future. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently told residents to prepare for an order, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who would need to approve it, has rejected the idea. Similarly, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has said it’s not time for a shelter in place order, despite the urging of some. The Seattle area was the epicenter of the initial U.S. outbreak.
In California, shelter in place orders were first issued in northern counties and asked millions of residents to stay in their homes except for “essential needs” like grocery shopping, exercise and care for family members. Certain employees, such as health care and government workers, are also allowed to go to their jobs. But gatherings are barred, and law enforcement is asked to step in and enforce the order if necessary. So far, that’s meant minor fines for people or businesses who are not in compliance.
Thursday night, California’s governor asked the entire state to follow suit.
In Minnesota, an edict to stay home would likely face intense scrutiny from Senate Republicans, some of whom have already questioned Walz’s authority to shutter bars and restaurants and change unemployment rules.
“While we understand the necessity of Governor Walz to lead in this time of crisis, that leadership should not be unilateral and unchecked,” said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake.
But DFL Attorney General Keith Ellison said the governor is well within his powers under state law to protect Minnesotans.
“My office and I are working closely with the governor and state agencies to ensure that every executive order during this peacetime emergency has a solid legal and constitutional basis,” Ellison said.

"March 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-u-s-should-take-company-stakes-and-ban-buybacks/568965332/,StarTribune,The U.S. should take company stakes and ban buybacks,"“Trump Says U.S. Bailouts May Require Equity Stakes, Buyback Bans,” a Bloomberg headline screamed early Thursday afternoon.
The president had just finished a news conference in which he was asked point blank whether he supported the government getting equity stakes — and a ban on share buybacks — in return for giving taxpayers’ money to companies struggling with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus.
“I do, I really do,” he replied to a question about equity stakes. “Conditions like that would be OK with me,” he said when asked whether he supported a buyback ban as well as a freeze on executive bonuses.
It’s impossible to know whether this will be government policy going forward or whether the president will change his mind tomorrow — especially once he discovers that the biggest champion of these ideas is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The fact that Larry Kudlow, the administration’s chief economic adviser, had earlier broached the possibility of equity stakes gives me hope that the ideas might stick. They should. In fact, they’re the only sensible way to proceed.
Most Americans may not have heard the phrase “privatize the profits and socialize the losses,” but they certainly understand the underlying meaning. During good times, companies can reap billions of dollars in profits — and top executives can make millions. With income inequality widening and far too many service jobs paying minimum wage, the increasing wealth of the corporate elite can be galling. But when you add in the idea that these same companies run to the government for a taxpayer bailout when a crisis hits, well, that’s just infuriating.
Yet the government simply can’t allow the airlines, for instance, to collapse; they are too important. So it needs to rescue the industry, even if it means using taxpayers’ funds. From a purely financial point of view, the taxpayers should get a return on their investment, assuming airlines get back on their feet, which they surely will. But it is even more important psychologically. Without it, a bailout becomes a giveaway. In the current climate, that is unacceptable.
As for the buyback ban, well, you reap what you sow. Two years ago, Trump and the Republicans pushed through tax cuts that saved companies billions of dollars. The idea was supposed to be that the cuts would lead U.S. companies to invest, expand, hand out raises and so on. Instead, most companies bought back stock. Very smart people have raised stout defenses of this practice. But it’s another one of those practices that infuriates the populace — and the political class. Democrats have filed bills to curb the practice.
Consider airlines again: Earlier this week, Bloomberg News reported that “the biggest airlines spent 96% of free cash flow last decade on buying back their own shares.” American Airlines Group Inc., the article went on to say, had to borrow money to reach its buyback goal, repurchasing $12.5 billion of its stock.
When people see the airlines coming to the federal government, hat in hand, to request a $50 billion bailout — half of that in the form of grants — they think: Why weren’t these companies putting money away for a rainy day? Why were they so intent on rewarding shareholders instead of preparing for the day when the party ended? Why should they get aid when they were so reckless?
No doubt, corporate lobbyists will try to push back, but it’s a losing battle. Banning buybacks is a populist issue that appeals to both the left and the right. If the Democrats win the White House and the Senate — and hold on to the House — there is a decent chance that they’ll pass a law banning buybacks.
There is a famous story about a meeting that took place between President Barack Obama and the heads of the nation’s biggest banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis. They had all participated in the government’s bailout package, but the public was angry because their compensation was still in the millions.
They were trying to explain to the president why they needed to pay such high salaries. Obama stopped them cold. “Be careful how you make those statements, gentlemen,” he said. “The public isn’t buying it.”
Then he added, “My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks.” As we proceed with badly needed corporate bailouts, let’s hope executives are wise enough to realize that measures like buyback bans and equity stakes are the only things standing between them and the pitchforks."

“3M is receiving increasing reports of fraudulent and counterfeiting activities involving 3M products,” the Maplewood-based international giant said in a statement. “The company strongly condemns any unethical actions taken to exploit the global pandemic.”
The company has doubled global production of its highly coveted N95 respiratory masks to 1.1 billion a year (or 100 million a month), the statement said, and is working to get the new batches into the hands of hospitals and health care providers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.
3M is the latest Minnesota firm to ramp up manufacturing of products that can fight the virus. Protolabs in Maple Plaine and Wyoming Machine in Stacy are newly producing parts for ventilators, COVID-19 test kits and food packaging equipment.
For 3M, about 400 million of 3M’s N95 masks are currently manufactured each year in the United States. They are increasingly being directed to support both government and public health response, officials said.
The company also manufactures respirators at locations in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.
With the help of Congressional action taken this week, 3M expects to be able to route more of its mask to customers in the health care industry. Hospitals and first responders have talked about running out of masks and are predicting a shortage of ventilators in the U.S.
The company said it is now working with governments, medical officials, customers and distributors around the world to help get the supplies where they are needed most.
Besides masks, 3M boosted production of other COVID-19 related products including hand sanitizers, disinfectants and filtration solutions aimed at health care providers and for the pharmaceutical industry working to find a vaccine to fight the virus officials said.
“This pandemic is affecting us all, and we are doing all we can to support public health and especially our first responders and those impacted by this global health crisis,” 3M CEO Mike Roman said Friday in the statement. “We are mobilizing all available resources and rapidly increasing output of critical supplies health care workers in the United States and around the world need to help protect their lives as they treat others.”
On a down market day, 3M’s stock fell 9% to close at $124.89 a share Friday.
Other companies are racing to help during the pandemic.
Friday, the Maple Plain based robotic factory Protolabs announced it was rapidly making coronavirus test kits and ventilator parts.
“We’ve seen an influx of COVID-19 related medical components needing urgent production; ranging from test kits to ventilators to respirators,” said Protolabs CEO Vicki Holt. “We are urgently putting internal protocols in place to be able to prioritize these orders ahead of all others and waiving expedite fees in order to quickly get critical medical supplies into the market.”
Protolabs spokeswoman Sarah Ekenberg said Protolabs will ship 10,000 injection-molded coronavirus test kits Saturday and ship 100,000 more soon. The company is also making 100,000 ventilator parts for a large medical equipment firm and two ventilator prototypes for a major university.
The sudden rush of medical orders is being moved to the front of the production line.
“We are prioritizing projects which are needed to equip our medical system to treat patients with COVID-19 and providing these customers with additional consultative design assistance to rapidly get these parts produced,” Ekenberg said."
"March 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/target-bumping-pay-extending-sick-leave-donating-10m-to-coronavirus-causes/568964462/,StarTribune,"Target spending $300 million on pay raises, sick leave; donating $10 million to virus causes","Target is the latest retailer to roll out a $2 an hour wage bump for its 300,000-plus workers who have been working furiously to restock empty shelves and fulfill a deluge of online orders amid the coronavirus pandemic.
In addition, the Minneapolis-based retailer is adding a new benefit to give workers who are pregnant, 65 years old or older or who have underlying health risks (as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and don’t feel comfortable working access to paid leave for up to 30 days.
And it will pay out bonuses in April that range from $250 to $1,500 to 20,000 hourly store team leaders who oversee individual departments in stores.
In total, Target said it is spending more than $300 million in higher wages, bonuses and paid leave related to the coronavirus outbreak.
“We continue to experience incredible demand across our business, and Target’s ability to help our guests in this unprecedented time would not be possible without the strength of our team,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement. ”I am proud and humbled by the dedication and humanity they show to our guests every day.”
Target said the wage increase will last until at least May 2 for full-time and part-time workers in its stores and distribution centers, who will earn an average of $240 to $480 more during this time frame.
Target, whose current minimum wage for workers is $13 an hour, has pledged to pay its workers at least $15 an hour by the end of this year.
While other retailers such as Walmart and Amazon have said in recent days that they are looking to hire more than 100,000 people to handle the surge in their businesses, Target said it will hire additional people as needed after first offering extra hours to current employees.
Target’s moves are among a number of temporary wage increases and bonuses announced by grocery chains, Walmart and Amazon in recent days aimed at acknowledging the stress and risk their front-line workers have been under and will continue to face in coming weeks.
Target also announced that it would be giving $10 million toward relief efforts related to COVID-19, its largest ever donation to a specific disaster. That amount includes $1 million to a Target employee fund to assist workers affected by the coronavirus.
Cornell will donate an additional $1 million to this fund by selling some of his Target shares.
On Thursday, Walmart, which employs 1.5 million workers in the U.S., said it would spend $550 million on bonuses of $300 for full-time hourly workers and $150 for part-time employees.
Cub, Jerry’s Foods and Kowalski’s have instituted $2 per-hour raises for at least the next couple of weeks. Lunds & Byerlys is giving additional bonuses of $500 to full-time workers and $200 to part-time workers.
Like many other retailers, Target also has reduced its store hours to allow time for employees to restock shelves and sanitize stores.
It’s also placed quantity limits on some items in particularly high demand and has amended its paid sick leave and absenteeism policies in light of the pandemic."
"March 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/decades-of-economic-fecklessness-have-left-us-vulnerable-in-this-crisis/568978812/,StarTribune,Decades of economic fecklessness have left us vulnerable in this crisis,"There can be four kinds of business periods: true growth, challenges, synthetic and disastrous. As Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon has chronicled in his excellent book “The Rise and Fall of American Growth,” our nation is not and never was preordained to enjoy unlimited prosperity. Our prosperity has been influenced by demography, innovation, productivity trends, and by patterns in corporate, governmental and individual behavior.
In the sobering last chapters of his book, Gordon makes us aware of some significant headwinds facing the United States today. It is a highly informative read.
The decades following World War II did deliver true growth. Houses were built, cars sold, computers were developed and became reasonable in cost. Farsighted public policies, such as the interstate highway system and other infrastructure projects, helped make our economy both productive and efficient.
The late 1970s and early 1980s were more challenging, with intensified global competition, the emergence of duplicitous financial engineering, high interest rates, and shakeouts in many industries. But many of these challenges were met, as some of our most important companies responded with better products and services delivered at reasonable costs. Companies such as Nucor Steel helped to improve our effectiveness in key industries.
The U.S. economy has experienced periods of challenge again, after 9/11 and during the mortgage meltdown of 2008 to 2010. We got through those challenges, too, but it was not easy.
Unfortunately, the U.S. also has endured some significant periods of synthetic economics. Several of these synthetic periods were particularly harmful.
Missteps during the 1990s permitted too many mergers, coupled with lax enforcement of tax and financial regulations. All this laid the groundwork for the very serious mortgage meltdown and Great Recession.
We have made some of the same mistakes in the last few years. As our economy gradually recovered from the Great Recession, we threw gasoline on the fire of an already improving economy by coupling huge federal budget deficits with interest rates artificially held at very low levels. Deficits essentially tripled from 2016 to 2019 to exceed $1 trillion in a single year. Things seemed good at the time, as unemployment was reduced and the stock market surged to record levels. But several unfortunate consequences developed.
Companies and governments did not always make good use of the prosperity of these years. Corporate repurchases of stock surged. These stock repurchases fueled unrealistic stock market valuations for many companies — well beyond what the companies were actually worth.
One example might be my old employer, IBM. IBM was a well-managed and frugal company when I started with it in the 1950s. But during the last decade or so, it repurchased nearly $170 billion of its own stock, often at prices 50% higher than where the stock is now.
IBM’s balance sheet has correspondingly suffered. After its extensive share repurchases, and several costly acquisitions at premium prices, IBM now has a negative tangible net worth of around $52 billion — heading into a probable downturn.
IBM was by no means alone. Boeing, our nation’s largest exporter, has repurchased $55 billion worth of its own stock, leaving that company with a negative tangible net worth of $20 billion. Meanwhile, it struggles with enormous financial and legal problems emanating the disastrous handling of its 737 Max program. And it looks as if Boeing will now be facing this exceedingly difficult situation during a severe downturn triggered by the coronavirus.
Boeing and IBM have plenty of company. CVS, AT&T, Verizon, General Electric, Kraft Heinz and many other U.S. corporations have negative tangible net worth as the economy weakens. In fairness, other companies — Ford, Intel and several utilities, for example — have avoided these unsavory practices and are better prepared for more challenging environments.
The problem with synthetic economies is that their prosperity is illusory, as ill-advised financial practices are employed to present a picture of economic progress when the long-term competitive position of major companies, and the entire nation, have been seriously eroded. Meanwhile, executive pay and retirement packages have fed on the same synthetic illusions and grew well beyond customary levels — thus endangering broad community support for companies at a time when it may be needed.
Absent any inclination to critique their own behavior, corporations, public officials and citizens often lobby for more federal action during a downturn — usually suggesting even greater fiscal deficits and even lower interest rates. But, will there be consequences? For example, in the viability of retirement savings, pension funds and banks?
According to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, many of the nation’s pension funds are seriously underfunded and have been for many years. How are they going to fulfill their important obligations with near-zero interest rates?
And what about seniors who have saved for their retirement? When interest rates are arbitrarily reduced to below normal levels, is the action in any way similar to theft?
The British scholar John Argenti made an important finding in his landmark book “Corporate Collapse: The Causes and Symptoms.” He noted that through several identifiable stages of mismanagement, a company can become so marginal that normal business hazards can mean the complete collapse of even major corporations. Will this happen to some of our important companies? I don’t know, but the huge buildup of corporate debt is something that should worry us.
As problems associated with the coronavirus intensify, so has the clamor for safety nets and bailouts at a time when both corporate and governmental balance sheets are precarious. And where can the clamor for bailout end? Is anyone to be excluded from the generosity of a bankrupt and dysfunctional government? Are companies that might fail because they inappropriately bought back so much of their stock that they face insolvency entitled to the same largesse as companies that have behaved more prudently?
The economic slowdown that is apparently facing us is not a problem of the moment. It is the product of inappropriate policies, unwise business practices and compromised integrity dating back to the 1990s. These things produce predictable results. The solution to these problems will not fit neatly into the published propaganda of either our major political parties.
We need character, integrity, sound judgment and enough analysis to understand the deeper causes of our dilemma. It won’t get better by each party mobilizing its storm troopers."
"March 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/coronavirus-pandemic-now-we-ll-see-what-america-is-truly-made-of/568979062/,StarTribune,Coronavirus pandemic: Now we'll see what America is truly made of,"After the first of those oddly comical fistfights over toilet paper in grocery stores, and before the possibility of horrific battles over respirators in the weeks to come, I committed an act of coronavirus defiance.
I sat in a comfy leather chair in the neighborhood cigar lounge and lit a fine maduro cigar.
Why? Because I wanted to sit and think about all the things we’ll learn from now forward. And I wanted to say goodbye to the guys.
Just a few days ago they were worried about the FBI raiding the place again in pursuit of Chicago Way politicos. That was when we still shook hands.
All that’s changed for anyone with any sense of responsibility for others and themselves.
We’re at war with the virus.
You don’t need a rousing “Braveheart”-style speech. The virus doesn’t care about Hollywood-style drama. And you don’t need any more fearmongering and quivering lips. There’s been too much of that on cable news, to keep you locked in through commercials.
You just need quiet, and time to think. Here’s what I’ve been thinking:
If things are going to be as bad as the health professionals warn, can our fractured American culture handle what’s coming?
Those of you who have paid attention know that American culture has been systematically deconstructed by the left over the past decades. It was and is about power. Liberals won the culture war, took the universities and the media, and now frame the public discussion.
Yet now, in this time of crisis, with the old culture deconstructed and a new one not yet fully cemented in, what are the ties that bind a diverse people together and keep them strong?
A meme going around tells us that our grandfathers were called to war, and all we are being asked to do is sit on the couch and watch TV. There is longing for Roosevelt’s fireside chats and Churchill’s stiff upper lip. But are we still made of that kind of stuff?
Or have we become a silly people wasting time agonizing over who may have been insulted by someone calling it the “Chinese virus”?
The other day, the barking dogs of media and politics fought over whether some unidentified White House staffer tastelessly called it the “kung flu.” A few weeks ago, CNN anchors were calling it the “Chinese flu” and the “Wuhan virus” — you may have seen the video mashup. But now the act of calling it by the name of origin is a sin.
China doesn’t like it, and some media organizations are sensitive to China’s feelings. Disney and the NBA were sensitive when China became peeved with them. But the virus originated in China, and China lied about it for weeks. And calling it “Chinese” anything gets in the way of what many of them want to call it: TrumpVirus.
Remember what Rahm Emanuel said about never letting a crisis go to waste? Well, they’re not wasting it.
But if you’re in a hospital bed, with your face strapped to a ventilator, you really can’t hear the barking dogs. And those in a desperate struggle for oxygen probably don’t give two figs.
We’ve already learned much about ourselves with those infantile (and I mean it literally) fights over toilet paper in the stores. We’ll learn more, if shelter-in-place orders are backed by the National Guard and hospitals hire armed security to deal with fights over ventilators and beds.
Mexico doesn’t seem all that worried. They’re partying in great, happy crowds. But Europe has rediscovered the virtue of borders. In Italy, doctors are now forced to ration ventilators, deciding who lives and who dies.
“In Italy, they say pan di grano,” said my barber, Raffaele Raia, of Naples.
He explained that “pan di grano,” literally means “wheat bread.” The slang was born in Italy during World War II, when people starved. Hospitals were full and resources scarce. And doctors were forced — just as they’re doing now — to play God and decide the great mystery for those deemed unsavable.
Those who weren’t to be saved, like the elderly and the very ill, were given wheat bread. It made hungry people feel full and somewhat comforted at the end.
“So now,” Raia said, “in Italy, with so many sick with the virus, someone asks, ‘How is your grandfather?’ You could respond with, ‘Pan di grano.’ But you’re not talking about wheat bread. You’re talking about the end. That’s pan di grano.”
I do wish the churches were open. A good friend regularly attends services at her Roman Catholic Church. A week ago, she was there for her daughter’s confirmation ceremony. The priest applied holy oil to the foreheads of all the children, one after another, with the same cup and same thumb.
“I didn’t think much of it then,” she said. “But now I think, should I have scrubbed it off immediately? See how this has changed us?”
The great sadness is that churches, temples and mosques close just as people need them the most. But you don’t need a church to pray. Perhaps the best prayer of all is the simplest prayer I know, uttered by that lowly tax collector, his head bowed, kneeling, whispering, “Kyrie eleison. Have mercy upon me O Lord, a sinner.”
We will get through this. And along the way, we’ll learn exactly who we are."
"March 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-chinese-virus-label-isn-t-helping-anyone/568979192/,StarTribune,The 'Chinese Virus' label isn't helping anyone,"On March 16, President Donald Trump finally struck the appropriate tone and, standing alongside respected public health officials like Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, offered sound advice and real leadership on what Americans can and should be doing to combat spread of the coronavirus.
Sadly, that same day and the next he returned to his Twitter account to fire off two ill-advised tweets once again calling coronavirus the “Chinese Virus.” This is exactly the kind of divisive, stigma-causing language that the president’s own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned against in regard to the coronavirus and “persons of Asian descent.”
As many public health experts across the country have taken pains to explain, viruses don’t have nationalities, and they don’t discriminate when it comes to who can spread disease or become infected. Labeling coronavirus as a “Chinese” virus only contributes to the confusion and divisiveness in an uncertain time.
Texas alone is home to some 1.5 million people of Asian descent, more than 5% of our great state’s population. These Texans, many of whom arrived generations ago, are no more likely to test positive for the coronavirus or spread COVID-19 than any other Texan. That is to say unless, like Sen. Ted Cruz, they have come in contact with an individual who has already tested positive.
We wouldn’t call the president’s language “racist,” as some have. But we would agree with evangelical leader Eugene Cho, who tweeted this week that “Calling it the ‘Chinese virus’ only instigates blame, racism and hatred against Asians — here and abroad. We need leadership that speaks clearly against racism; leadership that brings the nation and world together. “
What would that leadership look like? Less than a week after 9/11, President George W. Bush stood side by side with Muslim American leaders and spoke these words: “This is a great country. It’s a great country because we share the same values of respect and dignity and human worth. And it is my honor to be meeting with leaders who feel just the same way I do. They’re outraged, they’re sad. They love America just as much as I do.”
Standing side by side with Asian-American leaders, Trump could deliver a similar message in a similar time of national crisis and uncertainty."
"March 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/feds-failed-on-covid-19-testing-readiness/568979082/,StarTribune,Feds failed on COVID-19 testing readiness,"Testing is everything in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. That’s been the consistent message from national and international leaders alike.
That includes Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, who in a media briefing on Monday said that “all countries must take a comprehensive approach. But the most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chain of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate. You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected.
“We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.”
That’s what Minnesota’s leaders would like to do. But they, too, are fighting the fire blindfolded due to the potentially deadly dearth of testing capacity. On Thursday, Kris Ehresmann, the infectious disease director of the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), said that with the six community-transmitted cases of COVID-19 at that point, “we have more COVID-19 circulating in Minnesota than our case numbers would suggest.”
Just how many remains unknown, creating “frustration” for Gov. Tim Walz and other Minnesotans who want to feel hope that the pandemic will be controlled.
The collective emotion should be anger as well. There are many tentacles to the testing backlog, which is but a subset of the broader problems in the federal response. Most notably, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined to use World Health Organization tests used in countries like South Korea, where testing rates far surpass those in the United States.
Despite President Donald Trump’s March 6 pledge that “anybody who wants a test can get a test,” mass backlogs exist. “I am concerned that national messaging from the White House task force regarding test availability in all states and accessible drive-up testing does not accurately reflect these critical shortages in Minnesota,” Dr. Rahul Koranne, president and CEO of the Minnesota Hospital Association, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Private industry has stepped up as fast as possible. The Mayo Clinic, among others, raced to develop a COVID-19 test. The federal government has sped up, too, but should have been better prepared.
The warnings were there. In fact, a chillingly realistic pandemic simulation run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last year “drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed,” the New York Times reported Thursday.
The “Crimson Contagion” exercise imagined a respiratory virus beginning in China and being declared a pandemic 47 days later. But a later response in the simulation resulted in these mind-numbing numbers: 110 million Americans infected, 7.7 million hospitalized and 586,000 dead.
Test, test, test, said the World Health Organization’s secretary-general. It’s clear that America is failing in that regard, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
Americans have every right to be angry. But they must also focus doing what they can individually to stay healthy and mitigate the need for tests in the first place."
"March 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/walz-executive-order-targets-covid-19-gouging-and-scams-in-minnesota/568973122/,StarTribune,Executive order from Gov. Tim Walz targets COVID-19 gouging and scams in Minnesota,"Gov. Tim Walz’s executive order on Friday barring price gouging during the COVID-19 pandemic comes amid a flurry of complaints nationwide about scams and soaring prices for essential needs for protection against the corona­virus.
State Attorney General Keith Ellison said his office received more than 150 reports of price gouging as of mid-Friday. His office has now deployed a 23-person consumer protection unit to investigate an upsurge in claims for miracle cures and suspected links to malware and price gouging on products like hand sanitizer, face masks and rice.
“The attorney general forecasted ... that while the vast majority of people’s basic human nature and decency would come through, there would be a few of those who would try and prey on people, especially the vulnerable, at a time of disruption,” Walz said.
Walz added that he’s seen hand sanitizer “averaged for $60 a bottle” and pitches hawking $1 squirts. “These things are real,” he said. “That’s not who we are. Many of them can come from out of state and this gives the state and attorney general the ability to crack down.”
His executive order takes effect at 5 p.m. Saturday prohibiting the sale of essential goods at “an unconscionably excessive price” of 20% or more than their cost before the coronavirus emergency. Violations could result in fines of up to a $10,000.
With Walz and Ellison urging the Legislature to take action, House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, said lawmakers are working to include price gouging legislation in a package of bills responding to the pandemic. State Rep. John Lesch, DFL-St. Paul, said he introduced a measure to ban price gouging in Minnesota after hearing from constituents about staples such as rice selling for as much as 200% higher than usual.
Stores, including Wisconsin-based Menards, have come under fire for doubling the price of household items like bleach and selling respirator masks at up to $40 per pair — more than four times what has been advertised elsewhere.
An Associated Press survey of attorneys general and consumer protection agencies this week found more than 5,000 reports, with hundreds more coming daily. On Thursday, the Justice Department ordered U.S. attorneys across the country to appoint special coronavirus fraud coordinators. Federal officials also activated a central fraud hotline at 1-866-720-5721.
Erica MacDonald, U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said Friday that she designated her chief of economic crimes to be the point of contact for all incoming reports of COVID-19-related fraud scams.
Attorneys general around the country have seen emerging scams taking advantage of news reports that the federal government is considering payments of up to $1,200 to many Americans, according to a spokesman for Ellison’s office. People are reporting fraudulent text messages made to look like “cash app” links that falsely say they are from the government, as well as deceptive — and sometimes threatening — e-mails and robocalls suffused with malware links demanding money or asking for names and Social Security numbers they claim are needed to receive their government checks.
Ellison is recommending Minnesotans not click on links in e-mails or elsewhere on the chance that they may contain malicious software. Officials also warn against seeking updates on the disease from nongovernment sources such as “suspect e-mails, sketchy websites, or social media posts from unknown origins.”
Ellison’s office also is investigating reports of Minnesotans receiving e-mails purporting to offer “miracle cures” or access to respirator masks and COVID-19 testing kits — both of which are in short supply nationwide.
This week, state lawmakers all received an e-mail titled “I have COVID-19 Test Kits + N95 Mask/PPE Supplies — PLEASE FORWARD.” The message linked to a Google Forms page for a purported medical device company promising to create “a bridge between what your state needs and what we have/can procure.”
At least one Minnesota lawmaker, Rep. Mary Franson, R-Alexandria, tweeted a link to the site, but it was soon flagged by House DFL staff as a scam. Franson did not respond to requests for comment.
Walz’s order defines essential goods or services as those necessary for “the health, safety and welfare of the public,” such as food, water, fuel, housing, health care goods, medical supplies and personal hygiene, sanitation and cleaning goods.
Beyond that, Ellison said he is pushing lawmakers to codify anti-gouging measures into law, as 30 other states do.
“I’m hoping that we just we really put some law in place regarding the anti-price gouging, hoping that the fact that it’s not lawful to do is enough to get people to not do it,” Ellison said."

Amy Klobuchar is in the mix for Joe Biden's running mate,"Former Vice President Joe Biden is now the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, so expect a couple of months of speculation about Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as a possible running mate.
At his debate on March 15 with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden pledged to pick a woman as his vice presidential candidate.
The next day, the Washington Post put Klobuchar second on a list of likely prospects behind California Sen. Kamala Harris. That echoes speculation by pundits and insiders who cite Klobuchar’s swift endorsement of Biden after she dropped out of the race ahead of Super Tuesday.
She did so, according to the latest campaign finance reports, with about $5.2 million left in her campaign coffers. In all, she raised and spent close to $50 million to run for president.
What would she bring? Her message of Midwestern electability (Minnesota is now considered a battleground state) and centrist views that echo Biden’s.
Her biggest obstacle? Many Democrats want Biden to nominate a woman of color.
Biden’s decision is likely still several months off, and for now the coronavirus pandemic has mostly pushed the presidential race out of the headlines.
For her part, Klobuchar has downplayed the veep chatter, saying she doesn’t engage in “hypotheticals.”"
"March 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-confirms-first-covid-19-death/568994732/,StarTribune,Minnesota confirms first COVID-19 death as cases grow to 137,"The steadily widening corona­virus outbreak in Minnesota has claimed its first fatality.
State health officials Saturday announced the confirmed death of a resident due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. They also disclosed more severe disease among those hospitalized for the condition, another rise in the statewide tally of known cases and hints at the much wider impact.
Nearly one third of Minnesota’s 87 counties have now been affected.
Minnesota’s first victim was a Ramsey County resident who was between 80 and 89 years old and related to someone exposed to COVID-19 through international travel. The individual was high-risk in terms of age but also had underlying health problems, making the case an illustration of the serious threat the outbreak poses to vulnerable Minnesotans, state Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said during a news conference.
Total confirmed cases in Minnesota grew to 137 Saturday, but health officials said the actual tally could already exceed 10,000 cases.
“Don’t think, ‘Oh, there are 137 cases in the state,’ ” said Kris Ehresmann, the state Health Department’s infectious disease director. “You can think that. … That’s just the tip of the iceberg.”
Minnesota is the latest of many states to report a death from COVID-19. The U.S. has reported 19,624 cases and 260 deaths, the health department says, while the worldwide counts have grown to 284,000 cases and 11,800 deaths since the outbreak started in December.
The state reported its first COVID-19 patient about two weeks ago. Since then, 12 patients have been hospitalized, including six who were still in the hospital on Saturday. Four of the patients were in intensive care units.
“We do see a shift toward more severe disease in our hospitals,” Malcolm said. “The rest of the patients, those who were hospitalized and the great majority of the reported cases in total, have been recovering and are recovering at home.”
The Ramsey County resident who died first showed symptoms on March 13, Ehresmann said, and was hospitalized three days later. The person died March 19. In about 80% of cases, COVID-19 patients experience mild symptoms.
Case count to rise
Public health officials Saturday stressed the confirmed case count surely understates the extent of infection across Minnesota, particularly with the state’s limited supply of testing capabilities.
Asked about a New York Times/Columbia University report suggesting infection rates are at least 11 times that of diagnosed cases, Ehresmann said: “I think that’s probably a conservative estimate.” She emphasized that residents of Minnesota counties with no diagnosed cases should not assume they won’t be exposed.
“Obviously tenfold [more cases] sounds like, ‘Wow, that’s a lot,’ ” Ehresmann said. “But it could be as high as a hundredfold. I think the bottom line is there’s a lot of COVID-19 circulating in Minnesota and that’s why it’s so important that people take the community mitigation seriously.”
Over the past week, the state has temporarily closed restaurants, bars and schools while promoting “social distancing” to cut virus transmission. Residents have been asked to stay home as much as possible, maintain a distance of 6 feet from other people, replace in-person work meetings with teleworking, and cancel gatherings of 50 people or more.
Hospitals and health care workers, meanwhile, have sounded alarms that the supply of masks and other protective gear for workers might not be sufficient as the number of infected patients grows.
Malcolm said the Walz administration is thankful that private companies and other institutions have started to come forward to try to address those needs and is working to identify more possible resources.
On Friday, Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity donated to M Health Fairview some 7,500 masks used in intensive care that filter out 95% of airborne particles. Fairview says it uses about 1,000 of these “N95 masks” per day across its health system, which includes 10 hospitals, including the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis.
Homemade masks
In Alexandria, a doctor is following the example of an Indiana hospital by organizing quilters and sewers to make masks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says homemade masks can be used “as a last resort.”
Fairview is not now accepting homemade masks from the public but said in a statement that it’s developing instructions on how to do so “should we need them.” Allina Health on Saturday started asking for donations of factory-made N95 and ear loop masks, as well as hand-sewn ear loop masks.
Instructions on how to make hand-sewn masks can be viewed at allinahealth.org/coronavirus.
The new coronavirus was first detected in Minnesota with cases imported by travelers, but the Health Department reported six days ago the first evidence of community transmission. That means the virus passed to people who hadn’t traveled outside the state or knowingly been exposed to someone else with a confirmed case.
Ehresmann said Saturday that the state is seeing “a general shift toward more and more community transmission.”
The statewide count of confirmed cases jumped from 115 to 137 Saturday. The number of counties with confirmed cases grew from 21 to 26.
Health officials also reported a confirmed case in a 10-year-old, the youngest state resident caught up in the outbreak thus far. The child is home-schooled, Ehresmann said.
In recent days, speculation has grown that Gov. Tim Walz might follow the example of other states in issuing a “shelter in place” order that would confine people to their homes except for essential business. On Saturday, Ehresmann said Minnesota wasn’t yet at that point.
But, she added, “We don’t anticipate the number of cases slowing at all.”"
"March 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/biden-campaign-seeks-to-adapt-amid-coronavirus/569038652/,StarTribune,Biden campaign seeks to adapt amid coronavirus,"WASHINGTON – Joe Biden's campaign rushed to build a television studio in his home to better communicate to the American people how he believes a president should deal with the coronavirus epidemic. But when he made his first live appearance there Monday, none of the major cable channels took it live.
It illustrated the challenges the Democratic presidential front-runner faces during a crisis that has changed American life. While he's beginning to prepare for the general election campaign against President Donald Trump, Biden still hasn't secured the Democratic nomination.
And unlike senators debating legislation or governors working to protect their constituents, the former vice president is now a private citizen. There's no action he can directly take or information that is only his to deliver.
Meanwhile, Trump has dominated television and computer screens with his daily coronavirus briefings.
Democrats sought someone to take the lead in answering what they saw as the president's erroneous statements, while pushing for greater urgency in the federal response. But instead of Biden, it was New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who emerged to lead the response by holding his own daily briefings from Albany — including one on Monday that aired live on cable TV while Biden spoke via livestream. The governor's interventions were widely praised, including by Biden, who called them ""a lesson in leadership.""
In the livestream on Monday, which the campaign said was watched by 230,000 people, Biden criticized the Trump administration's response to containing the outbreak while being careful not to seem too overtly political. ""Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus. But he does bear responsibility for our response,"" Biden said.
The statement was just the first of what he has assured supporters will be a regular flow of interviews, videos and discussions. His team is considering mounting virtual rope lines, where voters would get to briefly interact with Biden by video chat, as well as longer video conversations between the candidate and his supporters. It's also exploring podcasts and other long-form media. ""We are absolutely looking into and experimenting with any way of replicating a traditional campaign experience virtually and capitalizing on his biggest strength, which is connecting with voters,"" spokesman TJ Ducklo said.
Biden will test out his new setup again on Tuesday on ABC's ""The View."""
"March 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/it-s-time-for-sanders-to-bow-out-gracefully/569041502/,StarTribune,It's time for Sanders to bow out gracefully,"Two years before the 2016 election, pundits sneered when U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said he might run for president because he thought the Democratic Party had lost touch with millions of disaffected Americans.
Fast-forward to February 2016, and Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment by almost beating front-runner Hillary Clinton in Iowa and trouncing her in New Hampshire.
Yes, Sanders eventually lost to Clinton. But he gained a place in history books by showing that millions of voters, especially younger ones, were fed up with what they saw as the caution of Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Yes, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York also fueled the rise of Democratic progressives. But Sanders did the most to reveal many Americans’ appetite for a more generous government — one that offered free college and health care, wiped out student loan debt and required the wealthy to pay far more in taxes.
The 2020 campaign has not gone so well for him. He narrowly lost in Iowa and won in New Hampshire — again — but since the Feb. 29 primary in South Carolina, he has fallen farther and farther behind former Vice President Joe Biden, whose sweep last week in Florida, Illinois and Arizona all but clinched the Democratic nomination. A Sanders aide said he would “assess” his options.
It shouldn’t be a long assessment. Sanders can burnish his name in history by gracefully conceding the nomination and doing as much as he can to ensure his deeply loyal supporters vote for Biden in November. In 2016, an estimated 12% of Sanders supporters — many believing the Democratic Party acted to get Hillary Clinton nominated — voted for Republican Donald Trump. Some didn’t vote at all.
That can’t happen again because as disturbing as Trump’s presidency has been, the last two months may go down as disastrous. While he has accepted the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic and sought to safeguard Americans by shutting the nation down, each day brings fresh evidence of what his delay has cost.
On Feb. 24, he tweeted the coronavirus was “very much under control in the USA.” Last week, many Americans were sheltering in place in their homes while Ohio postponed its primary to protect the public and voters in other states clustered closer together than science says is safe.
Now Trump is trying to rewrite history with a jaw-dropping claim that the pandemic was “something that nobody expected.” The truth is Trump’s missteps — starting with his administration’s slowness in launching mass testing — will lead to unnecessary American deaths. Sanders and his supporters hoped he’d prevail, but fate has something else in store. If he helps Biden win over his followers and defeat Trump, Sanders will have changed history for the better."

The decision announced by the Minnesota Department of Revenue Monday follows that of the federal government, which has pushed back Tax Day from April 15 to July 15.
The extensions are in line with broader efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus, which has forced the closing of many businesses and forced workers to stay home. The Walz administration said the extra time is part of the state’s continued peacetime emergency response to COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
The Minnesota Department of Revenue said the extension means tax filers have until July 15 to file and make their payments without any penalties or interest."
"March 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-pandemic-in-the-u-s-far-more-people-have-covid-19-than-you-think/569041612/,StarTribune,The pandemic in the U.S.: Far more people have COVID-19 than you think,"As an infectious-disease epidemiologist who’s worked on pandemics for two decades, I’ve talked in recent days to journalists and health officials around the U.S. and from halfway around the world about how to stop the coronavirus. They all have the same questions: How many tests do we need? How should we use tests? For each case we know about, how many more cases are out there? What’s the best way to find undiagnosed cases? Should we do “active case finding,” which involves testing everyone who is mildly ill, then isolating known cases and quarantining and isolating their contacts? Instead — or in addition — should we implement intense social distancing, close schools and take other similar measures?
Everyone asks the same important, interrelated questions. In one respect, the answer is the same for all of them: We must vastly expand our testing capacity. No country has controlled transmission effectively without massive testing capacity. The U.S. currently has a sliver of the capacity we need, which is only a tiny fraction of that available in other countries. South Korea has performed over 320,000 tests — almost one for every 150 people. That is 30 times the testing per capita that we have done in the United States. Exceptional teams are racing to solve testing bottlenecks at local and state levels, filling the vacuum left by the complete absence of federal leadership. Regulatory and technical hurdles accounted for early delays. Now that we’re past those, several shortages are getting in the way. We don’t have enough protective equipment for testers, nor swabs for sampling or reagents to extract genetic material from the virus. We don’t have enough physical test kits, or enough human power to run large-scale testing. The result is that we have no idea how many people are infected with the coronavirus, or how fast the virus is spreading.
For most of the other questions about strategy, the best answer depends on local conditions. Different parts of the world, and maybe even different parts of the country, are in very different situations. The best strategy depends critically on which stage of the outbreak you are in and how much testing is available. This is a subject infectious-disease epidemiologists have been thinking about for years. My colleagues and I have been adapting our earlier peer-reviewed work to the present pandemic. One size does not fit all.
A few places — many of them islands, like Singapore and Taiwan — have so far kept the epidemic relatively under control. They found and tested most of the initial imported cases; they deployed a skilled public health workforce to isolate people with the virus and trace and quarantine their contacts; and they’ve managed to maintain a “containment” strategy to good effect. The same can be said of Hong Kong and New Zealand. Iceland has combined containment with massive testing of its population. So far, this strategy has worked, and in these places, it would be wise to keep to it unless evidence that it is failing starts to emerge.
Containment can work when there are few enough cases that the public health system is able to deal with them and their contacts, so that the workload is manageable, and when a large fraction of cases are tested and identified, so that preventing them from infecting anyone else dramatically reduces the total amount of transmission.
For jurisdictions like these, case-based interventions (isolation, contact tracing and quarantine) can be the centerpiece of the control strategy — because they are highly effective. It may be necessary to supplement these with broad social distancing measures, of the sort we have been emphasizing recently in the U.S., to snuff out any unobserved chains of transmission that might get past public health authorities. Places like Singapore can afford to keep schools open — and more generally to impose less stringent social distancing measures — precisely because the case-based interventions are working.
But the situation in the U.S. right now is very different.
The feckless federal response created such delays in testing that most cases here are not being confirmed, even now. We don’t know even approximately how many people are infected, but it’s certainly more than the recent count of more than 33,000 confirmed cases. Even though many places are reporting relatively small numbers of confirmed cases, this is not comforting. In many parts of the country, we are seeing rising numbers of flu-like illnesses that when tested, are not flu, and may well actually be COVID-19 if only we could test them. Observations like this convince epidemiologists that the large majority of cases are undetected. Given the various shortages, testing capacity in the short term is limited. But at this point, it’s not going to be possible to find and test all the cases that actually exist, even if we massively ramped up testing. Despite welcome improvements in testing across the country, finding and testing all the contacts of confirmed cases when the numbers are increasing this quickly wouldn’t be feasible at the best of times — let alone now.
To be clear, any person known to have COVID-19 should, of course, be isolated to avoid onward transmission. But this strategy alone — and the tracing and quarantine of contacts that is central to Singapore or Taiwan’s strategy — is inadequate to the problem we are already facing in the United States. It’s just a matter of numbers. If we only know about 1 in 10 cases, then even perfectly effective interventions on known cases can block only 10% of transmission. More likely in the U.S., we know about an even lower proportion.
For this reason, states and localities around the country have applied social distancing, a set of policies that can be effective without knowing who is infected or infectious. Implementation around the country has been widely variable, with shelter-in-place orders in multiple sites and minimal interventions to date in others. Intense social distancing must be the centerpiece of our strategy for now. There are reasonable concerns about how long this can continue, but these are no excuse for avoiding urgent action now to prevent an already bad situation from becoming worse.
For motivation to stay home, look at Italy, which reported 793 deaths on Saturday alone, and another 651 on Sunday, for a total of 5,476, and nearly 60,000 confirmed cases. Scant weeks ago, the country had identified only a handful of cases. New York and Washington state are scaling up testing and know they are not far behind; more worrisome still is a state like West Virginia that has done fewer than 400 tests and already found 12 cases. Such places have truly no way of knowing what they are facing.
So how should we use testing? Unlike in Singapore, at this stage in the U.S., there is little benefit in testing most asymptomatic or mildly ill individuals. The test results would not affect their treatment, because we still don’t have any treatment for COVID-19. Isolating these people will not do much to control the epidemic. But individuals who have been exposed to a known case and individuals with a mild respiratory illness should stay home and avoid social contacts, even more than the rest of us are doing.
If we can scale up testing and reduce case numbers through effective social distancing, we should consider testing very widely and resuming isolation and tracing, which work best in synergy with social distancing. For now, testing priority should go to hospitalized patients and health care workers (to protect them from infecting one another) and to surveillance to estimate the prevalence of mild infection in the community.
China and South Korea demonstrate that intensive testing and contact tracing, combined with intense (in China’s case) or moderate (South Korea) levels of social distancing can control the epidemic, even if it’s only temporarily. Among a number of other overdue actions, the White House should coordinate a national effort to achieve a testing capacity like that available in those countries and to get case numbers down to levels where we can plausibly track them individually. Until we get there, public health officials have the unenviable task of explaining why the tests we do have must be reserved for the purposes that contribute most to controlling the epidemic and treating the sickest patients."

With the move announced Monday, the nation's fifth-largest bank joins a growing number of firms to lift the pay of workers who are keeping key parts of the economy going as the spread of coronavirus forced many other businesses to temporarily close.
Also Monday, Hormel announced bonuses to workers at its production plants in Minnesota and elsewhere. Full-time workers received $300 and part-timers $150. The Austin, Minn.-based firm also extended sick leave and waived requirements for certain health benefits.
Banks, grocery stores, gas stations and a relative handful of other consumer businesses have stayed open while most closed as the nation tries to slow coronavirus.
""Words cannot begin to express the gratitude I have for our colleagues and all they have been doing to support our customers,"" Andy Cecere, chief executive of U.S. Bancorp, the Minneapolis-based parent company, said in a statement.
U.S. Bank may extend the pay bonus depending on how the fight against the disease plays out in coming weeks. For now, the step will cost U.S. Bank about $30 million.
The company said it also will give $30 million in donations to charities and other organizations that are helping people cope with the illness and economic fallout from it. U.S. Bank plans to give $4 million to national organizations that are helping small businesses and $26 million to local nonprofit organizations engaged in relief efforts.
U.S. Bank also said it will allow thousands of employees working in corporate and back-office operations who are not as busy at the present time to work instead with nonprofits while still collecting regular pay.
It called that effort a ""virtual volunteer network"" and said it will reach out to nonprofit organizations that may need help with financial education, online mentoring, marketing and project management.
Last Friday, Target Corp. said it would temporarily lift wages for 300,000 workers at its 1,800 stores across the country. Several grocery stores around the Twin Cities have also increased pay temporarily as they try to reward and retain employees at a critical time, and attract people to apply for job openings."
"March 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/gov-walz-announces-halt-to-eviction-proceedings-amid-coronavirus/569034822/,StarTribune,Gov. Walz announces halt to eviction proceedings amid coronavirus,"Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday a ban on new eviction proceedings to prevent Minnesota landlords from removing people from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic.
The governor said in a news conference call from self-imposed quarantine that landlords and financial institutions cannot start eviction proceedings during the state’s peacetime emergency for the virus. Walz said halting evictions was necessary to slow the spread of the coronavirus and it would be “not only personally cruel, but counterproductive to what we’re trying to do” if people did not have a home to stay in.
“We’re asking people to stay at home as much as possible. Having a stable home is going to be critical,” Walz said. “Certainly we’re asking people who are blessed enough or in a position enough to be able to make their rent and mortgage payment to continue to do so, obviously.”
The executive order would only allow evictions in cases where a tenant seriously endangers the safety of other residents or violates other laws like bringing in controlled substances or using or possessing firearms unlawfully. The order also stops the execution of writs of recovery where sheriff’s deputies order tenants to move out of their apartments or be forcibly removed.
The order says “nothing in this Executive Order relieves a tenant’s obligation to pay rent.”
Banks are urged to avoid foreclosures and related evictions and late fees for mortgage payments are discouraged if there was a decrease in income or substantial medical expenses caused by the coronavirus, according to the order.
More than 24 other states, counties, cities and judicial districts nationwide have issued directives suspending evictions, according to the executive order. President Donald Trump also announced last week that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will suspend all foreclosures and evictions until April 30.
Walz’s order will override the Minnesota court system’s previous suspension of some housing court proceedings as part of their change in operations due to the virus. Tenant rights advocates have pushed the courts and local sheriff’s departments to stop evictions amid the pandemic. They’ve pointed to the risk that large, crowded courtrooms and hallways may cause more infections and that removing people from their homes when they need to be indoors puts them at risk.
Advocates have also pointed out that the pandemic has upended the state’s workforce, with workers being laid off, losing wages or waiting for unemployment benefits, while closed schools and businesses have scrambled family routines and household budgets.
Walz’s announcement is “exactly what we were hoping for” said Luke Grundman, managing attorney of the housing unit for Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, a nonprofit legal advocacy group. “The governor was willing to do things that the courts weren’t willing to do or didn’t feel they had power to do.”
The Minnesota Multi-Housing Association, the state organization for property owners, released unprecedented guidelines encouraging members who own and operate rental apartments to offer flexibility to tenants affected by the pandemic, including waiving late fees for those unable to pay their rent on time and repayment plans for missed rent. The recommendations also suggest members halt evictions of renters. The guidelines are in place until May 31.
Cecil Smith, president and CEO of the Minnesota Multi-Housing Association and a rental property owner and manager in Minneapolis, said they’re encouraging renters to proactively communicate with their property managers as much as possible.
“We’re very concerned for the health and well-being of residents and for the financial sustainability of our properties,” he said.
Smith said building owners he’s been in touch with don’t consider waiving rents an option, and that the recommendations are aimed at maintaining housing stability for both residents and building owners who have mortgages, utilities, property taxes and other expenses that must be paid."

Is there a point at which flattening the curve of viral infection causes more damage than it prevents, and where is that point? What cost to the U.S. and global economies are Americans willing to accept to save the lives of those most vulnerable to the pandemic?
Even if the government were to encourage everyone back to normal life sooner than public health officials and epidemiologists advise, will people feel safe enough to do so?
“WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” President Donald Trump tweeted late Sunday night, triggering a debate Monday that fell along partisan lines.
Governors, including Minnesota’s Tim Walz, have imposed social distancing rules that have shut down public life in hopes of slowing the spread of the virus and preventing the health care system from being overwhelmed. But information about the virus is imperfect.
As of Monday, there were 374,921 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. So far 16,411 people had died from the virus, a 4.4% death rate. But likely hundreds of thousands have contracted the virus without being tested or suffering symptoms of COVID-19, so the real mortality rate is unclear.
Meanwhile, financial markets fell another 3.5% Monday, and are down more than a third since a month ago. Wall Street banks are projecting the U.S. economy will contract dramatically in the April-June quarter.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Bloomberg that unemployment could soar to 30%, which would be worse than 1933, the worst year of the Great Depression.
In Minnesota, 123,624 people have applied for unemployment benefits since last Monday, a number that represents more than 4% of the workforce and likely undercounts the jump in joblessness over the past week.
Some trade-offs between health and the larger economy have already been made in the U.S.
Grocery workers are risking their health to work checkout lines so people can buy food. Child care providers are staying open, despite the risk to employees and the potential spread of the virus through classrooms of children, to give parents the chance to continue working.
The implications of a U.S. economic crash go well beyond the U.S. and are “not a small thing,” said Sridhar Venkatapuram, a professor of global health and philosophy at King’s College in London. He and others, such as Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, point out that extended joblessness has a serious human cost.
In the United Kingdom, leaders calculated that shutting down society was not worth the economic cost, and pursued what Venkatapuram called a “brutal utilitarian ethical calculation” that would have allowed the virus to quickly work its way through the country and kill the approximately 1% of those infected who were likely to die from it.
“There was a really severe backlash because that 1% is actually 200,000 people,” Venkatapuram said. “Then they started backtracking.”
In the U.S., the response to the virus has been patchwork — it varies by state, and the message from the White House has swung from downplaying the severity of the virus early on to encouraging broad social distancing measures to emphasizing the need to get the economy back up and running.
At this point, Venkatapuram said, many people would not return to normal routines even if encouraged to do so.
Ultimately, the policy decisions fall not to epidemiologists or economists, Venkatapuram said, but to governors, prime ministers and presidents whose job is to look across disciplines and make hard choices.
“One of the most difficult things that a leader can do, even in the best of circumstances, is make decisions about lives. Which lives will survive, and which lives won’t, is the most stark trade-off you will make,” Venkatapuram said. “It’s not something that you can do over time. It’s now. Choose now.”"
"March 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/coronavirus-will-cost-minneapolis-millions-in-lost-revenue/569077532/,StarTribune,Coronavirus will cost Minneapolis millions in lost revenue,"The city of Minneapolis could lose $45 million to $125 million in revenue from the business closures and other measures taken to fight the spread of the coronavirus, according to preliminary estimates.
That loss — which represents up to 7% of the city’s budgeted revenue — adds to the pressure on city officials, who must decide how to allocate money at a time when many residents are asking for extra help to cope with the financial fallout of the pandemic.
Council Member Steve Fletcher noted he was proud that Minneapolis is taking precautions and that people are “acting in the interest of public health.” But he also hopes the city will continue to take a close look at its finances.
“We need to proceed in a clearheaded way, knowing the costs, understanding that we are incurring real costs to look out for each other,” he said.
He added later: “When we look at adjusting our own city budget, we are talking about people, and it’s critically important that we keep our focus on that.”
The city’s budget office began working two weeks ago to predict the financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, and budget director Micah Intermill presented the early figures to a council committee Tuesday afternoon.
The city anticipates the largest decreases in local taxes that it would typically collect when large events, such as conventions or sports competitions, are held in the city. It anticipates hits to its interest on earnings, as well as to parking fees and utility charges, as more people who live outside Minneapolis stay at home rather than coming to work in the city.
The city has waived some license fees for businesses but anticipates it will receive those later in the year. There could be a decline in licensing revenue if some businesses close permanently, Intermill said.
Intermill noted that “much uncertainty exists now,” and the numbers could easily change, depending on the length and severity of the coronavirus outbreak. It could also depend on how long the city and state continue their emergency orders that limit the operations of bars, restaurants and other businesses.
“I’m in no way advocating one way or another as to which way we go on social distancing,” Intermill told council members. “I’m just explaining that has an impact on revenue.”
The city is also closely monitoring its coronavirus spending in hopes that it might eventually be able to get some expenses reimbursed by the state or federal governments.
An emergency declaration signed by Mayor Jacob Frey on March 16 allows the city to bypass its normal contracting procedures to get items needed to respond to the coronavirus.
Since Frey signed the order, the city has spent roughly $500,000 for emergency supplies, mostly for protective equipment for first responders, but also for cleaning supplies and additional equipment to help city employees work remotely, according to Lori Johnson, the city’s deputy CFO.
Intermill said the city has reshuffled some money to help with coronavirus expenses so far.
Intermill said Frey has notified city department heads that they shouldn’t expect budget increases next year but instead should expect something similar to the 2020 budget.
Council Member Lisa Goodman, who was in office during the last recession, cautioned her colleagues that she doesn’t think it will be that simple.
“I’ve been through this once before, and we’re not going to be talking about current service levels,” she said. “We’re going to be talking about major reductions in service.”
She urged the city to begin conserving cash and retooling existing city programs, noting that she worried about the financial hit to businesses and housing instability.
“We need to be working together, and thoughtful about how to hold up those who are most in pain right now while remembering that we might have to make choices ... putting other people in our city family at risk by laying off staff people,” she said."
"March 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/coronavirus-crisis-is-sure-to-spawn-new-political-realities-in-all-corners/569072512/,StarTribune,Coronavirus crisis is sure to spawn new political realities in all corners,"The social and political response to major catastrophes often proceeds in stages. Stage 1 is denial. Thankfully, this stage is largely over for the coronavirus crisis. Not counting a few poltroons and conspiracy theorists, nobody is saying it’s all hype or no big deal.
Now we’re transitioning, in fits and starts, from Stage 2 to Stage 3.
Politicians and policymakers are taking the threat seriously, but lacking contingency plans and the mental bandwidth to deal with all of the challenges that are arising, they’ve been falling back on what they already believe to be true. Stage 2 is the “COVID-19 confirms my priors” period.
For many Democrats, the roaring economy of eight weeks ago was the perfect time to push for canceling student debt, establishing a $15-per-hour minimum wage, implementing “Medicare for All,” etc. A runaway pandemic and the start of a massive shutdown of the economy only made it more obvious that these “priors” were absolutely necessary.
For many Republicans, the booming economy was the perfect time to push for tax cuts, immigration restrictions (including a border wall), a new cold war orientation toward China and a declaration of war on the media for being mean to the president. And lo and behold, as the coronavirus crisis shaped up, they too believed their ideas were all the more justified.
Just because these policies are priors doesn’t mean they are necessarily ill-suited to the moment. For instance, canceling some student debt makes more sense now than before, and a major rethinking of our economic entanglement with China seems acutely overdue. But this has more to do with serendipity than critical thinking.
Sometimes we get stuck in Stage 2. Shortly after 9/11, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., bowed to Democratic form when he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post arguing that the “era of a shrinking federal government is over.” (He called, familiarly, for a “new New Deal.”) George W. Bush, who ran for president arguing for a “humble” foreign policy, reverted to the conservative foreign policy establishment’s preference for regime change and nation-building, at least in part because it was the only fleshed-out program available. Both priors prevailed, not to our particular benefit.
This isn’t to say that both sides don’t try their best to deal with emergencies. But just as the stockpile of masks and ventilators is not adequate for the sudden demand, the same holds for the storehouse of policies we could put into effect right now. Or, to be more fair to the wonks who warned about some of these problems, there’s a lag time in getting new and better policies into production.
What Stage 3 of the coronavirus crisis will look like remains murky. Andrew Yang’s quest for universal cash payments to Americans seemed quixotic just weeks ago. Now it looks like the bedrock of a new policy agenda. The traditional Republican resistance to interference in corporate decisionmaking is being worn away by the hour, and once swept aside it seems unlikely to return in nearly as robust form. A new consensus may be quickly forming that government should have a much bigger say in how supply chains are structured, regardless of the corporate bottom line. It’s almost certain that the U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s dependence on China for basic medicinal ingredients will not survive this pandemic.
Other responses are still in the early stages, and big questions will need to be addressed, from how we should deploy the Defense Production Act to how to reconcile our federalist structure with public health crises.
Perhaps oddly, I find myself wondering — and worrying — about Stage 4. How will things look when this is all over? What will be the new normal? Will the handshake ever return? What emergency measures now will be our everyday reality years from now?
Tax withholding was invented to collect revenue during World War II. The imperial presidency, with its vast retinue of executive branch officials answerable directly to the presidency, was created to give Franklin D. Roosevelt more power to fight the Great Depression.
This pandemic will no doubt have a similarly long tail. The foundation of the property laws of Anglosphere nations was a response to the crisis of the Plague. (Historian Norman Cantor writes: “A barrister of 1350 deep frozen and thawed out today would need only a six-month refresher course at a first-rate American law school to practice property or real estate law today.”)
One of my priors is the idea that our political parties are overdue for a major transformation. The coalitions that constitute them are unstable and combustible. The ideas that once bound them together are frayed. This crisis will put even more strain on these already feeble institutions, as politicians are dragged out of their comfort zones. It’s too soon to tell if this assessment will be confirmed, but I’d take bets that after this is all over, political scientists, like so many others, will be writing about B.C. and A.C. — before coronavirus and after."
"March 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/gov-tim-walz-in-self-quarantine-after-contact-with-someone-who-has-covid-19/569026922/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz in self-quarantine as COVID-19 hits close to state leaders,"In the course of a few hours Monday, COVID-19 hit home in Minnesota.
Gov. Tim Walz, having come in contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus, appeared to be the first governor in the nation to self-quarantine due to exposure. About the same time, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced that her husband has been hospitalized after contracting the virus.
Meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan was mourning her big brother, who died from COVID-19.
For all three, it was a moment to remind Minnesotans to follow the emerging guidelines for navigating the pandemic.
Walz announced that he will not be leaving his home for the next two weeks after discovering that a member of his security detail tested positive for the coronavirus. He will continue to guide the state’s response to the outbreak from his St. Paul home.
Walz predicted the virus will infect 40% to 80% of Minnesotans, though the majority will recover without hospitalization. He warned that everyone in the state will be feeling the type of effects he and some fellow politicians are experiencing.
“Before we’re done with this each and every one of us will be touched by this,” Walz said during a telephone news conference Monday.
Walz said he is healthy and not showing any symptoms, but wanted to model the right protocol to stop the spread of COVID-19 by staying home with his family.
Walz continued his work by rolling out the latest in a series of executive orders to handle the outbreak. He ordered landlords to pause evictions during the pandemic, established a small business emergency loan program and called on non-hospital entities to donate personal protective equipment to health care providers.
In Klobuchar’s case, quarantine restrictions have prevented her from visiting her husband, John Bessler, in the hospital. Bessler, 52, works as a law professor in Baltimore and quarantined himself and stopped going to work after coming down with cold symptoms, Klobuchar said in a statement.
After developing a fever and coughing up blood, he sought medical care and was hospitalized in Virginia due to testing that showed “very low oxygen levels.” Bessler has developed pneumonia and is on oxygen, but does not need a ventilator at this time. He received confirmation that he has coronavirus on Monday morning, five days after taking the test.
“While I cannot see him and he is of course cut off from all visitors, our daughter, Abigail, and I are constantly calling and texting and e-mailing,” Klobuchar’s statement said. “We love him very much and pray for his recovery. He is exhausted and sick but a very strong and resilient person.”
Klobuchar struck a similar tone as Walz during a teleconference call Monday, warning, “This is going to happen to everyone.” She called for immediate action to help prepare hospitals.
Several members of the U.S. Senate are self-quarantining following interactions with U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who tested positive for the virus over the weekend. Among them are Utah Sens. Mike Lee and Mitt Romney. Klobuchar said because she and her husband have not been in the same place for two weeks, her doctors say she is outside the 14-day window for developing systems and does not need a test at this time.
“As everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don’t qualify to get one under any standard,” she said.
Klobuchar said she will continue her work in Washington, where lawmakers are negotiating details of a roughly $2 trillion economic stimulus package.
Meanwhile the lieutenant governor’s brother, Ron, died after getting the coronavirus in Tennessee. He had been diagnosed with cancer several weeks ago and his immune system was compromised, she wrote in an Instagram post Sunday.
“To many, he’ll be a statistic: Tennessee’s second COVID-related death. But to me, I’ll remember a loving, older brother, uncle, father, and husband,” Flanagan said.
She described her brother as a “tough-as-nails” Marine who was a big teddy bear on in the inside. Their politics did not match at all, the Democratic lieutenant governor said, and that was a source of constant jokes. Flanagan’s brother’s death follows that of her father, about two months ago.
She urged people to stay home to protect people like her brother.
“If you feel fine, that’s great. But please consider the possibility that you’re carrying the virus and don’t know it, and then you walk past the next Ron, my big brother, in public,” Flanagan wrote. “COVID-19 now has a personal connection to me. Please do all you can to prevent one for you.”
Walz, now telecommuting like thousands of other Minnesotans, underscored that message on social media. The governor tweeted a video of himself greeting Minnesotans from his residence, which he said was set up several weeks ago with the capacity to do video teleconferencing and other work.
Walz found out early Monday morning that a member of his security team had the coronavirus, and Walz hasn’t left the governor’s residence since then. The security staff member discovered he has the virus Sunday night and the governor was in proximity to that person late last week.
Walz will be working from the residence through April 6. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise anyone who comes in contact with someone who has the coronavirus to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
If he fell ill and was unable to guide the state, the responsibility would fall to Flanagan."
"March 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/u-s-must-come-to-the-rescue-of-health-providers/569072482/,StarTribune,U.S. must come to the rescue of health providers,"There is no question that health providers are the front-line heroes of the coronavirus pandemic. The integrity, selflessness and sheer bravery needed to deliver care in the midst of a highly infectious disease with no proven treatment or cure is awe-inspiring.
So why then are we allowing them to further jeopardize themselves by shorting them on the equipment they so desperately need? In the richest nation in the world, why are we asking people to break out sewing machines to make masks that may or may not suffice? Why are we forcing doctors to split ventilators, reuse masks and jeopardize their safety?
There is a way to alleviate these shortages. President Donald Trump must make full use of the Defense Production Act, and without delay. The announcement Tuesday that the government finally will use the act to procure more test kits is long overdue and falls short.
Passed in 1950, the act gives the federal government sweeping powers to compel industries to manufacture what is needed, for fair market compensation. It is not — as some federal officials, including Trump, have claimed — “nationalizing,” and it is wrong of them to so irresponsibly mislead the public.
Americans should applaud the companies in Minnesota and elsewhere that already have stepped up. 3M is manufacturing N95 masks at top capacity. Mayo Clinic already has produced an accurate coronavirus test and eliminated the state’s 1,700 backlog of test samples that had been frozen for lack of federal tests kids. There are others, all contributing.
But there is a greater need than what any handful of private companies can manage on their own. They cannot clear and prioritize their supply lines in the way the federal government can under the act. They cannot assume responsibility for coordinating 50-state distribution of those needed supplies.
States should not be in a bidding war with one another or the federal government. Among its other provisions, the act provides for the federal government to pay a fair market value for the products it requires. Then it can distribute such aid to states as needed.
Vice President Mike Pence said recently that New York state would get up to 4,000 ventilators from the national strategic reserve. But it needs 30,000. In Washington state some doctors and nurses were washing out masks between patients to preserve precious supplies, an unhygienic situation that jeopardized them and their patients.
Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro recently said, “We are getting what we need without putting the heavy hand of government down.”
Obviously that approach has fallen far short. This country needs a robust, well-coordinated federal response that gets states and medical providers what they need now, not months from now. Companies must be assured that the federal government will use its power to clear the path for supply chains needed to speed the massive, rapid production of masks, respirators, ventilators, hand sanitizers, whatever providers need to deal with this pandemic.
There should be no need for the daily, emotional pleadings of American public officials and medical providers for the basic equipment needed to treat a global pandemic. America should be producing enough not only for its own needs, but also to aid Italy, Spain and other countries without such capability."
"March 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/st-paul-mayor-carter-announces-cash-grants-for-poor-families-small-businesses/569107972/,StarTribune,"St. Paul mayor announces cash grants for poor families, small businesses","The city of St. Paul will provide $2,000 grants to poor families and $7,500 to small businesses struggling during the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Melvin Carter announced Wednesday.
In a presentation to the City Council conducted by video conference, Carter outlined a plan for a $3.25 million ""bridge fund"" to get cash assistance to the city's neediest residents and small businesses within the coming weeks.
""We have no way of knowing how long this will last, nor predicting the full scope of impacts on our local community,"" Carter said. ""But one thing is obvious: We must take every action we can right now to mitigate its harmful effects.""
Families who have experienced a loss of income because of COVID-19, have at least one child in St. Paul Public Schools and earn 40% or less of the area median income — $40,000 a year for a family of four — will be eligible for $2,000 to help pay their rent or mortgage.
Businesses that have 20 or fewer employees, gross revenue of $2 million or less and have been operating in St. Paul for the past six months will be eligible for $7,500 to cover costs including rent, payroll, employee health benefits and payments to suppliers.
The program, which council members are scheduled to vote on April 1, would be funded through the city's Housing and Redevelopment Authority budget and private philanthropy, including from the St. Paul and Minnesota Foundation and Ecolab Foundation.
Council members, speaking through headsets from their homes, expressed support for Carter's plan and noted the growing need among their constituents.
""Until we find the magical pause button that pauses everyone's mortgage and everything, there's going to have to be a conversation about straight cash supporting people,"" said Council Member Mitra Jalali. ""And that's politically difficult, but I think it's necessary, and so I appreciate us being willing to go there.""
Council Member Jane Prince raised concerns that, given the amount of money available, not enough people will get the help they need.
Carter acknowledged that the $3.25 million from the city, even combined with resources from the state and federal governments, ""still will likely be inadequate to meet the full need that we're seeing in our communities right now."" City officials are considering other ways to help residents, he said, including property tax relief and assistance for low-income artists.
Carter declared a state of local emergency on March 15, closing libraries and parks and recreation facilities and stopping the issuance of new permits involving gatherings of 50 or more people. In the time since, city employees who are able to work remotely have started doing so, and social distancing measures have been implemented for those who cannot.
City workers will get 80 hours of emergency pandemic leave to be used if they are sick or caring for a sick relative. The council will vote to approve an agreement between the city and unions that represent city workers next week.
The mayor and council members repeatedly emphasized Wednesday that quick action is needed to support city employees and residents as the pandemic evolves.
During Carter's presentation, Council President Amy Brendmoen said a small-business owner sent her a text message that said, ""I'm freaking out and I'm going to need some help to survive. What do you suggest?""
""I'm really grateful that we're going to be able to say, 'We can help you,' "" Brendmoen said."
"March 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/distilleries-hope-for-help-from-congress/569108432/,StarTribune,Distilleries hope for help from Congress,"Hundreds of liquor distillers say they have already begun — or are planning — to turn over a portion of their liquor production to addressing the nationwide shortage of another alcohol-intensive product — hand sanitizers.
“There’s well over 350-plus distillers around the country that have been mobilizing … pivoting to take their distilled spirits and make hand sanitizers,” said Chris Swonger, president and chief executive of the Distilled Spirits Council, a Washington-based association.
Now, distillers want an exemption on a tax that is typically levied on spirit production.
The Distilled Spirits Council has been lobbying to get an add to the $2 trillion coronavirus economic relief package being negotiated in Congress that would exempt any of the hand sanitizers made by distillers from the $13.50 per proof gallon federal excise tax on liquor products.
A proof gallon is a gallon of 100-proof liquor, which amounts to 50% alcohol in content. Distillers would actually have to beef up their alcohol content since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the ethanol content of hand sanitizers must be at least 60% alcohol to be effective against COVID-19.
Small distillers already pay just $2.70 per proof gallon because they receive an 80% cut in the federal excise tax thanks to the fiscal 2020 spending law. But that is just on the first 100,000 proof gallons they make. Above that they pay the full $13.50 per gallon.
Swonger said he has seen “broad bipartisan support” to add the waiver of the excise tax.
There are at least a few supporters for the exemption in Congress. “We have a lot of distillers in our state, and God bless them,” Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “They’re stepping up, and instead of distilling whiskey, they are moving to sanitizers. And, yes, to those distillers, we know there is an excise tax problem, and we are on it trying to resolve that for you.”
Another big supporter is Rep. John Yarmuth, chairman of the House Budget Committee. The Kentucky Democrat represents Louisville, which is home to two large distilleries that are already making hand sanitizer.
Supporters have faced an uphill climb. A draft version of the Senate bill circulated Tuesday and obtained by CQ Roll Call did not appear to contain the provision.
In recognition of the hand-sanitizer shortage, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance last week for the temporary manufacture of the product.
A number of big producers announced they would step into the breach. Paris-based Pernod Ricard said it has already begun producing hand sanitizer at four U.S. locations, including its Rabbit Hold Distillery in Louisville, Ky.
Pernod Ricard makes an array of whiskeys (Jameson Irish, Glenlivet, Chivas Regal), along with Absolut vodka, Beefeater gin, tequilas and wines.
Britain-based Diageo, maker of Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff, said Monday it would donate more than 2 million liters of 96% alcohol to manufacturers, enabling them to produce 8 million bottles of hand sanitizer.
And Bacardi said Monday that its facilities in Louisville, Jacksonville, Fla., and Puerto Rico, are already supplying emergency workers with free hand sanitizer and would produce 100,000 gallons additionally for U.S. distribution.
Bacardi said all of its sanitizers will have 70% to 80% ethanol content, which is above levels recommended by the World Health Organization, the distiller noted.
Many craft distillers are transitioning into making hand sanitizer, Swonger said, noting that a temporary exemption would save them not just the excise tax they currently pay, but would keep their hand sanitizer production from being counted against the 100,000 gallon limit.
Smaller distillers in particular rely on revenue from tours and tasting rooms, which have been shut down because of the virus, so the opportunity for temporary revenue from the manufacture of hand sanitizers is attractive to them, Swonger said."
"March 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/senators-sold-the-nation-short-with-stock-trading/569108332/,StarTribune,Senators sold the nation short with stock trading,"Two Republican U.S. senators, Richard Burr of North Carolina and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, are at the center of a political scandal.
Actually, make that two scandals.
The first, better-known one involves allegations that the senators sold stock near the peak of the market after they received a Jan. 24 private briefing about the potential severity of the coronavirus crisis.
(Stock sales by two other senators — Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma — have raised similar questions, but Feinstein said her stocks are in a blind trust, and Inhofe said he did not attend the briefing and was not involved in the trades. In addition, Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said his investment adviser bought stock in a German diagnostic company.)
Burr handled his own transaction and sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings, according to ProPublica, which broke the story. Loeffler began selling the day of the briefing, and overall sold between $1.275 million to $3.1 million of stock she jointly owned with her husband, who happens to be the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. While the vast majority of Loeffler’s portfolio activity represented sales, there were two purchases, including of Citrix, a tech firm that enables remote work.
Whether Burr and Loeffler did anything illegal requires more investigation. But such action “really destroys public confidence,” Richard W. Painter, a professor of corporate law at the University of Minnesota, told an editorial writer. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration and ran for Senate in 2018, said members of Congress should be required to have their investments in mutual funds, not individual stocks.
Both Burr and Loeffler have vigorously defended their actions. Loeffler claims that her stock sales were executed by an independent third party. And in a statement, Burr said that he “relied solely on public news reports” to guide his trading, specifically citing CNBC coverage from Asia. Still, Burr asked the chairman of Senate Ethics Committee “to open a complete review the matter with full transparency.”
Full transparency would be the last phrase to describe how Barr and Loeffler communicated about COVID-19, and therein lies the less publicized but perhaps more damning disgrace. Both Burr and Loeffler, as members of the Senate Health Committee, heard from experts who likely leveled with the senators about the potential of a pandemic. But both downplayed it.
On Feb. 7, Burr and fellow Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee wrote in a Fox News commentary that although Americans were “rightfully concerned” about COVID-19, “Thankfully, the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump Administration.”
Similarly, just weeks after rushing to unload her stock, Loeffler seemed to talk up the market when she tweeted: “The consumer is strong, the economy is strong, & jobs are growing, which puts us in the best economic position to tackle #COVID19 & keep Americans safe.”
Lawmakers campaign on serving “the people.” When they serve themselves instead, there have to be consequences, whether it comes from ethics investigations or voters."
"March 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/target-redoes-year-s-plan-as-sales-surge-20-mainly-because-of-coronavirus/569086582/,StarTribune,Target revises year's plan as sales surge 20% mainly because of coronavirus,"Target’s sales have spiked more than 20% this month from people stocking up on food and household supplies, yet the disruption caused by the coronavirus means the retailer is putting on hold or postponing its other plans for the year, Target CEO Brian Cornell said.
The Minneapolis-based company will scale back the number of remodels and new stores this year as well as pause plans to add fresh groceries and alcohol to its pickup services.
In doing so, Cornell said the company hopes to minimize potential disruptions while employees are hustling to restock shelves, sanitize checkout lanes and fulfill a record number of Drive Up and in-store pickup orders during this “unprecedented time.”
“We need to be disciplined about making sure our stores and supply chain can focus on serving our guests without any unnecessary distractions, knowing that we’ll need to prioritize the flow of food, medicine, and other essentials for the foreseeable future,” Cornell told reporters.
As Target has re-prioritized, Cornell also acknowledged that the time it is taking to get online orders to people’s homes has increased. But he said the company plans to get it back to a two-day window as things settle down.
At the same time, Target noted that its profit margins may take a hit as apparel sales fall as the coronavirus threat changes people’s buying habits and as the retailer spends more than expected on wage increases and benefits.
Target’s shares dropped 9.5% on Wednesday after the retailer announced these changes.
As the COVID-19 crisis has unfolded, many department stores, specialty retailers, restaurants and bars have shut down for at least two weeks. But retailers such as Target, Walmart, Costco and groceries that sell food, medicine and other essentials have remained open and have been seeing a deluge in shopping — and in some cases hoarding — that has led to frequently empty shelves of items like frozen chicken, disinfectant wipes and toilet paper.
“A surge in stock-up shopping really set in at the end of February, and in the weeks since then there’s been a prolonged surge,” Cornell said.
While Target’s comparable sales in February, up 3.8%, were fairly in line with expectations, he said sales and traffic greatly accelerated in March, with categories such as food, beverage and household supplies skyrocketing 50%. In addition, he said the company has seen strong sales in office supplies, crafting items, games and small kitchen appliances as more families work, eat and stay at home.
Meanwhile, Target’s overall apparel sales are down more than 20% this month, which could hurt the retailer’s gross profit margins since those tend to be more profitable.
On Wednesday, Target also announced stepped-up safety measures to what it had already rolled out in recent weeks as both employees and customers are on heightened alert about their risk of catching the virus. It will temporarily stop selling and packing items into reusable bags.
Target also will discontinue accepting returns for three weeks, while giving an extended return window once that suspension is lifted.
And it will now have workers clean checkout lanes after each transaction (instead of once every 30 minutes), mark where customers should stand 6 feet apart while waiting in line, and ensure customers are social distancing.
Given how rapidly the business is fluctuating and the continued uncertainty about the coronavirus, Target, like many retailers, withdrew on its quarterly and full-year guidance it laid out three weeks ago. It is also suspending share buybacks.
At its investors’ meeting in early March, Target’s leaders laid out a number of projects for the year, which are now being pared.
Target had planned to remodel 300 stores this year. On Wednesday, it said it would complete 130 of them which are already underway and will delay the others until next year since they can be disruptive to store teams.
Although it had planned to open 36 small-format stores this year, which would have been a company record, Target said it will reduce that to about 20 stores and move the remaining projects to next year.
“This preserves our focus on daily operations that are crucially important right now,” said Cornell.
This spring, the company had also planned to begin adding fresh grocery in the Twin Cities, and alcohol in other markets, to its in-store pickup and Drive Up services, with a wider rollout to more stores across the chain later in the year. But those initiatives are now on hold.
Target also said it expects to have higher costs than expected in the quarter as it has increased pay, hours and benefits. Last week, Target announced it would spend more than $300 million on temporary $2 an hour wage increases for hourly workers, bonuses and increased benefits and paid sick time for employees. Other retailers have announced similar measures.
While other retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, CVS and Dollar General are hiring tens of thousands of additional workers to keep up with demand, Cornell said Target is offering additional hours to current employees first to increase staffing of services such as order pickup and Drive Up and then will hire from the outside as needed."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/unitedhealth-group-pushes-self-collected-covid-19-test/569111292/,StarTribune,UnitedHealth Group pushes self-collected COVID-19 test,"A new COVID-19 test method would let patients swab their own noses for specimens at designated testing sites — an approach that could help with swab shortages and conserve dwindling supplies of protective gear for health care workers.
Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group announced study results Wednesday that support the new approach, which was developed by doctors at one of the company’s clinics near Seattle.
A testing expert at the Mayo Clinic, which was not involved with the study, called the Wednesday announcement “a significant step in our fight against COVID-19” because UnitedHealth Group says the results prompted the Food and Drug Administration to update guidance to health care providers.
“The FDA has moved forward with allowing COVID-19 samples to be collected from the lower nostrils using a simple swabbing procedure that can be self-administered by people experiencing coronavirus symptoms,” the Seattle-based Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said in a statement. “This will reduce the need for health care workers to use gowns, masks, and gloves to collect samples.”
UnitedHealth and the Gates Foundation collaborated on the research with the University of Washington and lab-testing giant Quest Diagnostics.
The study found that tests using self-administered swabs accurately detected COVID-19 in more than 90% of positive patients. That rate is “consistent with the clinician-administered test,” UnitedHealth Group said in a news release.
The study was conducted in nearly 500 patients at UnitedHealth’s network of clinics in Seattle, a city that for some time was “the epicenter of this epidemic” in the U.S., Dr. Deneen Vojta, the company’s chief medical officer for research and development, said in an online video posted Wednesday.
The idea for self-administered tests came from Dr. Yuan-Po Tu, an infectious disease physician at Everett Clinic, one of UnitedHealth’s large medical groups in Seattle. The novel coronavirus is so “hot,” Vojta said, that Tu speculated health care workers could easily direct patients to use shorter swabs to collect specimens from the front part of the nostril and mid-nose.
With most specimen collections right now, health care workers use very long swabs that go deep into the nose, Vojta said, and often cause patients to sneeze or even vomit.
“He called me and he said, ‘You know, Deneen, our front-line workers are going through the protective equipment 2 ½ gear per patient,’ ” Vojta said in the video. “What we found was, in fact, this [new method] worked just as well. ... This is still self-collection in a health care environment.”
A UnitedHealth Group spokesman said the FDA’s website describes the new approach as “acceptable” when the standard route for collecting specimens is not available. He said the company’s study prompted the change.
Dr. Dan Wattendorf of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation wrote in a blog post Wednesday: “We’re hopeful that it could be a game changer at a time when we will need to find ways to relieve stress on our health care system.”
Right now, health care providers are required to collect all samples and must first put on personal protective equipment in all cases. It takes a minute or two to get gowned up, Wattendorf said, but that step in a pandemic “may need to be repeated dozens of times a day.”
“The introduction of a simple swab could have a big impact on protecting health care providers and health care supplies over the next few weeks at a time when we expect a surge in cases,” Wattendorf wrote. “There is also an ample supply of these swabs at this time.”
Health care providers have reported shortages of the long swabs currently being used — one of many problems that has limited the supply of COVID-19 tests in the U.S.
Vojta of UnitedHealth Group stressed in the video that the company is not calling this an in-home test, since currently no such tests have been backed by federal regulators.
Matthew Binnicker, director of the clinical virology lab at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, said in a statement to the Star Tribune that study data are not yet available for public review, but the FDA’s updated guidance is an important change.
“Allowing patients to collect their own nasal swab, rather than requiring a provider-collected nasopharyngeal swab, will allow for broader COVID-19 testing, reduce exposures to health care workers, and conserve much needed personal protective equipment,” Binnicker said in a statement."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/masks-and-coronavirus-prevention-trying-to-find-some-clarity/569132592/,StarTribune,Masks and coronavirus prevention: Trying to find some clarity,"A procedural mask loosely covers the mouth and nose of the wearer and has straps that go over the ears. The term is often used interchangeably with “surgical mask,” but among U.S. medical suppliers a surgical mask is one with ties secured behind one’s head for a snugger, more secure fit. Both are usually made of three or four layers of nonwoven fabric, with one of the middle layers a melt-blown polymer that acts as a filter, and both are intended to be disposed of after use.
The surgical mask is meant for operating rooms and other sterile environments, procedural masks for areas that need to be clean but not necessarily sterile. Both give wearers some protection from things that might splash into their mouths or noses, but their main role in a medical context is to protect patients from what might come out of the nose or mouth of the wearer.
N95 masks, usually marketed as respirators by U.S. medical suppliers, have a different purpose — preventing those who wear them from breathing in small airborne particles (the N95 means that they’re supposed to filter out at least 95% of such particles). Construction workers wear them to keep out dust, firefighters wear them to keep out smoke, inhabitants of some cities wear them to keep out air pollution, and medical practitioners wear them to keep out bacteria and viruses from highly infectious patients. Most are made of spun-bonded polypropylene, and they tend to be stiff, not super-comfortable and a little hard to breathe through. If you don’t put them on just right, you also forgo much of their protection.
I offer this primer (which is not based on great expertise, so please let me know if I got anything wrong, or if you can explain to me how melt-blowing works) because health officials in Western countries have been giving some pretty confounding advice about the use of masks in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. For example, this tweet last week by Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams:
“Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!
They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”
As many people responded, and as sociologist Zeynep Tufekci summed up in a New York Times op-ed article: “How do these masks magically protect the wearers ... only if they work in a particular field?”
The answer is that there’s no magic. N95 respirator masks can protect their wearers even if they’re not health care providers, and it’s not that hard to put them on correctly. The problem is that the nation’s hospitals have been running out amid a crush of coronavirus patients, and the people working there really ought to get first priority. Also, having tried wearing N95 masks during past visits to polluted Chinese cities and having found the experience so unpleasant that I decided to suck in deadly particulates instead, I am dubious that many people not in situations of intense peril would really wear the things consistently enough to protect themselves.
Procedural and surgical masks are cheaper and more comfortable than N95 masks. They don’t offer much protection from disease for their wearers, but do seem to protect everybody else from wearers with infectious diseases. Their widespread use in China and several other Asian countries since January is increasingly being credited with slowing the spread of COVID-19 there. If Western countries want to restart their economies safely if and when the stay-at-home orders succeed in halting the spread of the virus, the wearing of such masks should probably be strongly encouraged.
But they’re in short supply now, too, with hospitals being forced to sew their own surgical masks and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting that in a pinch maybe a bandanna will do. Production is ramping up, but the demand is worldwide and most are made far from the U.S. (this is somewhat less true for N95 respirators, of which Minnesota-based 3M is a leading manufacturer), so I’m not expecting drugstore shelves here to be full of them any time soon. I checked online to see if the Walgreens Earloop-Style Face Mask could be purchased at any of the company’s stores right now, and the answer seems to be no, they’re sold out pretty much everywhere.
According to the Walgreens COVID-19 information page, meanwhile, it’s a “fact” that “Face masks will not prevent COVID-19 spread. Only patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and health care workers caring for them should wear masks.” Again, as in the surgeon general’s statement, the argument seems to be that face masks don’t stop COVID-19 from spreading, except when worn by certain people. Which is of course nonsense.
The concern that panic buying of surgical masks will keep them out of the hands of those who need them most is, on the other hand, not nonsense. It was shared by officials in Singapore early in the spread of what they called the “Wuhan virus,” with one government minister reportedly expressing consternation at Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s practice of wearing masks in her public appearances, saying that if he and his colleagues did that the Singapore hospital system “would have broken down” because of mask shortages. Instead of telling people not to wear masks, though, Singaporean authorities announced at the end of January that they would be giving four procedural masks to each of the nation’s 1.3 million households (about two-thirds of whom eventually took the government up on the offer), and asked that they be used sparingly. “You only wear a mask if you are not well and you have to go out to see a doctor,” said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. “Those who are well do not need to wear a mask.”
As a statement of priority that’s fine, but given that there’s some evidence of the new coronavirus being transmitted by people who haven’t developed symptoms yet, it does seem like it could help if mask-wearing were more widespread than that. The head of the Centre for Infection at the University of Hong Kong suggested last week, for example, that non-mask-wearers be banned from public transit there for the time being. In Japan, where mask-wearing has long been common, it seems to be one of the most plausible explanations for why the new coronavirus has spread so slowly amid a government response less vigorous than what is now being seen in much of the rest of the world.
The wearing of surgical masks in Japan dates back to the influenza pandemic of 1918-19, according to a brief 2014 history by journalist Jeff Yang in Quartz. By the end of that pandemic, mask-wearing was common all over the world, including in the U.S., but in Japan a major earthquake and subsequent fires in and around Tokyo in 1923 led people to get their old flu masks out of storage to protect against the smoke and ash. Another flu epidemic in 1934 “cemented Japan’s love affair with the face mask,” Yang wrote, “which began to be worn with regularity during the winter months — primarily, given Japan’s obsession with social courtesy, by cough-and-cold victims seeking to avoid transmitting their germs to others, rather than healthy people looking to prevent the onset of illness.”
The practice then spread elsewhere in East Asia, with big boosts in recent decades from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2003 and China’s huge air-pollution problems. (Surgical and procedural masks don’t give as much protection against airborne particulates as N95 masks do, but they do give some.) The result was that most people in most East Asian countries seem to have already had a box of procedural masks or the like in the closet before the new coronavirus made its appearance, and that manufacturers in the region already had reason to make far more such masks every year than was needed just to supply the health care sector.
Given the lack of such consumer demand in the West in the past, it shouldn’t be that big a surprise, or that big an indictment of our politicians and public-health authorities, that we can’t even contemplate having enough procedural or surgical masks for everybody to wear anytime soon. This is no reason to deny that masks can be useful, though.
It’s also no reason to despair. Homemade cloth masks, scarves and bandannas aren’t as effective at keeping germs in as three-ply disposable surgical masks are, but they aren’t totally ineffective, either. They also serve the same signaling purpose that masks seem to in Japan and elsewhere — steer clear, I might be contagious. I have a slight fever at the moment, and have been wearing a bandanna over my mouth and nose when I take the dog out for walks. People give me a pretty wide berth!
Also, if we’re lucky enough that the spread of the coronavirus slows during the Northern Hemisphere summer, some Western countries maybe just could, with government encouragement, have enough procedural masks on hand for widespread public use during its likely fall rebound. Then, after COVID-19 has been vanquished or at least rendered relatively harmless, we Westerners might want to consider getting into the habit of putting on procedural masks to go out in public whenever we have a fever or even the sniffles. I’m guessing it could save thousands of lives even in normal flu seasons, and would leave us far better prepared for the next pandemic."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/questions-about-medical-evacuation-during-a-pandemic/569136622/,StarTribune,Questions about medical evacuation during a pandemic,"I travel a lot, but I've never bought travel insurance. I have no medical conditions, and I know that my credit cards will reimburse me if I charge the entire trip on them, and need to cancel before departure if I get sick, or someone close to me becomes ill or injured — the primary reason why people make a travel insurance claim (check if yours does; not all credit cards offer cancellation reimbursement).
But I do buy an annual emergency evacuation membership, in the belief that if I'm severely injured or hospitalized far from home, I'd prefer treatment in a city or hospital of my choice. Since I'm now on Medicare, which doesn't cover me when I travel abroad, I'd want to get back to the U.S. as quickly as possible before the bills pile up in a foreign hospital.
But not until the current coronavirus pandemic did I realize that these medevac plans can't guarantee service if a country is on lockdown, as Italy now is, or if governments decree a complete cessation of air traffic between a country and the United States, as is the current case for China, or if I'm stuck under quarantine.
Several firms offer medevac coverage — it's not insurance, per se, the issuing companies are obliged to explain, but a ""membership"" — offering a wide range of plans: single trip, short term, annual, etc. Among them: MedJet (medjetassist.com), Global Rescue (globalrescue.com), International SOS (internationalsos.com), Global Guardian Air Ambulance Card (airambulancecard.com) and AirMed (airmed.com). It's also included in some standard travel insurance policies, such as those offered by Allianz Travel and AIG Travel Guard, although I prefer to buy directly from the membership plan. You can also compare some plans at sites such as travelinsurance.com.
Questions to ask
You'll want to know how much this protection costs, but also what the fine print says.
Is the medevac plan sold by a broker or directly by the company providing the airlift?
Will your airlift be on a commercial airliner, or on a dedicated air ambulance with whatever medical staff is required?
• Is there an age limit?
• Are pre-existing conditions covered?
• Is there a dollar limit to coverage?
• Which countries are covered?
• How far from home or your preferred medical facility must you be before coverage is valid?
• And perhaps most important, can you choose where to be treated once you're evacuated? (Some plans, such as one that comes as a free benefit of the American Express Platinum Card, will only deliver you to the nearest appropriate medical facility.) This is especially important for people in an HMO or with other managed medical insurance that requires the use of specific hospitals.
But as MedJet spokesperson Geoffrey Weill points out, even the best plan may not help if air traffic, whether commercial airline or air ambulance, has ceased by government decree, or if you're under quarantine either on land or, as in the case of passengers on at least two Princess Cruise Line ships, at sea.
And it stands to reason that in a pandemic it might be difficult for the medevac industry to transport everyone at once. There are only so many aircraft and health care professionals.
Bottom line: An emergency medical evacuation can cost over $100,000. It can bankrupt you. And although it doesn't work in all situations, as I've now discovered, it can be a lifesaver."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/amid-spreading-virus-first-responders-try-to-keep-themselves-safe/569128802/,StarTribune,"Amid spreading virus, first responders try to keep themselves safe","As police around the country grapple with their role in the coronavirus response, they are confronted with another challenge: keeping their own officers safe.
The New York Police Department has already had more than 2,700 police officers and civilian workers call out sick with flu-like symptoms, according to news reports. Cities from Tampa to Boston to Los Angeles have also had officers fall ill with the virus. And a St. Paul police sergeant tested positive for COVID-19 after returning home from vacation last week, according to a department e-mail obtained by the Star Tribune.
He received the diagnosis before returning to work and assured colleagues that health officials do not believe he could have infected anyone before he left. The sergeant is now quarantined for two weeks with his immediate family.
“Like most of you, I accept the risks that come with this job, but I refuse to unnecessarily risk my family or the public,” he wrote, adding that he has no underlying health conditions. “I don’t mind being sick, but I’m infuriated that perhaps someone else’s negligence may have caused me to get sick. … Please remember how easily this virus infects, even when an individual does not have symptoms.”
Two Minneapolis police officers tested negative for coronavirus as calls grow louder for strengthening protections of cops and other front-line workers in the unfolding pandemic.
The officers were sent home after showing symptoms of the virus. MPD spokesman John Elder on Wednesday said that the officers self-quarantined until their test results came back. He said the department hasn’t yet considered testing officers as a precautionary step. “If we have people who are ill, we’re sending them to their medical providers,” he said.
In St. Paul, Chief Todd Axtell temporarily reinstituted the no-beard policy, ordering officers to shave their facial hair so masks will properly seal around their mouths. Patrol officers have been equipped with gloves, safety glasses and hand sanitizer, while detectives were instructed to keep an extra uniform in their office in case need to replace 911 responders who fall sick.
“I think they’re doing the best they can with the resources they have,” Police Federation President Paul Kuntz said of top brass’ response. New guidelines include recalibrating work schedules to limit interactions between officers on opposite shifts and enhanced social distancing techniques in the field, such as interviewing individuals outside their homes.
“When people call 911, our officers are going to respond — it might just look a little different,” said St. Paul department spokesman Steve Linders. “We’re going to be there for [residents] when they need us.”
The St. Paul Fire Department on Friday plans to swear in 17 new firefighters — a month early — to push more first responders on the street. In recent days, more than 70 firefighters have reported potential exposure while dealing with patients exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, said Deputy Fire Chief Roy Mokosso. But all were wearing protective gear. Four firefighters have tested negative for the virus and six others are in self-quarantine due to recent travel, he said.
Meanwhile, Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher issued directives requiring patrol deputies to don N95 masks while they are out of their squad car on service calls that might require them to get within 6 feet of a person. Anyone arrested by their agency will also be placed in a surgical mask — whether they have symptoms or not — before being booked into jail.
“Being on the ‘front lines’ against an invisible enemy is something we are not accustomed to,” Fletcher wrote in an e-mail to staff. “Unfortunately, this enemy is equally deadly to the ones we normally see. You must protect yourself and your family for the next 100 days.”
On Thursday, a coalition of lawmakers and union officials held a news conference at the State Capitol to drum up support for expanding workers’ compensation protections for police officers, firefighters, nurses and corrections officers who test positive for COVID-19. Without these protections, first responders must prove that they contracted the virus on the job to qualify for paid sick benefits, the coalition said.
“I’m ashamed that we’re asking them not only to put their physical health on the line for us, but also their financial health,” said Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud. He and other speakers urged Gov. Tim Walz to issue an executive order creating a “workers’ comp presumption” for affected first responders.
Proponents had hoped those protections would be rolled into the $356 million emergency coronavirus aid package that Minnesota legislators are expected to pass Thursday, but it wasn’t included.
After Walz’s announcement last week ordering the closure of most nonessential businesses, Minneapolis police leaders issued a departmentwide directive outlining guidelines and procedures aimed at limiting officers’ exposure.
Minneapolis homicide detectives, who haven’t been given masks, have been forced to change their investigative techniques: for instance, keeping their distance at crime scenes and instructing masked officers on how to examine a body and look for evidence nearby. And interviews with suspects and witnesses are now mostly being done in the field instead of bringing them back to the station.
Chief Medaria Arradondo said in a statement this week that the department has begun to shift its patrol priorities based on the “expertise of our public health officials” to “optimize the benefits to all.”
“We will continue to look after our city by keeping it safe and we will lean into spaces that will allow us to assist our most vulnerable populations with an emphasis on our seniors and those experiencing homelessness,” he said.
If officers from a particular shift become ill, the department will backfill their positions with detectives and members of specialized units like the Community Engagement Team. Elder said the department also has mutual aid agreements with other local law enforcement agencies to help fill service gaps.
“[If] St. Paul gets hit, you may see Minneapolis officers in St. Paul, and vice versa,” Elder said, while adding that an internal audit revealed that fewer officers had called out sick in recent weeks compared to the same period last year. “We’re not seeing this rash of sickness that some people were expecting.”"
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/refugees-in-limbo-as-flights-canceled/569059002/,StarTribune,Refugees in limbo as flights canceled,"Hassan Sharif stocked up on extra food and made plans to move into a bigger apartment as he prepared for his 14-year-old daughter Mustariya’s arrival in Minneapolis from Ethiopia. She had her bags packed and her refugee travel documents in hand when she got notice that her flight had been abruptly canceled.
“She said, ‘It broke my heart,’ ” Sharif recalled. “She was crying bout it.”The spread of COVID-19 prompted the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees and International Organization for Migration last week to temporarily suspend refugee flights, prompting confusion and disappointment among the Twin Cities refugees who were waiting to be reunited with family members.
It has also raised concern among some refugee advocates that disruptions caused by the virus make it less likely that the U.S. will hit even the historically low ceiling of refugee admissions set by the White House last fall.
Meanwhile, refugees who recently arrived in the U.S. are scrambling like everyone else to cope with layoffs and with children sent home from shuttered schools, while they also contend with the added burdens of being less economically stable and having difficulty with the English language.
Refugee resettlement agencies participated in a conference call last Wednesday with the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration about the suspended flights.
The refugee office in the Minnesota Department of Human Services is worried that some refugees who are newer to working in the state will be affected by unemployment insurance rules that base benefits on earnings received over the last year.
The agency has reached out to the federal government to seek flexibility in how it spends its federal funds during the pandemic.
“We’re trying to figure out how we can identify what those particular gaps might be for people who are within a year of arrival, and see how we can work to make sure that we can help them stabilize through this challenging time,” said Rachele King, refugee resettlement coordinator for the agency.
King said refugees are in a similar situation to Minnesotans living on the margins and trying to build economic stability. Maureen Warren of Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota said her organization has heard from some recently arrived refugees who lost their jobs and are now looking for employment at grocery stores.
“The hospitality industry has been a major employer of refugees, so with travel down, folks working various jobs in hotels are experiencing some layoffs,” said Warren, who is vice president and chief family services officer.
Sharif, 36, fled political persecution in Ethiopia in 2007 and lived in Kenya until coming to the U.S. as a refugee in 2016. He found a job at a packaging company, rented a studio apartment in Minneapolis, and learned some English. Speaking in Oromo through a translator, he told the Star Tribune that he had long hoped for his daughter to join him in America, and now worries whether her travel documents will expire by the time the suspension is lifted.
Sharif said he wished that he could go to Addis Ababa to bring her here himself. But he said he has tried to stay strong and is continuing to work, though his employer offered staff two weeks of paid sick leave.
Sharif’s daughter was supposed to be resettled through the International Institute of Minnesota. Its director of refugee services, Micaela Schuneman, said cancellations have been coming in since Monday.
“The concern for us when a case gets canceled and is not rescheduled right away is that some of the background checks, medical checks and other things expire. ... So they’ll have to start some of those processes over, and it can really cause long delays for them to be booked for travel,” Schuneman said.
With the U.S. behind on accepting the federal limit of 18,000 refugees this year, she added, “this definitely would cause a big disruption.”
On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar wrote a letter to House leadership requesting that funding for refugee admissions be included in future coronavirus emergency legislation, that refugee admissions be quickly resumed and that the administration extend validity periods for visas and security checks to account for delays caused by the virus.
Arrive Ministries was set to welcome a Karen family from Thailand soon but just learned that their flight was canceled.
“I know [their Minnesota relatives] have been waiting a very long time, so I think this will be pretty disappointing for them,” said Krista Allgor, director of arrival services.
The resettlement agency is working with refugees who have been in America for as little as a few weeks and are now finding their hopes of getting a job and establishing themselves disrupted by the pandemic.
English classes and cultural orientations are on hold or delayed, and Arrive Ministries staff must work with clients over the phone instead of in person.
Refugees who are newer to Minnesota are also struggling to comprehend the drastic changes in American life. The Karen Organization of Minnesota has shifted its work with clients to the phone and is trying to get out accurate information to a community struggling to follow the news in English.
Co-executive director Eh Tah Khu said Karen refugees fear anti-Asian bias — and being mistaken for Chinese though they are an ethnic minority from Burma.
He said parents are concerned about leaving their teenagers unsupervised and seeing them get into trouble now that schools are closing. He says many are loading up on bags of rice, fearful about losing access to a dietary staple.
“I think it would be helpful for the Karen community to have reliable information in Karen that they can understand coming directly from an organization or a department that’s well-known and people can trust,” Khu said."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-businesses-praise-flexibility-in-walz-stay-at-home-order/569132452/,StarTribune,Minnesota businesses praise flexibility in Gov. Tim Walz's stay-at-home order,"Minnesota’s largest business groups are giving broad support to Gov. Tim Walz’s stay-at-home executive order, calling it a measured approach that keeps key industries functioning while curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
At the same time, they want government leaders to remain flexible on the definition of “essential” business because needs may change in coming weeks. In announcing the stay-at-home order Wednesday afternoon, Walz urged more businesses to close but gave exemptions to many.
“Anytime you create an exhaustive list like this there’s going to be pieces of the business supply chain that will not be recognized and should have been considered,” Minnesota Chamber of Commerce President Doug Loon said.
Walz’s two-week “stay-at-home” order begins at 11:59 p.m. Friday. It asks Minnesotans to stay in their homes unless absolutely necessary, after models suggest that the state will run out of hospital intensive-care capacity before infection rates of the coronavirus peak.
Only businesses working in critical sectors will be able to remain open, but the definition is fairly broad. It includes health care workers, emergency responders, law enforcement, shelters and child care as well as construction, food production, utilities, the news media and critical manufacturing.
About 78% of jobs in the state fall into one of the critical industries, according to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED).
“Leading up to this there was a great deal of uncertainty about what would be included in the definition of essential services of what would be included,” Loon said. “This brings a level of certainty about short-term impacts on the economy.”
Charlie Weaver, who leads the Minnesota Business Partnership, an association of top executives, said in a statement that the order “allows our state to effectively confront this public health threat while ensuring key sectors of our economy continue to function.”
Minnesota officials have set up a website with a form to help businesses determine whether they are deemed essential and to consider exemptions for companies that believe their work should not have been excluded.
DEED is evaluating inquiries and will get back to businesses within 24 hours, Commissioner Steve Grove said Thursday.
“It’s really important to us that businesses feel taken care of, feel that they’re getting responses quickly, and understand this order and what it means for them,” Grove said.
“For many businesses it’s not either/or,” he said. “Some businesses have some workers that are critical and some workers who are not. There may be some nuance there that each business needs to get guidance on.”
Noncritical businesses that continue operating risk being charged with a willful violation, a misdemeanor that carries a fine of up to $1,000 and up to 90 days in jail.
Bars and restaurants, already ordered closed, will remain shuttered through May 1, according to the new order.
Businesses and manufacturers are retooling to adapt to changing needs of the marketplace, blurring the lines for what is critical. Business groups lobbied Minnesota lawmakers for a broad interpretation.
This means that specialty fabric stores that sell material used to make masks could remain open. Also covered are companies that have retooled, such as MyPillow, which has dedicated 75% of its production to supply health care workers with face masks.
“There’s a lot of ripple effects,” said the Chamber of Commerce’s Loon. “We’ve got to make sure the exemptions for essential services are dynamic so those critically important new suppliers are accommodated.”
Plunkett’s Pest Control owner Stacy O’Reilly said her company will still be available to get that raccoon out of your attic or the bat that flew down the chimney.
Hardware and paint stores will stay open, as many also serve as suppliers to contractors and those in the construction trade, which are considered essential.
“We’re quite cognizant that change can come at any time with very short notice,” said Jeff Lien, marketing manager for Hirshfield’s Inc., which no longer allows anyone but employees inside its 32 stores.
The retailer now uses curbside delivery or has customers and contractors wait at the door to pick up items ordered on the phone or online.
Demand for paint, which makes up the bulk of Hirshfield’s overall sales, has gotten an unanticipated uptick.
“People are in lockdown, and I think it’s comforting to keep busy,” said Michelle Picha, a 26-year veteran of Hirschfield’s who works at the Edina store. “We haven’t been this busy in years.”"
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/voting-changes-eyed-for-covid-19-outbreak/569141702/,StarTribune,Minnesota considers voting changes for 2020 with COVID-19 outbreak,"Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said Thursday that he is considering mail-in balloting and expanded absentee voting to keep Minnesota’s August primary and November general election on track amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It is important that we be prepared for a different kind of election than we’re used to,” Simon said. “There are many options available, and which one we use will depend on what our world looks like on Election Day.”
Simon said those options include mailing each registered voter a ballot to complete at home and return by mail. His office could also encourage Minnesotans to vote absentee.
Simon is looking to reduce the number of polling places by limiting polling locations to centralized facilities and moving them out of areas deemed vulnerable, such as senior care centers.
“No one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote,” Simon said.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., also has been trying to pass federal legislation that would expand early voting and absentee voting by mail in all states. Her plan would reimburse states for the extra costs associated with administering elections during the pandemic.
The $2.2 trillion emergency COVID-19 aid package approved by the U.S. Senate late Wednesday provides $400 million for states to get started on such measures. But Klobuchar said Thursday that the amount was “not enough.” Her legislation, sponsored alongside U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would also provide money to hire and train new poll workers in anticipation that current workers who are vulnerable to the virus may need to stay home.
“There’s no reason we can’t get on top of this,” Klobuchar said. “There might have been issues with people ... not getting the testing out there. We don’t want to have that happen to our entire democracy.”
Simon’s initiative follows recommendations by a new bipartisan National Task Force on Election Crises, which urged election officials nationwide to deem the coronavirus a “legally sufficient ‘excuse’ to enable absentee voting by all eligible voters.”"
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-is-doing-just-fine-with-the-defense-production-act/569140612/,StarTribune,Trump is doing just fine with the Defense Production Act,"President Donald Trump can’t do right by some critics no matter what he does. For three years he’s been denounced as a reckless authoritarian, and now he’s attacked for not being authoritarian enough by refusing to commandeer American industry. The truth is that private industry is responding to the coronavirus without command and control by the federal government.
Last week Trump invoked the 1950 Defense Production Act that lets a president during a national emergency order business to manufacture products for national defense, set wage and price controls and allocate materials. On Tuesday the Federal Emergency Management Agency used the Korean War-era law for the first time in this crisis to procure and distribute testing kits and face masks.
But Democrats want the administration to take over much more of the private economy. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday tweeted that the federal government should “nationalize the medical supply chain” and “order companies to make gowns, masks and gloves.”
Yet businesses across America are already chipping in where they can. Aerospace manufacturer Honeywell plans to hire 500 workers at its plant in Rhode Island, which currently produces safety goggles, to make millions of N95 face masks for medical professionals. 3M has doubled its global output of N95 masks and this week is sending 500,000 respirators to hot spots in the U.S.
Corporations including Apple, Facebook, Tesla and Goldman Sachs are donating millions of medical masks stockpiled for wildfires or a biochemical attack. Apparel manufacturers are repurposing textile mills to produce personal protective equipment. Hanes plans to manufacture masks using U.S. cotton at factories in El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic. Diverse supply chains can help businesses operate more flexibly during a crisis since they don’t depend on any single country for materials or workers. That’s why an America-first or America-only government supply order would be a mistake.
Maine-based Puritan Medical Products, one of America’s top sources for nose swabs, says it has been rushing to keep up with orders even as some workers have become sick. Directing the company to produce more coronavirus swabs won’t do any good if it can’t get more workers and could create a shortage of flu tests if it has to divert resources from other lines.
Businesses know their workforce capacities and supply chains better than the government — and how to retool them to maximize efficiency. Dozens of breweries and distillers including Anheuser-Busch and Pernod Ricard USA are churning out hand sanitizer. General Electric plans to hire more workers to produce ventilators even while it lays off thousands in aviation.
Ford said on Tuesday that it would start assembling plastic face shields and work with 3M and GE to make respirators and ventilators. General Motors is also exploring how to use its global automotive supply chain to make ventilators. Ford’s CEO said its ventilators could be available by June, and it isn’t obvious that a government takeover of manufacturing would speed this up."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/how-the-2020-census-could-be-delayed-by-the-pandemic/569140592/,StarTribune,How the 2020 census could be delayed by the pandemic,"The census is a constitutionally mandated process that has occurred since 1790. It has been administered during a world war, earthquakes, the Great Depression — and now a pandemic.
The coronavirus presents a particular challenge to the 2020 census — which kicked off earlier this month — because human transmission of the virus has prompted public health officials to discourage public gatherings and limit social interactions. Most of us are self-isolating at home.
Historically, the census involves workers knocking on doors, and rallies and community meetings to raise awareness. Many such events have been canceled, and the Census Bureau is emphasizing digital outreach. “It has never been easier to respond ... without having to meet a census taker,” the bureau announced recently.
Yet grassroots organizations and local census “complete count committees” had been planning to use public spaces such as libraries and community centers to raise awareness about the census — and help communities fill out the survey. New and emerging guidelines regarding the coronavirus will likely hamstring their efforts to meet with as many people as possible face-to-face.
Limiting public interactions poses a particular challenge for the count of Latinos and immigrants, who often depend on in-person interactions to help them understand the census — and its importance to their economic and political power.
If you don’t respond to the census by late April, census takers will probably knock on your door beginning in late May, although the Census Bureau will continue to monitor the impact of the coronavirus on that plan.
Though no physical interaction is required to complete the count, concerns over contracting the virus could affect the traditional door-to-door process.
California’s Dianne Feinstein is among a coalition of U.S. senators who sent a letter to the Census Bureau’s director on March 4 urging it to be prepared to assess whether concerns about the virus are “depressing census response rates” and to develop contingency plans to help ensure “a full and accurate population count.”
Regardless of any challenges, the mission of the census has always remained the same: By trying to count every person in our country, communities attain their rightful share of political representation and federal resources for vital programs such as the early childhood program Head Start and Section 8 housing, which provides subsidies to low-income residents.
The coronavirus is yet another major reminder of why it’s important for our states to have access to accurate census data.
An accurate census count can help ensure that we have the necessary public health services to provide a safety net for those in need, whether that means properly funding community health clinics, ensuring child care needs are met or devoting resources to emergency preparedness.
On March 12, many households across the country received an invitation in the mail to fill out the survey, and more than 11 million people have already responded as of this writing, according to the Census Bureau.
Do your part by giving the census prompt attention — and preventing a census taker from having to knock on your door. It can be filled out online, by phone or via a paper questionnaire that will be sent to households in mid-April as a reminder to fill out the survey.
Ordinary residents can also play a significant role in ensuring an accurate census count. They can raise awareness on social media by reposting key census information from trusted sources such as the state census office. They can engage with relatives, friends and co-workers to see whether they need help understanding how to fill out the census. The young, who are digital natives, can become involved by going online and connecting with neighbors to help them fill out the census.
Local ethnic media, including radio, should augment census awareness campaigns, especially for non-English speakers.
In 2020, the coronavirus and the census count are inextricably linked. People across the country should view filling out the census the same way they do the increased need to wash their hands — as a civic duty."
"March 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/hennepin-county-weekly-cost-of-housing-homeless-during-pandemic-could-reach-1-million/569128792/,StarTribune,Hennepin County: Weekly cost of housing homeless during pandemic could reach $1 million,"Despite new emergency coronavirus state aid, local government and nonprofit leaders issued separate calls Thursday for more state funding to shield the homeless during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying they are currently unprepared for a virus they predict will “spread like wildfire” through their shelters.
Hennepin County officials told commissioners that the cost for housing the homeless during the crisis could hit $1 million per week — a price 25 times higher than its typical weekly expenditure and one they warned the county cannot bear alone.
“There needs to be state help here. Hennepin County can’t shoulder the burden,” County Administrator David Hough said.
Meanwhile, leaders of homeless organizations from Duluth to Rochester said Thursday in a virtual news conference that they need more money and resources, such as access to hotel rooms to house people and sports arenas to serve meals. They also urged the state to increase rental assistance to prevent people from becoming homeless during the economic downturn.
Tim Marx, CEO of Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, said the outbreak has cost the organization at least $1 million more a month for extra cleaning, supplies, staffing and food.
On Friday, Ramsey County will open a temporary quarantine facility for single adults with COVID-19 symptoms at Mary Hall, leased from Catholic Charities in St. Paul. The site will provide symptom monitoring, security and transportation.
“The situation is becoming even more dire,” Marx said, adding that homeless shelters are essentially field hospitals for the poor. “We need more support and we need more resources, and we urgently need them now.”
The infection is still in its early stages in the state, and the number of beds needed for the infected and at-risk homeless could climb steeply.
The state’s record high number of homeless people don’t have a home to hunker down in, with some left to live in cars, camps or storage buildings. At shelters, social distancing rules aren’t possible with bunk beds and floor mats bunched together.
About 80% of homeless adults have chronic health conditions, mental illness, or substance abuse issues, according to new research released Wednesday from St. Paul-based Wilder Research, factors which make them more vulnerable during the COVID-19 outbreak.
In regular circumstances, Hennepin, the state’s most populous county, spends about $40,000 weekly on housing for the homeless. That doesn’t include food, health care or transportation. The county generally has about 2,000 homeless residents each night, including 600 without shelter, and accounts for about half the state’s homeless population.
“In any economic crisis, the people who have the least are affected the most,” said David Hewitt, the county’s director of the Office to End Homelessness.
Hennepin County leaders have made it clear, privately and publicly, that the county can’t bear the entire cost of helping the homeless in a pandemic. One commissioner said the county will need help when it reaches 300 homeless residents affected by the virus, and it’s already approaching that number.
Daniel Rogan, Hennepin County’s assistant administrator for operations, described the staggering potential scope of the situation. The county currently has 306 beds that qualify as quarantine and isolation units, many of them in hotels. Already 190 are being used by individuals at high risk of contracting the virus, and another 19 are occupied by residents who are symptomatic, Rogan said.
The County Board voted last week to give administrators up to $3 million to arrange isolation and quarantine efforts for the homeless during the pandemic. Similarly, Ramsey County agreed to spend nearly $2 million to open more space in St. Paul.
The situation outside the Twin Cities was said to be no better. In Rochester, the Dorothy Day House closed because of the outbreak. Olmsted County is now using a hall in the Mayo Civic Center to house people and keep them 6 feet apart, and contracting with hotel rooms for 15 high-risk people, Commissioner Sheila Kiscaden said.
In Duluth, the CHUM Center and Emergency Shelter, St. Louis County’s largest emergency shelter, has stepped up cleaning, health screenings, and buying thermometers to take temperatures, said Lee Stuart, the executive director. She said about 140 people stayed at the shelter and drop-in center Wednesday while about 150 others in Duluth remained unsheltered. Stuart said CHUM would need $70,000 a month to open another shelter and $250,000 a month to open a 24/7 quarantine facility.
As Hennepin County seeks more space, shelters struggle to adjust their operations. Shelters are losing volunteers as demands increase and they do additional cleaning.
Residents can no longer congregate for meals in a cafeteria. Some shelters are trying to stay open during the day when they are traditionally closed.
In Minneapolis, Monica Nilsson, shelter director of Strong Tower Parish and Elim Church Shelters, said men and women — some of whom are sick — must are sleep on rows of mats 2 feet apart.
Simpson Housing Services of Minneapolis extended its shelter hours to 24/7, but executive director Steve Horsfield said more needs to be done. Once a shelter has a case of COVID-19, he said, “It’s going to spread like wildfire.”"

St. Luke's has asked employees to reduce hours and laid off seven people, as the ban on elective surgeries and nonessential appointments has left some workers idled and slashed revenue, said Chief Medical Officer Dr. Nicholas Van Deelen.
""Once the surge arrives, it will be all hands on deck,"" Van Deelen said at a news conference Thursday. ""Until then we're in this no man's land where we have to be very good stewards of the resources we have.""
Essentia Health, Duluth's largest employer, is taking a look at who can be put on administrative leave before an abundance of work is expected.
""If we don't have money to pay people to be here when we really have the surge, that's going to be creating problems,"" said Dr. Jon Pryor, president of Essentia's northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin operations. ""All of our attention needs to be on preparing for the surge.""
He said Essentia has not yet laid off workers and is ""trying not to reduce hours,"" but hundreds of job postings were taken down over the weekend. The openings that remain are nearly all physicians.
Pryor said the health system has ""slowed down, postponed or rescinded some offers,"" while some openings continue to be filled.
Essentia has more than 6,500 employees, and St. Luke's has about 2,000. Together they comprise about 15% of the city's total workforce.
Both hospitals are redirecting and retraining staff to prepare for a cascade of cases.
""What they're really focused on is when that surge hits — how are we going to care for 400 patients?"" said Pete Boyechko, a St. Luke's nurse and Minnesota Nurses Association bargaining leader. ""It's the calm before the perceived storm.""
Boyechko said some nurses have volunteered to trim their hours, with the anticipation they'll see their workloads grow soon. But if the rush of coronavirus cases doesn't show up in the next few weeks as anticipated, more layoffs are on the table, he said.
""We're all working together to figure this out,"" he said. ""Communication is the toughest part.""
There are now five confirmed cases of COVID-19 in St. Louis County, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. The first was confirmed Saturday, and none have required hospitalizations so far, according to the county.
Across the border in Douglas County, Wisconsin, there were four confirmed cases as of Thursday; each was recovering at home.
A St. Luke's employee is one of the confirmed cases; the health system said the infection was travel-related.
""Contact tracing has already taken place, and all close contacts have been notified,"" spokeswoman Melissa Burlaga said. ""St. Luke's Occupational Health has been working with the employee and completed an investigation into the employee's contacts and followed up.""
Health officials are urging residents to act as if the virus is being transmitted in their community, to follow the governor's order to stay home, to remain at least six feet from others and to wash hands well and often.
""The most important thing right now is what you do,"" Van Deelen said."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-congressional-delegation-unites-for-covid-response/569158772/,StarTribune,Minnesota congressional delegation unites for COVID response,"Minnesotans in Congress lined up Friday behind the $2.2 trillion stimulus package to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, even as they looked ahead to what else is needed to respond to the crisis.
“It’s probably the most important bill a member of Congress has ever voted on,” said Rep. Dean Phillips, a Democrat who represents the western Twin Cities suburbs.
“People are literally losing their lives, getting sick, businesses are shuttering. We need to respond,” said Rep. Pete Stauber, a Republican from northeastern Minnesota.
The House passed the measure Friday by voice vote, following unanimous passage in the U.S. Senate late Wednesday night.
The measure, negotiated by the Trump administration and congressional leaders, includes $500 billion in loans and guarantees to businesses and state and local governments, including about $1.2 billion for Minnesota’s general fund; $350 billion in loans for companies with fewer than 500 employees; $260 billion in emergency unemployment insurance; and $150 billion for health care providers, including direct grants to hospitals.
There are also direct, one-time payments to individuals capped at $1,200 per person, a number that shrinks for those who earn above $75,000 a year; and billions more for disaster relief, schools, transportation systems, veterans, food stamp beneficiaries and numerous other recipients.
While support from Minnesota’s 10-member delegation was on track to be unanimous, Democratic and Republican lawmakers raised concerns, both about what was left out of the package and the process of getting it done.
Rep. Angie Craig, a Democrat who represents southeastern Minnesota including some Twin Cities counties, said there’s not enough money for small towns and cities that are likely to lose major tax revenue due to shuttered businesses in their communities.
“I expect to support the bill and keep fighting for additional needs,” Craig said.
Stauber criticized Democrats for what he described as “a wish list of provisions that have absolutely nothing to do with mitigating the impact of coronavirus.”
The new stimulus package has faced some criticism from the left for what critics have called too much emphasis on bailing out corporations and businesses over helping idled workers.
“The largest corporations stand to access hundreds of billions of dollars with little public oversight,” Take­Action Minnesota, a progressive advocacy and organizing group, said in a news release Thursday. “Meanwhile, the safety net for many classifications of workers and undocumented working families is nonexistent.”
While acknowledging some of those concerns, Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minneapolis, said the crisis is too big to wait.
“We have a package that will help relieve some economic anxieties, help create relief for many parts of our state and country,” Omar said. Still, she said Congress and the Trump administration would likely need to consider more direct relief to individuals.
Rep. Tom Emmer of central Minnesota also supported the stimulus measure. He was one of 40 House Republicans to vote against the prior corona­virus response bill earlier this month, saying lawmakers had been given virtually no time to consider complex, far-reaching legislation."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/returning-to-normal-is-too-dangerous-to-contemplate/569174392/,StarTribune,Returning to normal is too dangerous to contemplate,"President Donald Trump says he wants the United States “raring to go” in 2 ½ weeks, on Easter, with “packed churches all over our country.” He and many other political conservatives suggest that we are responding to something like the flu with remedies that may be more devastating than the disease.
We created a model with epidemiologists to show that returning to normal quickly could be a historic mistake that would lead to an explosion of infections, hospitalizations and deaths.
Instead, health experts advise giving current business closures and social distancing a month to slow the pandemic, buying time to roll out mass testing and equip doctors with protective equipment. Then, depending on where we are, we can think about easing up — while prepared for a new burst of infections that will then require a new clampdown.
“Anyone advising the end of social distancing now needs to fully understand what the country will look like if we do that,” cautioned Dr. Tom Inglesby, a health security expert at Johns Hopkins University. “COVID would spread widely, rapidly, terribly, and could kill potentially millions in the year ahead, with huge social and economic impact.”
Social distancing may delay an outbreak more than prevent it, but it is beneficial in two ways.
First, we can use the time to buttress hospitals and test treatments. Second, interventions can flatten the curve and spread infections over a longer time so that the health care system does not become overwhelmed.
Whatever we do, the pain of both disease and business and school closures may be enormous. During the Great Depression, the jobless rate reached 25%; today, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard, warns that it might reach 30%. People may lose their jobs, savings and homes; they will go without parties, weddings, funerals and graduations that give life connectedness and meaning.
But we know quite a bit about how to ease economic pain: We can send out checks to individuals, and we can incentivize companies to keep workers on the payrolls. Both steps are part of legislation passed this week in Washington.
Some prominent conservatives have suggested that it is worth sacrificing some elderly people to keep the economy moving. “I’d rather die than kill the country,” Glenn Beck told viewers.
But that view reflects two fallacies. First, the fundamental force damaging the economy is not the rule book on social distancing but rather an out-of-control virus, and the best way to protect the economy is to rein in the pandemic. Second, while these critics speak nobly about sacrificing themselves, the policies they advocate would more likely lead to the deaths of many other people who are older and in poorer shape.
It is a false choice to say that we must accept the deaths of senior citizens to keep small businesses going. And any easing of social distancing should be based on data.
Dr. Larry Brilliant, an epidemiologist who is a veteran of the eradication of smallpox and now chairman of an organization called Ending Pandemics, warned that if Trump sends everyone back to work by Easter, “I think history would judge it an error of epic proportions.”
Brilliant said that the entire country probably does not need to be shut down but that we need widespread testing to determine which areas are at risk and which are not. We also desperately need blood testing to determine who has had the disease and is now immune.
If COVID-19 is as fearsome as some believe, our model suggests a grim possibility: It may be that the only way to control it sustainably is with an economic pause too long to be politically sustainable. In that case, we may be headed for a year of alternating periods of easing and tightening economic activity, with the pandemic rising whenever we ease and subsiding whenever we tighten.
Dr. David Fisman, a University of Toronto epidemiologist who helped us build this model, suggests that for the next year we may have to tighten social distancing whenever intensive care unit capacity is stretched, and then loosen it when the situation improves. “This gives the economy and the population ‘breaks’ so that people can breathe and businesses can operate,” Fisman said.
There are some hopeful signs that social distancing and business closures can turn the tide, and not just in South Korea and Singapore. In Italy, confirmed new cases have started to drop. And the number of positive test results conducted by the University of Washington, in hard-hit Seattle has stabilized.
Trump seems to be pushing for a relaxation of restrictions partly based on his repeated comparisons of COVID-19 to the flu, warning that “we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.” Meanwhile, Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel scoffed this month about the coronavirus: “Worst-case scenario, it could be the flu.”
Modeling the virus underscores why epidemiologists emphasize that this is not the flu and why we should not expect a return to normal within weeks.
One gauge of a virus is how contagious it is. The flu has an infectiousness measure (or R0) of only about 1.5, meaning that each sick person infects on average 1.5 others. In contrast, COVID-19 without social distancing appears to have an R0 of perhaps 2.5.
A second gauge of a virus is how often infected people must be hospitalized. With the seasonal flu that’s roughly 1%; with the coronavirus, estimates range from 5% to 20%.
A higher R0 and higher hospitalization rate conspire to wreak havoc. A single person with the flu can result in the infections of 386 other people over two months, and a handful would be hospitalized. But in that same period one COVID-19 patient could lead to the infections of 99,000 people, of whom nearly 20,000 might need to be hospitalized.
A third measure is lethality, the “case fatality rate,” or percentage of people who contract an illness who eventually die of it. For the flu, this is about 0.1%. For COVID-19, there are enormous uncertainties but even in optimal circumstances it may be 10 times greater, roughly 1% — although it has been much higher than that in countries like Italy with older populations and overburdened hospitals.
We asked Dr. Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University, what she would advise a bride and groom whose long-planned wedding is imminent, especially if they can’t afford to reschedule. “They should think about putting other people at risk,” she said, “and what would they think if there was an outbreak because of something happy like a wedding.”
These are not questions we wrestle with each flu season.
We’re living through an extraordinary time, forced to make difficult trade-offs with uncertain information — and one lesson of past pandemics is that early “knowledge” of diseases is often wrong. Yet another lesson of history is the value of responding to pandemics early and firmly. In the 1918 flu pandemic, cities like St. Louis that acted decisively saved many lives. In this crisis, parts of the world like South Korea and Taiwan that acted resolutely have managed far better than those that were more relaxed, like Italy, Iran and the United States.
That’s why epidemiologists and public health experts warn against relaxing too soon. Dr. Peter Hotez, a global health expert at Baylor College of Medicine, calls for maintaining controls for at least another month and then reassessing.
Life is about making difficult decisions in the context of uncertainty, and we hope our model will help you appreciate the trade-offs — and the significance of sustained efforts for social distancing not only by the president but also by each of us in our own lives."
"March 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/virus-epidemic-leads-some-countries-to-restrict-food-exports/569159842/,StarTribune,Virus epidemic leads some countries to restrict food exports,"It's not just grocery shoppers who are hoarding pantry staples. Some governments are moving to secure domestic food supplies during the conoravirus pandemic.
Kazakhstan, one of the world's biggest shippers of wheat flour, banned exports of that product along with others, including carrots, sugar and potatoes. Vietnam temporarily suspended new rice export contracts. Serbia has stopped the flow of its sunflower oil and other goods, while Russia is leaving the door open to shipment bans and said it's assessing the situation weekly.
To be perfectly clear, there have been just a handful of moves and no sure signs that much more is on the horizon. Still, what's been happening has raised a question: Is this the start of a wave of food nationalism that will further disrupt supply chains and trade flows?
""We're starting to see this happening already -- and all we can see is that the lockdown is going to get worse,"" said Tim Benton, research director in emerging risks at think tank Chatham House in London.
Though food supplies are ample, logistical hurdles are making it harder to get products where they need to be as the coronavirus unleashes unprecedented measures, panic buying and the threat of labor crunches.
Consumers across the globe are still loading their pantries -- and the economic fallout from the virus is just starting. The specter of more trade restrictions is stirring memories of how protectionism can often end up causing more harm than good. That adage rings especially true now as the moves would be driven by anxiety and not made in response to crop failures or other supply problems.
As it is, many governments have employed extreme measures, setting curfews and limits on crowds or even on people venturing out for anything but to acquire essentials. That could spill over to food policy, said Ann Berg, an independent consultant and veteran agricultural trader who started her career at Louis Dreyfus Co. in 1974.
""You could see wartime rationing, price controls and domestic stockpiling,"" she said.
Some nations are adding to their strategic reserves. China, the biggest rice grower and consumer, pledged to buy more than ever before from its domestic harvest, even though the government already holds massive stockpiles of rice and wheat, enough for one year of consumption.
Key wheat importers including Algeria and Turkey have also issued new tenders, and Morocco said a suspension on wheat-import duties would last through mid-June.
As governments take nationalistic approaches, they risk disrupting an international system that has become increasingly interconnected in recent decades.
Kazakhstan had already stopped exports of other food staples, like buckwheat and onions, before the move this week to cut off wheat-flour shipments. That latest action was a much bigger step, with the potential to affect companies around the world that rely on the supplies to make bread.
For some commodities, a handful of countries, or even fewer, make up the bulk of exportable supplies. Disruptions to those shipments would have major global ramifications. Take, for example, Russia, which has emerged as the world's top wheat exporter and a key supplier to North Africa. Vietnam is the third-largest rice exporter, sending many of its cargoes to the Philippines.
""If governments are not working collectively and cooperatively to ensure there is a global supply, if they're just putting their nations first, you can end up in a situation where things get worse,"" said Benton of Chatham House.
He warned that frenzied shopping coupled with protectionist policies could eventually lead to higher food prices -- a cycle that could end up perpetuating itself.
""If you're panic buying on the market for next year's harvest, then prices will go up, and as prices go up, policy makers will panic more,"" he said.
And higher grocery bills can have major ramifications. Bread costs have a long history of kick-starting unrest and political instability. During the food price spikes of 2011 and 2008, there were food riots in more than 30 nations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
""Without the food supply, societies just totally break,"" Benton said.
Unlike previous periods of rampant food inflation, global inventories of staple crops like corn, wheat, soybeans and rice are plentiful, said Dan Kowalski, vice president of research at CoBank, a $145 billion lender to the agriculture industry, adding he doesn't expect ""dramatic"" gains for prices now.
While the spikes of the last decade were initially caused by climate problems for crops, policies exacerbated the consequences. In 2010, Russia experienced a record heat wave that damaged the wheat crop. The government responded by banning exports to make sure domestic consumers had enough.
The United Nations' measure of global food prices reached a record high by February 2011.
""Given the problem that we are facing now, it's not the moment to put these types of policies into place,"" said Maximo Torero, chief economist at the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. ""On the contrary, it's the moment to cooperate and coordinate.""
Of course, the few bans in place may not last, and signs of a return to normal could prevent countries from taking drastic measures. Once consumers start to see more products on shelves, they may stop hoarding, in turn allowing governments to back off. X5 Retail, Russia's biggest grocer, said demand for staple foods is starting to stabilize. In the U.S., major stores like Walmart have cut store hours to allow workers to restock.
In the meantime, some food prices have already started going up because of the spike in buying.
Wheat futures in Chicago, the global benchmark, have climbed more than 6% in March as consumers buy up flour. U.S. wholesale beef has shot up to the highest since 2015, and egg prices are higher.
At the same time, the U.S. dollar is surging against a host of emerging-market currencies. That reduces purchasing power for countries that ship in commodities, which are usually priced in greenbacks.
In the end, whenever there's a disruption for whatever reason, Berg said, ""it's the least-developed countries with weak currencies that get hurt the most."""
"March 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/navigating-fear-and-loathing-in-the-stock-market/569181842/,StarTribune,Navigating fear and loathing in the stock market,"The economic effect of the coronavirus outbreak may have you thinking about — and let’s be real, losing sleep over — your finances now more than ever.
With bills, investments and mortgage payments to consider, as well as looming fears about a recession, you may need an expert opinion to cut through the noise and calm your anxieties.
NerdWallet writers Arielle O’Shea and Kimberly Palmer shared tips at a recent forum on the challenges facing investors trying to navigate their way in one of the most volatile financial markets in history.
Q: What should I do as a long-term investor?
Arielle O’Shea: The stock market is inciting a lot of fear right now. If you are a long-term investor — you are not investing for a goal that is less than five years away, like a down payment for a house you want to buy in a few years — ride it out. The best reaction to these market moves is no reaction at all. People say that the stock market is the only market where people flee the store when things go on sale, but it’s important not to flee the store right now.
Takeaway: When it comes to the stock market, playing the long game is the smartest money move. The best reaction is no reaction at all.
Q: What should I do if I am close to retirement?
O’Shea: If you are near retirement it’s a bit of a different story, but not totally. You don’t stop investing on the day you retire. You need your money to last 20, maybe 30 years, so you should still think of yourself as a long-term investor. Many financial planners recommend having a pot of “safe money,” or cash available in savings or safer investments [such as bonds or target-date funds] that can cover you for at least the first few years of retirement. Take less risk as you approach retirement.
Takeaway: You still have a long time to invest, even if you are close to retirement, but have some “safe” money in cash or other investments — enough to last a few years — and rebalance your portfolio so that you’re minimizing risk.
Q: How can I take control during a time of market volatility?
O’Shea: Control what you can control. See if you can lock in a high-interest rate with a certificate of deposit before rates fall further, shop around to find a high-yield savings account, increase your 401(k) contributions, max out an IRA, or consider investing more in a 529 plan.
Takeaway: Don’t feel stuck. You can still open a CD, explore a high-yield savings account and max out your IRA, among other things.
Q: How should I budget during these times?
Kimberly Palmer: Make sure you have an emergency fund. In general, we recommend saving three to six months’ worth of expenses. It’s also important to apply the 50/30/20 budget — 50% of your take-home pay goes toward needs, such as groceries and mortgage or rent, 30% to wants and 20% to debt payments and savings.
It’s the 30% wants that we have the ability to cut back on quickly if we need to. A lot of that cutting back is happening because we don’t have a choice — commuting expenses and restaurant spending are going down naturally. Of course, other expenses are possibly going up as people are spending more on at-home activities for children and online exercise."
"March 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/spreading-the-message-without-spreading-the-virus/569194252/,StarTribune,"Amid an election-year pandemic, Minnesota candidates are making changes","Erika Cashin, a Republican candidate for Congress in southeastern Minnesota’s Second Congressional District, already misses the campaign trail.
“I probably had 500 cups of coffee with people in the last four months to talk about my race,” Cashin said. “That’s what I’m missing the most right now.”
Cashin is one of a handful of candidates seeking the GOP endorsement to run against U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, a Democrat in a swing district that could be one of the most competitive in the nation. The GOP endorsing convention is scheduled for May 2, but will most likely have to be conducted remotely, party officials say.
Craig also has had to make adjustments. She held a briefing with constituents last week to talk about the effect of coronavirus on schools in the district — by phone conference.
The disruption to public life brought about by the spread of COVID-19 has major implications for a critical election year in Minnesota. Candidates, operatives and activists in both the Minnesota DFL and GOP are racing to keep campaigns operating without access to the time-honored political art of pressing the flesh.
“It’s uncharted territory on every level,” said Jennifer Carnahan, chairwoman of the Republican Party of Minnesota. Her counterpart at the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party, Ken Martin, echoed that: “So much of what we take for granted about how an election works is up in the air right now.”
Political parties are being forced to hold the year’s crucial conventions by phone or online. The Trump campaign and others are holding virtual training sessions for volunteers around the state. Rallies have been canceled and office seekers at every level have suspended in-person appearances. A southern Minnesota candidate for Congress tweeted out a contact form for anyone who “needs someone to talk with (not just about politics but anything).”
Already, both parties have postponed regional and congressional district conventions, or are making plans to proceed via online or mail balloting. Still up in the air are state party conventions, which typically draw hundreds of activists from throughout the state; they are scheduled for May, but both Carnahan and Martin said those will probably have to be conducted remotely, too.
Absentee voting
Another big question is the voting itself. Minnesota U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar is working on legislation that would ensure Americans are still able to vote in November by expanding early in-person voting and no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail to all states.
Raising money, the mother’s milk of politics, also is affected, with expectations rising that the pandemic will bring about a global economic slowdown or worse. In-person soirees are a staple of campaign fundraising. Political parties and campaigns, as nonprofit entities, rely almost entirely on donations to pay staff and spread their messages.
“We’re already seeing a slowdown to our fundraising in the last two weeks,” Martin said.
Conventions in question
But the most immediate problem is picking candidates. In addition to endorsing candidates in contested intraparty races, the regional conventions are where both parties elect presidential delegates and alternates to the national party conventions. Whether those conventions — Democrats in Milwaukee in July and Republicans in Charlotte, N.C., in August — actually happen is an open question.
The DFL already decided its congressional district conventions will use online or mail balloting. Cheryl Poling, the DFL chairwoman in the Third Congressional District in the Twin Cities’ suburbs, said she’s heard zero complaints. “People are relieved they don’t have to worry about coming to this, quite frankly,” she said.
There’s no DFL endorsement fight in the Third, so the only task is electing presidential delegates and alternates. “The folks campaigning for those spots, they can make calls, they can send e-mails,” Poling said. “They can do pretty much everything but that same-day, in-person lobbying that you’d do at a traditional convention.”
Endorsement fights are likely to be trickier to pull off remotely, often requiring multiple rounds of balloting and big shifts in support that typically bubble up from conversations and deal-making on the convention floor.
Minnesota Republicans have two endorsement fights brewing at the congressional level: in the Second District, where six candidates including Cashin are vying for party support; and in the Seventh Congressional District in western Minnesota, with five Republicans fighting to take on U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson in November.
“I’ve advised my clients, turn on the phone, practice video,” said Gregg Peppin, a longtime political strategist who’s running several GOP campaigns this year, including Cashin’s. Matt Pagano, a Phoenix-based Republican strategist whose firm is working for Second District candidate Tyler Kistner, said to look for all kinds of remote technology to come to bear in campaigns.
“Tele-town halls are going to be a bigger thing. Mail communication is going to get much bigger. Digital outreach, texting voters directly is going to be big,” Pagano said.
Dan Feehan, a Democratic candidate for Congress in the First Congressional District, said he’s shifting his campaign’s focus away from overt politicking in favor of community service. He’s just one of many candidates in Minnesota to announce that approach in recent days.
“I have a platform to put out good public information,” Feehan said. On Monday, he tweeted out an online form for First District residents who “need someone to talk with.” He said anyone who signs up will get a call, e-mail or text from him or someone on his campaign staff.
“I was just gearing up this past weekend for 18 county conventions in the next couple weeks that now aren’t happening,” Feehan said. “So my energy is there, we’re just trying to find different forms to express it.”"
"March 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/for-gov-tim-walz-no-playbook-to-manage-covid-19/569193172/,StarTribune,"For Tim Walz and other governors, there's no playbook to managing COVID-19","Tim Walz was out of his element.
Minnesota’s extroverted first-term governor was stuck inside his Summit Avenue home with a PowerPoint presentation ready to go and a video camera pointed at his face.
The former schoolteacher and football coach isn’t really a teleprompter guy, so he was going without one. He’s not usually a PowerPoint guy either. But these slides, filled with charts and models, would help the DFLer deliver a message to Minnesotans he couldn’t have imagined a few years ago, when he was crisscrossing the state campaigning on a message of bridging urban and rural divides.
He didn’t want COVID-19 to be the thing that united them.
“Minnesotans, we’re in this together,” he said as he pleaded to thousands, via livestream video, to stay inside their homes to slow the spread of the coronavirus. No governor in modern Minnesota history had ever had to make such a sweeping emergency order.
But Walz and other governors across the country are now on the front lines of something unprecedented, with no playbook to follow and where every decision means life or death.
He has direct knowledge of the threat: The video message came on the third day of his own self-quarantine, coming after he found out a member of his security detail had the virus. “I’m asking you to buckle it up for a few more weeks,” he told Minnesotans from his own home confinement.
The age of social distancing has tapped into another side of Walz, the former command sergeant major who spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard responding to natural disasters and months deployed overseas, even if he never saw combat.
“He’s not sugarcoating stuff, but he’s not scaring people either,” said Charlie Weaver, executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership, who led the Department of Public Safety under former Gov. Jesse Ventura during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “You can’t underestimate the psychological impacts and the importance of leadership on the public in a time like this. His calm, thoughtful approach to this has been the perfect tonic to the fear that people naturally have.”
Sprinkling terms like “plan of attack” and “battle ready” into daily briefings on the coronavirus, Walz has used sweeping executive power afforded to governors in times of crisis to shut down bars, restaurants and schools, halt sports franchises and postpone elective surgeries. He’s enacted paid leave for state employees and increased penalties for price gouging for the duration of the state of emergency. Now as governor, he’s the commander in chief of Minnesota’s National Guard, and he’s deployed them to help with the response to COVID-19.
“I do really feel like he’s the governor made for this moment,” said Steve Grove, Walz’s commissioner of employment and economic development, who has been in the room as they prepare the state’s response.
It’s thrust Walz into the limelight in a whole new way. His office’s phone lines have exploded and he’s trended nationally on Twitter. Protests have popped up outside of his residence. Minnesotans have started timing emergency grocery and liquor runs around his daily 2 p.m. coronavirus briefing, knowing that at any moment he could transform their lives even more.
Even his political foes in the Legislature are careful to mute their public criticism of the governor because they don’t want to undermine his response to the virus.
“I root for him, frankly, to be successful for Minnesota,” said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake. “I do encourage him to weigh the risk of the virus, which is great, with the consequences of causing people to be out of work and lose their jobs. What is the price of that long-term as well? That’s a difficult balancing act.”
Behind the scenes, his commissioners and confidants say he seeks counsel daily from academics, business leaders, hospitals and governors in other states. He’s also turned to former Minnesota governors Mark Dayton and Tim Pawlenty. He absorbs huge amounts of information and acts quickly, they said, even if he’s ahead of where public sentiment is.
“Governors need to make the right decisions in a crisis, but they also need to make them at the right time,” said Pawlenty, a Republican who served two terms as governor. “Making a key decision a bit early in a crisis is almost always better than making it a bit late.”
Even with sweeping actions, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state had hit 441, with 30 still hospitalized as of Saturday. Both numbers are expected to grow.
In his breathless speaking style, Walz rattles off rafts of statistics in his daily briefings. One of those numbers — 235 — were the total number of intensive care beds open in the state on March 22. Walz is trying to make sure they’re not all filled at once while the state tries to increase capacity.
But with new information pouring in every minute, things haven’t always gone smoothly. He’s had to clarify an executive order shutting down businesses with a new executive order shuttering even more businesses. Forty-eight hours after saying schools should stay open, he called a sudden news conference to order them closed, acknowledging that new data he received reversed his message to the public.
House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, said Walz’s willingness to admit mistakes helps create an aura of transparency around the governor at a time when many legislative functions have been forced out of public view by social distancing.
“A good leader is willing to be wrong and admit it,” he said. “There’s a level of candor and honesty about the shortcomings about what they are doing that makes people feel like they trust him.”
When it has come to big decisions, like shutting down bars and restaurants, those who are closest to Walz say they have weighed heavily on him.
“There are moments when you see him come to that conclusion, look out at the team and articulate that decision and take a breath to reflect on the magnitude of it,” said Chris Schmitter, Walz’s chief of staff, who has been with him since his days in Congress. “Then move quickly into: ‘OK what are the steps we need to take to execute it.’ ”
The decisions have taken a personal toll. The former teacher closed down classrooms, which are now implementing distance learning plans. More than 20% of the state’s workforce is unemployed at his direct order. He’s relied heavily on child care providers to stay open to provide care for the children of doctors and emergency responders at a time when they were already struggling to stay afloat.
The messages he delivered on the campaign trail — to pump funding into schools and improve economic security for Minnesotans — are now most directly hit by his own orders to curtail the pandemic.
“There is a lot of emotion in the room because the consequences are so clear to everything that he hopes to achieve,” said Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm. “He and [Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan] are so keenly aware that the economic disruptions that these orders are creating hit the people who already have the most fragile lives.”"
"March 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mackay-worry-is-a-destructive-habit-in-life-business/569165792/,StarTribune,"Worry is a destructive habit in life, business","There is an old saying: “Worrying won’t stop the bad stuff from happening; it just stops you from enjoying the good.”
Such wisdom! It is advice I take to heart and try to remember when I am facing a situation like we are going through today with the coronavirus pandemic.
Worry is the most destructive habit. I am as bad about worrying as anyone. I always think about what can go wrong with any project. Over the years, I have learned that worrying does not give you anything but wrinkles; something else to worry about.
Worry does not do any good. I know; most of the things I worried about didn’t happen.
Worry is wasting today’s time to clutter up tomorrow’s opportunities with yesterday’s troubles.
Dr. Charles Mayo, one of the co-founders of the Mayo Clinic, said: “Worry affects circulation, the heart and the glands, the whole nervous system, and profoundly affects the heart. I have never known a man who died from overwork, but many who died from doubt.”
In my most recent book, “You Haven’t Hit Your Peak Yet!” I wrote a chapter on “The Second Ten Commandments.” The first of these new commandments reads: “Thou shall not worry, for worry is the most unproductive of all human activities. You can’t saw sawdust. A day of worry is more exhausting than a day of work. People get so busy worrying about yesterday or tomorrow, they forget about today. And today is what you have to work with.”
Dale Carnegie’s “How to Stop Worrying and Start Living” has been one of my favorite books for the last 50 years. It was first published in 1948, but the advice it contains is just as fresh and valuable as it was then and is right-on for these uncertain times.
Two sections that really knocked my socks off were about businesspeople trying to solve problems without the added burden of worrying. Carnegie credits Willis H. Carrier (whose name appears on many of our air conditioners) with these silver bullets:
1. Analyze the situation honestly and figure out what is the worst possible thing that could happen.
2. Prepare yourself mentally to accept the worst, if necessary.
3. Then calmly try to improve upon the worst, which you have already agreed mentally to accept.
Also from Carnegie’s book, this particular list describes how to “Break the Worry Habit Before It Breaks You”:
• Keep busy.
• Don’t fuss about trifles.
• Cooperate with the inevitable.
• Decide just how much anxiety a thing may be worth and refuse to give it more.
• Don’t worry about the past.
I love this story of a little clock that almost worried itself to death. It worked itself into a frazzle thinking about how often it would have to tick in the coming year.
“I will have to tick two times per second, which means 120 times a minute, 7,200 times every hour and 172,800 every day!” Then it went further — 1,209,600 every week, and a whopping 63 million times, give or take, over the next 12 months! The more it thought about that number, the more worried it became. Finally, anxiety overtook the little clock and it stopped ticking.
And it was miserable. So it consulted a psychiatrist. “I just don’t have what it takes to tick that often,” it complained.
The doctor asked, “How many ticks must you tick at one time?” The clock replied, “Just one.” The doctor suggested, “How about using your energy to just tick one tick at a time, and I think you’ll be just fine.”
So the little clock wound itself up, decided to take one tick at a time and ticked happily ever after."
"March 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/governing-in-the-era-of-coronavirus-tests-openness/569165092/,StarTribune,Era of coronavirus tests openness in Minnesota Legislature,"The leaders of both parties stood together — yet 6 feet apart — to announce the unprecedented step of recessing the Minnesota Legislature in the middle of the session to limit the spread of coronavirus.
The only problem: They still needed to respond to the pandemic.
Variations on that scene at the State Capitol two weeks ago have played out in government bodies across the nation as state assemblies, city councils and Congress restrict access to their offices to protect lawmakers and the public from the further spread of COVID-19 — even as they’re called to take decisive actions to respond. The era of social distancing has forced once open discussions into private conference calls and Zoom meetings, where decisions are made about sweeping policies and millions of taxpayer dollars, all without public input.
Some see the disruption as a stress test for liberal democracy’s principles of openness and transparency.
In a time of crisis, “transparency is often the first thing to go,” said Matt Ehling,executive director of Public Record Media, which advocates for transparency in state policies. “There is certainly an imperative for the government to act to secure public safety in these times, but the government has constitutional mandates that are placed upon it that don’t go away in a time of emergency.”
Congress, which is closed down to the public, negotiated a $2.2 trillion stimulus package mostly in private among a handful of top party leaders. On March 13, three days before Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared an emergency, City Council members received a briefing on the city’s coronavirus preparation efforts. The council initially closed the meeting to the public but reversed that decision after the Star Tribune objected.
In St. Paul, state legislators approved a $330 million COVID-19 response bill on Thursday that was negotiated in private meetings with Gov. Tim Walz’s administration. The legislation was posted online to the public 10 minutes before members of the House were set to convene and vote on the package.
Even as lawmakers were voting on the bill, many didn’t know what was in it. Sen. Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, had questions about the use of $20 million from a fund meant for public infrastructure to support large mining projects on the Iron Range for a coronavirus response.
“If we’re going to be asked to help with money designated to the Iron Range, is this money a grant or will this be paid back to us?” he asked Republicans in the majority.
Sen. Eric Pratt, R-Prior Lake, who helped oversee that section of the bill, responded that he “did not see this language until this morning” but agreed the question needed to be addressed. “As soon as we can be closer than six feet together, I’m happy to talk about it,” he said.
For Ehling, the legislative scramble was reminiscent of post-9/11 policymaking. Most members of Congress hadn’t read much of the Patriot Act before they were asked to vote on it. Many of those provisions are still in place today. “This is a key example of why it is important to challenge assertions of government power made during an emergency, since they are difficult to claw back at a later time,” he said.
Policymakers at every level are keenly aware of open meeting laws, and in some cases, how to avoid triggering them.
In Minneapolis, while the city’s public health emergency is in place, Mayor Jacob Frey dials into a Skype call three times a week with an advisory group that includes the heads of various departments, City Council President Lisa Bender and Vice President Andrea Jenkins. The elected officials don’t make up a quorum of the group, so the city says it isn’t required to open the meetings to the public.
The Minnesota Legislature is not bound by the same open meeting laws as local government entities. But in 1990, legislators passed their own law that requires all meetings be open to the public, including House and Senate floor sessions and committee meetings, when a quorum of members is present.
While a city council member or mayor can be sued for violating the open meeting law, the Legislature’s language doesn’t have such an enforcement mechanism. Even so, state lawmakers have been careful in recent weeks to limit their meetings to avoid a quorum. Instead, they have divided discussions between parties into small virtual “working groups” that have discussed topics from child care assistance and changing tax deadlines to forgiving driver’s license renewal dates.
The calls have not been open to the press or public. A Star Tribune reporter was denied access to the meetings and any recordings of deliberations, which a House DFL spokesman said did not exist.
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said it’s been a steep learning curve for legislators to adapt and embrace all-new technology to hold meetings. “Even within our caucus, I didn’t always communicate the way I wanted to because we’re trying to learn new systems. Add to that, we’re trying to be transparent to the public and it just made it extremely difficult,” he said.
The grinding of the machinery of government was on full display Thursday when state lawmakers reconvened to pass the $330 million emergency aid package. They spaced themselves on the floor, with some moving up into the public viewing gallery to allow for social distancing. Some lawmakers didn’t show up at all and cast their ballots remotely, the first time that’s ever been done. The House and Senate chambers were roped off to keep members of the media and public from getting near the floor. Legislators who showed up were armed with disinfectant wipes and traded squirts of hand sanitizer.
House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said there were good reasons for caution. Legislators represent every community across the state and converge on the Capitol to cast votes before dispersing again to their districts. At least one Minnesota House staffer has already tested positive for COVID-19, and two legislators, Sen. Paul Anderson, R-Plymouth, and Rep. Jon Koznick, R-Lakeville, are in self-quarantine after coming in contact with people who have the virus.
“We are a gigantic petri dish,” Hortman said. “You take 201 legislators who have had contact with other humans and put them all in the same building. You better have a darn good reason to bring that viral load into the building all at the same time.”
Before gaveling out the one-day session, the House voted in favor of allowing remote committee hearings that require an opportunity for public testimony. The Senate did not."
"March 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-needs-to-keep-listening-to-experts-on-covid-19/569227342/,StarTribune,Trump's time frame on COVID-19 social distancing turns more realistic,"President Donald Trump has sent mixed signals about COVID-19’s risks and how long Americans will need to stay at home to contain this new disease. But on Sunday he took a sensible new stance, extending strict social-distancing guidelines at least through April 30.
That’s 18 days beyond Easter, when Trump had hoped to see pews packed at churches to celebrate the Christian holy day. The extended guidelines appear to heed the concerns of Trump’s respected medical advisers and reflect a grim reality.
This is a new virus for which there are no proven treatments and no vaccine. The nation also appears to be on the front end of the contagion. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, publicly estimated Sunday that 100,000 to 200,000 people in the U.S. could die of COVID-19, even with aggressive mitigation measures.
Still, dangerous COVID-19 denialism abounds. Some of it is fueled by amateur number-crunching about current confirmed cases and death rates. These lowball calculations have several major problems. Among them are the lack of testing and the fact that this is the early stage of the contagion in this country. Today’s numbers aren’t tomorrow’s numbers, and medical experts have a lot to learn about the behavior of this new coronavirus. How it acts in one location is no guarantee it will act the same in another.
Trump’s inconsistent statements about COVID-19 have also not been helpful in getting people to take this public health threat seriously. He downplayed the disease’s spread earlier this year, and since then his statements have varied week to week.
The presidential social-distancing guidelines, which were announced March 16, were helpful. They include avoiding nonessential travel and eating out, as well as avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people. But last week’s open-by-Easter announcement suggested wrongly that the epidemic would be under control by the holiday.
The month ahead is critical in containing the virus, and everyone needs to help by staying home to break the chain of infection. Trump should keep pounding on the presidential bully pulpit. Given the bitter political divisions in this country, some will need to hear the message directly from him.
Sadly, it’s not difficult to find examples of those still not taking COVID-19 seriously. Spring-break revelers from across the country jammed Florida beaches this month. There’s video of a church in that same state still gathering worshipers together. With COVID-19 symptoms appearing from two to 14 days from exposure, we are just beginning to learn what role this recklessness is playing in the disease’s spread.
But a cluster of cases in Mount Vernon, Wa., previews the price for underestimating risk. Members of the Skagit Valley Chorale group decided to go ahead with practice at a local church on March 10. While Seattle was a hot zone about an hour’s drive south, Skagit County, known for its tulip farms, hadn’t yet had any confirmed cases.
Sixty members came and sang for two and a half hours. “Nearly three weeks later, 45 have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or ill with the symptoms, at least three have been hospitalized, and two are dead,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz’s stay-at-home order went into effect Friday and continues through 5 p.m. April 10. Trump’s welcome new guidance underscores the prudence of the state’s move and signals the need to move with caution in the weeks after to contain this viral threat."
"March 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/more-thoughtful-lockdown-rules-could-spare-us-loss-and-suffering/569234072/,StarTribune,More thoughtful lockdown rules could spare us loss and suffering,"We are grateful for all your hard work these last few weeks. You have been laboring without rest doing what you believe it takes to keep Minnesotans safe. You have been making difficult decisions that touch the lives of millions.
The answers to the crisis are complicated, with repercussions in every aspect of Minnesotans’ lives.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has stated: “No American is going to say, ‘Accelerate the economy at the cost of human life.’ Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.”
We agree.
However, some of the tools employed fighting COVID-19 are creating needless harm to our citizens’ mental and financial well-being, while providing no benefit in the fight. And they are also putting the over 100,000 Minnesotans with a disability at great risk when next year’s budget shows billions in shortfalls.
Caring for them is very expensive, and since the human-services budget is over 50% of Minnesota’s all-funds spending, the “fix” will land on their shoulders.
Service providers are already closing, clients will be poorly cared for and some may die.
That doesn’t have to happen, if we act wisely now.
In his treatise “Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance,” technology entrepreneur Tomas Pueyo clearly favors suppression strategies such as sheltering in place. However, and much less noticed, he also warns to consider the economic and social cost, and to pick the ones that get the biggest reduction in transmission for the lowest cost.
We agree.
We also agree with renowned Minnesota epidemiologist Mike Osterholm: “And I’m tired of hearing people say, ‘We’ll do everything even if we overreact.’ ”
It is for this reason that we write you today. Minnesotans are concerned. With the Stay At Home executive order, “essential” services are allowed to continue while “nonessential” ones are not.
Winners and losers are unnecessarily and arbitrarily being determined.
Many families will be unable to pay their bills, their property taxes, or their mortgages. Many will unnecessarily be forced into bankruptcy and become dependent on the state, in a time when we will be devoid of resources. Some may feel so much despair they attempt suicide. And it will all have been preventable.
A small insurance company in Anoka is open, since it provides financial services. Next to it, a hair salon with a single chair is shuttered by executive order. The insurance agency will be able to pay its rent and property tax on a home. The hair stylist with the salon may never open again.
Superstores like Walmart are open, sites teeming with transmission opportunities. However, the Anoka Greenhaven golf course is closed by executive order. It can operate virtually, with the golf twosome interacting with no staff. These two can go for a walk in the park. But they cannot share a 130-acre golf course with 70 other golfers even while the golf course can assure social distancing.
Cabinet makers are closed by executive order. There is a company with three men who are the only workers in a huge warehouse. They cannot work.
These are not “hard choices.” These are unnecessary losses. In each instance, no measurable epidemiological benefit is attained. However, massive economic and emotional distress is created.
This is not the Minnesota way. Minnesotans don’t want loans or handouts. They want to work. And they want to protect the most vulnerable among us.
We offer a solution. A Minnesota Solution:
• Encourage people to stay home. They already are. The message to socially distance has taken root. It is working. Transmission rates are already far below what they would have been. We have “flattened the curve.” We are safer.
• So now, let us define “safe” vs. “unsafe” sites instead of “essential” vs. “nonessential” functions. If a site is generally safe, let it remain open or reopen. Let the solo hair stylist remain in his or her hair salon. Let the golfers golf. Let the cabinet builders build.
• Give our families and businesses the chance to safely work and be strong for after this crisis. Allow them to feed their families.
• The state can offer guidance and safe operation policies to keep Minnesotans moving forward. It can help guide “unsafe” industries in what they will need to do, and they will gladly comply.
• This will cause no impact on the fight against COVID-19, but it will greatly aid in the financial recovery, and it will markedly improve many people’s mental health.
• Minnesota can lead the country again. We can provide a national model for fighting COVID-19 and freeing the economy, simultaneously."

Futures in London fell as much as 9.4% to the lowest since November 2002, while New York crude briefly dipped below $20 a barrel. The huge oversupply is further collapsing the oil market's structure, and there may be more weakness to come as the world quickly runs out of storage capacity. The slump in demand has shut refineries from South Africa to Canada.
Prices are on track for the worst quarter on record. Goldman Sachs estimates consumption will drop by 26 million barrels a day this week as measures to contain the coronavirus hurt global GDP.
Meanwhile, Riyadh and Moscow are showing no signs of a detente in their supply battle as Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase its oil exports in the coming months.
""Market participants and oil producers are now shaken to the bone over what is playing out in the oil market,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB. ""The world cannot store the current surplus.""
In the market for actual barrels of crude, prices are already far below those of futures benchmarks. Oil from Canada now costs little more than $5 a barrel, while traders were bidding for some barrels in negative territory on Friday.
It's a similar picture in Europe, where Kazakh crude was offered at a 10-year low. As a result, the six-month contango on the global Brent benchmark has grown bigger than in the financial crisis, at more than $13 a barrel.
The plunge in prices has caused distress in some OPEC nations. Algeria, which holds the cartel's rotating presidency, urged the secretariat to convene a panel but the call has failed to gather the majority backing necessary to go ahead.
Riyadh is among those opposing the idea."
"March 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/u-mayo-ready-covid-19-antibody-tests-in-minnesota/569233992/,StarTribune,"University of Minnesota, Mayo Clinic ready COVID-19 antibody tests in Minnesota","The University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic are close to unveiling antibody tests that can determine if people have already been infected by the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and are no longer threats to get or spread the infection.
State health officials see these tests as a key part of Minnesota’s pandemic response, because they could define the breadth of the outbreak and maybe identify previously infected individuals who could move about in public freely and volunteer in response efforts.
Identifying people with immunity to the virus “gives us the ability [to know] who wouldn’t need to be quarantined, who could be out and not infecting others,” Gov. Tim Walz said on Monday.
Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to infections and can be found through tests of blood serum — the clear liquid that separates out when blood clots. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the current pandemic, antibodies don’t show up in sufficient quantities for eight to 11 days.
That makes antibody testing ineffective for the purpose of early diagnosis, but a potentially powerful tool for identifying anyone who was infected, whether they had symptoms or not. “In theory, you probably want to test everybody in the country,” said Marc Jenkins, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Immunology.
Testing could be particularly important for health care workers, whose infection risks could be heightened if they run out of protective masks and face shields when working with any surge of COVID-19 patients. If they’ve already been infected, those workers could have immunity — although there is only limited evidence so far that people cannot be reinfected by this coronavirus.
Jenkins’ team used a common chemical assay test, known as ELISA, and found that it correctly distinguished samples from two people with COVID-19 from two reference samples taken from people before the pandemic.
Researchers nationwide are racing to develop antibody tests, which under current emergency pandemic conditions would not need the usual level of review and approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Exactly how much verification of tests is needed is unclear, but Jenkins said he wants to at least get successful results for 10 positive and 10 negative specimens before even considering the test for public use. He expected to have that many results in the next couple of weeks.
“It’s going to take a lot more samples … to validate the test,” he said, “but we have a pipeline to do it and the results from these early tests were so clean that I’m pretty hopeful.”
Mayo has used more than 300 samples to evaluate the accuracy of three different assay tests, and has found one ELISA-based test to be most accurate, said Elitza Theel, director of Mayo’s Infectious Diseases Serology lab.
Theel said it will be critical for doctors to understand that the current molecular tests are still the best for diagnosing symptomatic patients — and that new antibody tests won’t solve any national shortage of those. However, from a disease-detective standpoint, health officials will be able to use antibody tests to determine when a community has achieved “herd immunity” — which means that enough people have already been infected that the risk of new infections starts to diminish.
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus that emerged earlier this winter in Wuhan, China, and spread globally. Initial reports indicated a death rate of anywhere from 1% to 3.4%, but an abundance of antibody testing would provide a more accurate picture because it would allow for testing of both sick and healthy people to find out how many of them have been infected.
“When you have an actual true denominator, you’re able to determine the true case fatality rate,” Theel said.
Local studies on antibody testing didn’t occur until recently, because researchers needed substantial samples from COVID-19 patients to do it, and because there was a more immediate need to develop diagnostic molecular tests for the illness.
Quality problems with a molecular test created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially delayed states such as Minnesota from using it. Then, supply shortages prevented its broader use, even as the coronavirus was spreading nationwide.
Mayo and other private labs created their own versions of the molecular tests, and now have conducted more such tests than the state’s public health lab, which has prioritized its limited supplies for hospitalized patients, long-term care facility residents and health care workers.
Jenkins said he first started looking at antibody tests when news of testing supply shortages emerged. Knowing that antibody testing could provide invaluable public information, he said he wanted to create a pipeline for these tests on which Minnesota could rely.
Jenkins acquired a COVID-19 protein that is critical to the test from Fang Li, the U researcher whose recent Nature journal article explored the genetic origins of this coronavirus and its evolved mechanism for infecting cells.
Other coronaviruses cause the common cold and also were responsible for global SARS and MERS outbreaks. Jenkins said he will be checking to make sure the newly developed test identifies only cases of COVID-19 infections.
Whether antibody testing could be used as an all-clear system for people is based on a key assumption: that people develop at least short-term immunity to the coronavirus.
One small study in China found no reinfections in monkeys when they were exposed to the virus a second time. Researchers also believe that people develop immunity to other coronaviruses that lasts months or maybe years. Antibodies were found in patients six years after the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic.
Jenkins said it appears likely there is at least temporary immunity, but it’s unclear whether people will get lifetime immunity after only one infection from this virus — as is the case with polio and chickenpox. On the other hand, people only develop immunity one at a time to the many different types of rhinoviruses, which cause common colds, he said.
As many as 80% of people infected by this coronavirus suffer mild or no symptoms. A reliable test could be a relief to many people if they knew they now had immunity, Jenkins said. “Just for the psychological well-being of a lot of people, this could have real value.”"
"March 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/five-ways-the-federal-government-can-help-health-care-professionals-get-critical-gear/569253782/,StarTribune,Five ways the federal government can help health care professionals get critical gear,"The coronavirus pandemic is a generational event. Much as our firefighters, paramedics and police officers ran toward the flames on 9/11 while crowds ran away from the twin towers, today our nurses, doctors and first responders are running toward the crisis. As most Americans shelter at home, our health care workers are on the front lines — and too many are heading into battle without proper gear.
Every phone line and social media feed in my district has been flooded with nurses and doctors reporting that they are reusing equipment or are simply out of masks, gloves, gowns and equipment to test for coronavirus. They are confused and worried. We all should be. Without protective gear, they are risking their lives to save others.
I have spent much of the past two weeks trying to understand how to get more personal protective equipment (often called PPE) into Michigan — a portion of which I represent in Congress — from the federal government. The supply situation is incredibly messy. The coronavirus is an unprecedented public health crisis, one that would stretch any administration, but crises are not new for anyone who has worked in national security. During my 14 years at the CIA and later at the Pentagon, I participated in and led dozens of crisis task forces on topics as varied as confronting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to responding to the Islamic State’s takeover of parts of Iraq and Syria. My experiences have taught me that there are important things the executive branch can do, now, to improve situations across the country:
The first and most urgent task is to cut through the chaos by naming a single federal emergency medical supply czar with the authority to coordinate this herculean task. Officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services are engaging manufacturers nationwide that are retooling to make vital equipment, but missing in all the efforts is a designated leader to spearhead a unified plan of action. Dealing with a single coordinator who has the president’s trust and a free hand to wrangle multiple federal entities into a coherent plan would relieve a lot of worried minds in state capitals and hospital wards. Naming a supply czar would make other necessary steps more easily achievable.
Second, the administration should centralize FEMA procurement of medical supplies. Michigan and other states have been scouring the globe for supplies and competing with one another — at the president’s urging. Many members of Congress have attempted to become fly-by-night matchmakers, trying desperately to find companies or even individuals who can deliver trusted supplies to our states. This is not the way to run a supply chain, much less efforts to save American lives in a public health crisis. FEMA needs to centralize supply and make it possible to obtain equipment in strategic and cost-effective ways.
Next, the administration must consistently use the Defense Production Act to organize the retooling of manufacturers in Michigan and elsewhere. I introduced bipartisan legislation in the House last week to force the administration to use the act. The president took some good steps in invoking authorities in recent days. But the federal government needs to use the act where it will be most helpful: to give companies the specific types and quantities of supplies required; to place large, bulk orders in advance; and to guarantee those orders. Big and medium-size manufacturers and suppliers can justify the significant expense of producing essential supplies if they have specific guidance, backed up by orders, and those orders are given the Defense Department’s high-priority rating. In addition, the president should stop attacking the very companies that are retooling to help in this crisis. Such criticism certainly won’t encourage other firms to step forward.
We also need a coordinated approach to transportation and logistics to carry out a strategic plan for supplies. Commercial aircraft that are idle and, if necessary, the military’s fleet should help speed supplies to where they are needed. Military planes are airlifting PPE purchases to the United States, a good first step — but far more must be done.
Last, the administration should order a comprehensive review of all Food and Drug Administration restrictions on what gear health care professionals can use and, whenever safely possible, try to ease them. For example, gloves, masks and other protective gear used in other industries and in other nations could help keep our health care providers safe, but some equipment doesn’t meet existing federal restrictions. Rapid FDA action is needed to accelerate the flow of this critical protective gear.
Americans rightfully feel ashamed when we see our front-line troops are going into battle without the proper equipment. The tearful medical professionals I have spoken to need hope today that help is coming tomorrow. In this moment of national crisis, we need a leader with an action plan."
"March 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/2-residents-of-rural-martin-county-die-of-covid-19/569239942/,StarTribune,Southern Minnesota county becomes unlikely coronavirus hotbed,"FAIRMONT, MINN. – Eugene Borchardt hadn’t traveled anywhere exotic in the last weeks of his life. The healthy 88-year-old waved to neighbors while taking his daily walks outside or in the local mall. He drank coffee with friends at restaurants in town. He went to the grocery store and to church and honored fellow military veterans at funerals, as he always had.
His family isn’t sure exactly where he picked up the insidious novel coronavirus in a farming county of fewer than 20,000 residents.
Friday, on the eighth day of his hospitalization, Borchardt became Martin County’s second COVID-19 fatality, underscoring the harsh reality that the global pandemic can quickly infiltrate and spread even in remote communities that often feel insulated from such worldly threats.
As of Monday, according to state health reports, two county residents had died from the virus out of 23 who had tested positive — including nine from a local church congregation, according to the pastor — making the small county an unexpected hotbed for the illness.
“It’s probably a good assumption that it’s been here for a while,” said Chera Sevcik, community health administrator for Martin and Fari­bault counties. “I think people are scared. People are looking for an understanding of why our numbers are much higher than everybody else’s in rural Minnesota.”
State health officials haven’t been able to determine how the virus entered this county on the Iowa border, where the Fairmont water tower sticks out on the prairie horizon. The first people with symptoms in the county in mid-March hadn’t traveled and were classified as community transmission cases, according to the state Department of Health.
Official case numbers may be higher there because the local hospital is part of the Mayo Clinic system, which has its own testing capabilities. But the numbers stand out in contrast to other rural counties in Minnesota and surrounding states, leaving no doubt among residents that the virus is in their midst.
County and city leaders are doing their best to release all the information they can on each case, Sevcik said, while sending a united message urging people to stay calm and stay home to slow the community spread.
Feeling overwhelmed
That spread is what has people here on edge.
“My neighbor messaged me yesterday, freaking out,” said Eva Wagner, who works at a local farm supply store.
While the governor’s stay-at-home order kicked in over the weekend, people are still allowed to go to essential businesses, including the store where Wagner works.
Clerks there said they have been as busy as ever. Some customers aren’t good at social distancing, they said, while others come in with masks and even gloves. The store is constantly disinfecting surfaces, she said.
“Martin County is not that big of a county,” Wagner said. “You don’t know if those [infected] people have been around. We don’t know if those people have been in our store.”
Several miles away in Northrop, a town of about 200, the pastor at St. James Lutheran Church said he believes nine members of his parish, which includes a church in a rural township, had tested positive for the virus.
“I kind of have spent a little time racking my brain to what degree it came through the church,” the Rev. John Henry said. But the positive cases have surfaced in both churches and include some people who had gone away on vacations, he said.
Besides holding Sunday services online now, he is focusing on ministering to congregants who are struggling in various ways.
“One of the words that just pops up everywhere ... is this word ‘overwhelmed,’ ” Henry said.
People worry about the local hospitals being overwhelmed. People feel overwhelmed with the isolation. One mom who tested positive hasn’t been able to hug her children for two weeks, he said, and adults who can’t see their parents in nursing homes are distraught. Others who tested positive feel stigmatized.
“It’s really tough,” he said, adding that in some cases, “it might be worse than the actual symptoms itself.”
Congregation members Larry and Annette Bremer can attest to that.
The couple never suspected they would get infected with this new coronavirus. On the evening of March 11, after Annette attended a Lenten service, she went home and curled up into her recliner, telling her husband that all of a sudden she felt like she had been “hit by a bus.”
She lay low for the next three days until Larry took her to the emergency room, where she tested negative for the flu. Late the next evening, they learned she tested positive for COVID-19.
She was so shocked, she said, that “you could have knocked me over with a feather.” With an underlying condition that often makes her cough and feel short of breath, early symptoms didn’t raise concerns, she said. Plus, news of the virus wasn’t at the forefront of everyone’s minds at that point — certainly not in their small community.
Larry quickly got tested, too, though he had no symptoms except remembering mild fatigue and lightheadedness two or three weeks earlier that he had chalked up to stress and tried to cure with extra cups of coffee.
Health officials never put Larry on an isolation list, he said, because he recovered from the illness before anyone knew he had it.
The couple isn’t sure where they got it. Their daughter had traveled to China in January, but they said neither she nor anyone around her has had symptoms. They believe Larry, a crop insurance agent, somehow picked it up in the local community, they said.
In recent days, Larry went to his office, a convenience store and a grocery store in town, he said. He was told he was not contagious and was likely immune from catching it again.
He learned that people called the sheriff to report that he was out and about.
“It’s kind of like you’re the leper, needing to yell ‘I’m clean!’ ” Larry said, smiling.
But the couple said they understand people’s apprehension. They want their neighbors to know the facts and stay calm, they said, because the majority of people who get the virus will be OK.
“It’s important just to stay away from each other. Stay home. Don’t react to everything that you’re hearing,” Annette said. “People have been freaking out and getting all worked up.”
Annette has a letter from the state Department of Health, dated March 26, giving her the go-ahead to “return to school, work, travel and all usual activities.” She plans to return to her job as a social worker soon.
Now, Annette said, she and Larry are “probably the safest people to be around.”
Larry said he is willing to help researchers with antibodies if he can and is looking for a way to volunteer in areas where others might not feel safe.
A family’s nightmare
That volunteer spirit was something Eugene Borchardt held dear, friends and family said.
Eugene was always positive and led by example, family and friends said. A proud and patriotic Korean War veteran, he was always ready to lend a helping hand.
“He would do anything that anybody asked of him if feasibly possible,” Fairmont Mayor Debbie Foster said. “He was just a really good guy. He made a difference in people’s lives.”
Doug Borchardt said he took his father to the doctor on March 19. Eugene was shaking, extremely short of breath and his throat was full of phlegm. Staff at Mayo Clinic Health System in Fairmont put him on oxygen and quickly sent him by ambulance to a Mayo system hospital in Mankato.
“That’s the last we saw of him,” Doug Borchardt said. “It’s been a nightmare.”
Eugene was the rock of the family, gathering with his sons once a month for a boys’ night out and sending weekly e-mails with his musings, entitled “Sunday afternoon with Gene.”
It crushed his family that they couldn’t visit him in the hospital. After a test came back positive for COVID-19, those who had been in contact with him were told to quarantine themselves for two weeks.
While the family had to make decisions remotely about Eugene’s care, they praised Mayo hospital staff for showing incredible compassion.
Friday, through a conference call, the family decided it was time to let him go, Doug Borchardt said.
There were still no funeral plans Monday; quarantined family members still couldn’t go to view his body.
While community members have reached out from a distance to send their condolences and share memories of the man who many considered a community pillar, the virus has robbed Borchardt’s family of grieving together, too.
“We can’t support each other and hug each other,” Doug Borchardt said.
“Later on, when this all blows over, we’ll have a great send-off for him.”
He and other family members said they hope everyone in the county is following social distancing guidelines and staying home and not making a political issue of it, he said.
“I just hope people are taking it seriously,” he said. “It’s nothing to laugh at.”"
"March 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/how-to-maintain-democracy-despite-the-pandemic/569264202/,StarTribune,How to maintain democracy despite the pandemic,"The United States is facing a double-barreled health and economic crisis unlike anything it has seen since a brutal flu pandemic a century ago when the world was a different, less connected place.
The stresses and strains on all aspects of society are intense and only likely to build in coming weeks. But this emergency, while dire, cannot be allowed to interfere with the basics of U.S. democracy. They must be shored up even as so much else is upended.
For starters, the 12 states that have postponed presidential primaries because of the coronavirus threat must not cancel those primaries. To lessen public health risks, all states should make it easy to vote by mail and establish drive-through ballot drop-off sites for use in the final weeks before rescheduled primaries. This will be a test run for the Nov. 3 general election, which must go on as scheduled. There is time to implement changes on a large scale so voters don’t line up so close to one another.
A second crucial step is that the Democratic presidential primary campaign resume — safely, without rallies. It is unfortunate that Democratic front-runner Joe Biden recently said, “We’ve had enough debates,” and may skip the planned but not yet scheduled 12th and final debate run by the Democratic National Committee.
Biden’s lead over the other remaining Democratic candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is massive but not mathematically insurmountable. Biden refusing to participate in a safe, televised debate with no audience and candidates in separate studios would set a bad precedent. It would also be seen as an insult to millions of Sanders’ supporters, whose backing is critical to Democratic hopes to unseat Trump.
A third crucial step is canceling the Democratic National Convention scheduled for Milwaukee in July and the Republican National Convention scheduled for Charlotte, N.C., in August. Online conventions should be held instead. Holding such large gatherings seems likely to be a substantial public health risk for many months to come.
A fourth crucial step is allowing members of Congress to vote remotely. During a public health crisis like this, having every federal lawmaker congregate in a handful of buildings in one city makes no sense — especially because nearly 200 senators and representatives are older than 65, a particularly vulnerable group. Not only would remote voting keep lawmakers safe, it would also ensure that Congress — and, thus, American democracy — could function when it absolutely had to in a worst-case scenario."
"March 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-fairview-trims-work-hours-due-to-covid-19-impact/569255912/,StarTribune,COVID-19 plans weaken Minnesota hospitals' revenue,"Minnesota health systems are feeling financial pain from the shutdown in elective health care procedures, with revenue cuts prompting unpaid leaves and reduced hours for workers not directly involved with the response to COVID-19.
M Health Fairview, which is one of the state’s largest health care providers, said Tuesday it expects to reduce some staff work hours beginning Monday. The Mayo Clinic is reducing or temporarily suspending hours or projects for supplemental or contract workers. Duluth-based Essentia Health has placed 500 nonmedical employees on unpaid leave.
Hospitals supported an order in March from Gov. Tim Walz to indefinitely postponed all elective surgeries and procedures in Minnesota to conserve resources for COVID-19 patients, but it’s causing revenue hits in the near-term.
“This is an important substory behind the COVID-19 crisis,” said Dr. Rahul Koranne, president of the Minnesota Hospital Association.
“The first story, and the most important story, is that these health care systems are caregivers, and so the focus is to prepare,” Koranne said. But he added: “Some of our health care systems are calling it a significant bleeding that’s happening right now.”
Minneapolis-based M Health Fairview says it will provide affected employees a minimum of 50% pay and continuing benefits. The changes don’t apply to unionized workers, nor do they impact staff caring for patients sickened by the widening coronavirus pandemic.
It’s not yet clear how many will see reduced hours, but reductions are expected starting Monday through May 3. Employees could be called back or reassigned to address expected surges in COVID-19 patients, the health system says.
M Health Fairview is the brand for clinical health care at Fairview Health Services, which includes the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis. Last year, Fairview employed more than 33,000 people across a health system that includes 10 acute care hospitals, more than 100 clinics, a large pharmacy business and long-term care facilities.
“These changes were driven by a decreased patient census, a result of the indefinite postponement of non-critical procedures and a broad transition to virtual care,” Fairview said in a statement. “Decreased patient census coincides with the need to increase spending significantly on new equipment and supplies related to COVID-19.”
Mayo Clinic pledged on March 23 that allied health staff — a group of 65,000 people that includes everyone but physicians and scientists — would continue to be paid their current rate of pay for normally scheduled hours through April 28. That’s significant because the deferment of elective care has meant some staff don’t have any work right now, the clinic says, adding that Mayo needs those workers ready for redeployment.
Even so, the Rochester-based health system said Tuesday it was putting a hold on the projects that employ supplemental or contract workers due to short-term financial realities.
“The temporary elimination of elective surgeries, procedures and outpatient visits in order to protect our patients and health care providers from COVID-19 and conserve essential personal protective equipment will cause significant declines in revenue,” the clinic said in a statement. “Mayo Clinic leaders have adopted several strategies to manage expenses that will allow us to continue our focus on the needs of our patients.”
Essentia Health said on Monday it was placing nonmedical employees on unpaid leave in the face of an expected revenue decline of 20% to 40%.
With the cut in elective procedures, the Star Tribune reported last week that more than 10,000 Minnesota health care workers had applied for unemployment assistance over a 10-day period, more than quadruple the number who applied for the financial assistance in all of last year.
Large health systems that run hospitals and clinics say they are stopping short of outright layoffs, but two private medical practices tell the Star Tribune they’ve had to furlough a significant share of their workers due to the shutdown of elective procedures.
Moves by governors across the country to halt elective procedures are likely to drive revenue declines for many hospitals, according to Moody’s Investors Service, which follows the nonprofit health care sector.
Federal legislation passed last week is providing more than $100 billion to hospitals to offset the suspension of elective and noncritical services, “which should provide liquidity support,” Moody’s said in a statement last week. Even so, the rating agency said it expected “coronavirus to have a significant negative impact on hospital cash flow this year.”
Allan Baumgarten, an independent health care analyst in St. Louis Park, said via e-mail: “I think losing most elective surgeries is potentially a huge blow to hospitals and their doctors. Those surgeries are significant revenue (and profit) producers.”"
"March 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/helping-americans-cope-with-economic-shock/569140532/,StarTribune,Helping Americans cope with economic shock,"The federal government is throwing a lifeline to Americans as a global pandemic tightens its grip on this nation — a $2 trillion recovery package meant to soften the economic damage sustained in the fight to quell the coronavirus.
The plan, which passed the Senate unanimously and now heads to the House, is unprecedented in size and scope, and rightly so. The fast-spreading coronavirus has upended the American economy. Within weeks we went from the longest recovery in the nation's history to a record 3 million Americans filing for unemployment as businesses, schools and gathering places shuttered.
For the most part, the plan adheres to the principles laid out last week by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis, in a Star Tribune editorial. It will offer one-time direct payments to an estimated 80% of Americans, with an average payout of $1,200. Regrettably, the package was nearly derailed Wednesday when several Republican senators objected to extra unemployment benefits of $600 per week.
That is hardly a munificent amount. For someone suddenly out of work in the Twin Cities, the monthly total unemployment benefit would increase $2,400. Thankfully, a provision that extends unemployment 13 weeks was preserved.
Small businesses can tap loans, many of which can be forgiven if they commit to keeping workers on the payroll. This is imperative for curbing the surge in unemployment claims. The health care system will receive needed funding as it scrambles to handle the pandemic's impact.
Corporations will get help too — a lot of it. That is necessary. Large corporations employ thousands and are pillars of the nation's economy. A strong airline system must be sustained. It is entirely appropriate, however, to attach conditions to that assistance. The watchdog provisions that some fought for in the Senate are needed to guard against giveaways that do little to alleviate the crisis. There should be more rules, but the need for quick passage is the overriding goal right now.
A six-month suspension of student loan debt also makes sense. That will offer at least temporary relief to many who will struggle in a stay-at-home economy just to keep up living expenses.
There is some relief for states as well, although more may well be needed. Minnesota has a good cushion of budget reserves, but the projected $1.5 billion surplus is no doubt gone in the economic contraction. Revenues will take a serious hit just at a time when demand for services will go up. If unemployment claims continue at the current rate, the state may exhaust its unemployment fund in a few months, and would be forced to get loans from the federal government.
There are flaws in this bill, certainly. And as large as it is, it may only be an installment on what is needed to see the U.S. economy and Americans through this viral disaster. The House should follow the Senate's lead and President Donald Trump's urging and immediately pass it in a bipartisan vote. Doing so would send relief to Americans — and the nation's health care system — within weeks."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/gas-prices-slip-below-1-at-some-minnesota-gas-stations/569279042/,StarTribune,Gas prices slip below $1 a gallon at some Minnesota gas stations,"This is not a cruel April Fools’ Day joke. A gallon of gas on Wednesday morning was going for less than $1 at a few Minnesota gas stations, and prices at some stations in the metro had dropped to $1.06.
Analysts say the lowest gas prices in nearly two decades have been brought on as the demand for oil has dropped precipitously as lockdowns such as Minnesota’s “Stay at Home” directive to combat the coronavirus pandemic has kept drivers off the roads.
“This is an unprecedented event,” said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, the travel and navigation app that allows motorists to report gas prices. “We’re experiencing one of the biggest historical collapses in gas prices, including the Great Recession of 2008.”
On Wednesday, GasBuddy was reporting 99 cent gas at VP Racing Fuel in Red Wing, Minn. and $1.04 at a nearby Kwik Trip. The Hi Hi Market Gas in Lakeville had the metro area’s lowest price at $1.06 a gallon, according to the app.
Other stations in Lakeville, including the Kwik Trip on Kenwood Trail, posted prices at $1.09 a gallon.
In Minneapolis,the cheapest gas was $1.59 a gallon at a BP station at W. 36th Street and S. Lyndale Avenue. The state average price on Wednesday was $1.82, according to the app.
In recent days a widely circulating Facebook post warns motorists that they can contract COVID-19 by touching gas pump handles. But the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said chances of contracting COVID-19 by touching a gas pump handle is low. The CDC maintains that person-to-person contact is the main method of transmission.
“It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the way the virus spreads.”
But low gas prices are likely to spread. The national average could fall to $1.49 a gallon by mid-April with hundreds of stations selling gas for 99 cents, according to GasBuddy."

Tim Walz's State of the State to be streamed online Sunday,"Gov. Tim Walz's State of the State address, postponed last week due to the coronavirus pandemic, will take place Sunday night — livestreamed on YouTube.
The governor previously planned to deliver his second annual speech on March 23 in the State Capitol. He canceled the event as the coronavirus spread and the Legislature effectively recessed. He also has been forced to self-quarantine after coming in contact with a member of his security detail who has COVID-19.
Walz's virtual State of the State will be livestreamed from the governor's residence at 7 p.m. Sunday via YouTube Live. Viewers can tune in to the Office of the Governor of Minnesota YouTube channel, and various local news outlets will also broadcast the event, including the Star Tribune.
During a daily briefing with media on Wednesday, Walz described what will be an abnormal scene for a State of the state address.
""It will be me in my residence with a remote camera. That will be something unusual, but it is appropriate at this time as the character of Minnesota is shining so brightly that we address where we're at, but more importantly, where we are going,"" Walz said.
This is not the first time a governor has used the stately St. Paul residence as the setting for the annual speech. Former Gov. Jesse Ventura gave the address there in 2002. Governors traditionally have delivered the State of the State in the Capitol, which Walz did last year. Some state leaders have traveled to other parts of Minnesota to give the address."
"April 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/twins-offer-financial-help-to-staff-hurt-by-virus-canceled-games/569303172/,StarTribune,Twins offer financial help to staff hurt by virus-canceled games,"Gino Terrell was supposed to be spending Thursday afternoon at Target Field, high-fiving fans and interacting with the Twins’ TC Bear mascot as part of the “Rally Squad” at the home opener against the A’s. It’s one of the 60 or so home games the Hamline University graduate was planning to work this season, an important source of his summertime income.
Terrell is one of about 1,400 part-time Twins employees who won’t get the chance to work that game, canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. But he and the rest of the Twins’ ballpark workers — the ticket-takers and ushers and scoreboard and elevator operators and security personnel, among others — will still get at least part of their wages.
By the end of the week, the Twins will distribute partial April wages to each of those employees, doling out a significant portion of the $1 million pledge the team made, and now appears certain to exceed that mark by at least $200,000, to its seasonal workers.
“To me, it’s a huge deal. To a lot of people it is,” said Terrell, who has worked Target Field games for the past three seasons. “I can’t do my other job [as a brand ambassador at corporate events] either. There aren’t any gigs during coronavirus. So I’m looking for ways to make money, and [getting a Twins paycheck] would be huge.”
That’s the idea, Twins President Dave St. Peter said.
“We recognize that, when you’re dealing with a couple thousand employees, there are some people who rely on their income from Twins games,” he said. “I know many also work Wild or Wolves or Vikings games, and now their sole source of income is gone. In some cases, it’s absolutely critical for people trying to pay rent and go about their lives during all this.”
The Twins hope to go a step farther, too. Workers at the stadium’s concession stands, cleaners who sweep up the stands after games, even the baby sitters who mind the players’ children in the team’s family room — none of them are Twins employees. There are roughly 800-900 such workers, employees of companies who work on contract with the Twins, and with the baseball season on hold, many of them have been laid off with little or no assistance from their employers.
For them, the Twins are setting up the Target Field Employee Assistance Fund, and making a “significant” (though unspecified) contribution as seed money to help workers in need. Within the next 10 days, St. Peter said, the Twins intend to contact them and begin taking online applications for those funds, “in hopes of making emergency response grants sometime by the middle of April.”
Some Twins players and other employees “have approached us about contributing to that fund, with the hopes that those dollars will find their way to help seasonal ballpark employees who might be in need,” St. Peter said. “We put a lot of emphasis on the players on the diamond, but there are hundreds if not thousands of people who over the course of a season help shape the Target Field experience, and who are going through a time of need.”
Delaware North Sportservice operates all concession stands at Target Field and at least 20 other Major League ballparks, a business that also includes dozens of arenas, concert venues, casinos and airports and generated more than $3 billion in revenue last year. The company, owned by Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs, is the largest non-Twins employer at Target Field, and last month announced it was laying off all 55,000 part-time workers, plus 3,100 full-time employees.
The Twins have committed to no layoffs among their 400 full-time Minnesota employees at least through April, too. But they aren’t the only pro sports teams in Minnesota trying to keep their employees compensated while games are canceled. The Wild, for instance, have continued to pay all employees for games that weren’t played.
“I don’t want to oversell this. I don’t want it to appear that we’re making every employee whole, because we’re not. We can’t,” St. Peter said. “We’ll take it month to month. Ultimately, playing baseball again is the best way to generate paychecks for our employees. But for now, it’s going to be helpful relief at a time when rent checks are due.”"
"April 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-midwest-factory-conditions-plunge-because-of-coronavirus/569283692/,StarTribune,"Minnesota, Midwest factory conditions plunge because of coronavirus","A key index measuring factory conditions in Minnesota and across the Midwest plummeted to record lows in March as many producers reported that the coronavirus crisis created major shipping problems, forced workers home and shoved confidence levels to new lows.
Although the Midwest experienced a deeper drop, the slowdown exists across the nation, according to closely watched economic reports released Wednesday.
The Mid-America Business Conditions Index for Minnesota and eight other central states fell to 46.7 from February’s 52.8, according to Creighton University, which produces the report. Anything under 50 indicates a contraction.
Minnesota’s index plunged to 45.5 from 53.3 in February as new orders and sales, employment and inventory levels fell to levels not seen since the 2008 recession.
Economists are paying attention, especially since the nine-state region had been recovering after a bumpy end to 2019.
On the national front, the Institute for Supply Management reported Wednesday that its producers index fell to 49.1 in March from 50.1 in February.
All indications are that factories will continue to see dips in productivity.
“I expect negative impacts for manufacturers to worsen in the next month since almost two-thirds of supply managers reported that the coronavirus produced shipping problems to and from vendors,“ said Ernie Goss, director of Creighton University’s Economic Forecasting Group.
Additionally, “eight of 10 supply managers reported that the coronavirus had caused the cancellation of business meetings, and 54.3% indicated that the virus had produced worker absences for the month.”
The surveyors and manufacturing experts concede that America’s manufacturing sector was less impacted than other industries such as stores, restaurants and bars. However, the sector did not escape as demand for products dropped and states started to restrict certain business.
Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM manufacturing index committee, said that “things got worse” for U.S. manufacturers as March dragged on. He predicted that the national index will signal more weakness in April.
New orders, imports and factory employment fell last month to the lowest level since 2009 across the country. Production and export orders also fell.
“Manufacturing is not, for the most part, in the very front line of the virus hit, but nonetheless large swathes of the sector are vulnerable as consumers cut back on spending on goods, especially big-ticket items like cars and trucks,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research report. He added that “while this headline ISM reading is a pleasant-looking surprise, don’t be fooled.”
Between the second and third week of March, Minnesota’s first-time unemployment insurance claims expanded 29-fold as companies started to shut down businesses because of stay-at-home instructions and large decreases in demand for nonessential products.
Nationally, private payrolls dropped in March for the first time in 2½ years, likely as businesses shut down in compliance with strict measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic, supporting economists’ views that the longest employment boom in history probably ended last month.
The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls fell by 27,000 jobs last month, the first decline since September 2017, after advancing by an unrevised 183,000 in February. The payrolls drop last month was concentrated among small businesses, while larger companies added workers.
“All signs point to a labor market in crisis, and the widespread impact from COVID-19 will cause disruptions to the economy and everyday life unlike anything ever seen before,” said Dante DeAntonio, an economist with Moody’s Analytics.
Manufacturing shutdowns in March were led by the Big Three automakers temporarily closing factories.
Among Minnesota companies, recreational vehicle makers Polaris and Winnebago temporarily shut plants and suspended production because of the COVID-19 outbreak that drove consumers indoors and forced millions of office workers to work from home.
The virus caused shipping delays across the Mid-America region — which also includes Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Arkansas — and prompted several producers to tear into existing inventories, even as they raced to switch from overseas or distant suppliers to companies much closer, the Creighton report said.
While some companies have retooled to meet health care needs such as face shields, masks or ventilators, others are still cutting back. On Wednesday, Doosan Bobcat announced it will shut its loader, excavator and parts factories in Litchfield and North Dakota from April 6 to April 20 and its North Carolina portable-power factory starting April 4 because of the virus.
Maplewood-based 3M announced in January that it was cutting 1,500 jobs worldwide as it braced for a slowdown in the auto and aerospace industries and an ongoing slowdown in China. It is not clear how many job cuts took place in March.
In the midst of 3M’s restructuring, as the coronavirus spread, 3M continually increases production levels at factories making its N95 respirator masks and other necessary items during the outbreak. 3M respirator plants are now running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including those in Aberdeen, S.D., and Valley, Neb.
3M will further increase its monthly U.S. production of the masks from 35 million to 50 million masks by June, CEO Mike Roman said on Tuesday."
"April 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-health-officials-continue-to-conceal-names-of-senior-care-facilities-with-coronavirus/569291652/,StarTribune,Minnesota health officials continue to conceal names of senior care facilities with coronavirus,"Despite the mounting death toll from the novel coronavirus, Minnesota state health officials continue to conceal vital information that could affect thousands of state residents: the names and locations of the growing number of long-term care facilities where residents and staff have tested positive.
The Minnesota Department of Health has repeatedly declined to disclose the information, citing concerns that releasing the names of facilities would violate state privacy laws by potentially exposing the identities of those infected with the virus. The agency has insisted on keeping the facility names confidential even as officials in other states — including California and Colorado — have provided the names and locations of long-term care facilities with confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
State health officials face growing pressure to release the information as the number of confirmed cases and fatalities accelerate in senior care facilities, which have scrambled to quarantine infected residents. So far, 11 of Minnesota’s 17 coronavirus fatalities have occurred among residents in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Statewide, 38 residents and 22 staff of long-term care facilities have been infected — exceeding any other setting. One facility, which has not been identified, has six confirmed cases, state officials said.
Minnesota’s limited disclosure of facility data has been criticized by some public health experts, who say the information would help people make more informed decisions about where to place their loved ones. The information could also help the public detect patterns, such as whether particular facilities or nursing home chains have multiple COVID-19 cases and should be avoided, and find possible links between the cases and facilities with poor infection-control records.
Families are also clamoring to know whether any particular senior living facilities have become hot spots for the virus, so they can determine whether they should bring their loved ones home. Such dangerous clusters of cases have become more common. Among the first contagion hot spots was a nursing home in Kirkland, Wash., where two-thirds of the residents fell ill and at least 37 have died. A nursing home near Nashville had to be closed this week after an outbreak left two dead and more than 100 sickened.
More than 400 long-term care facilities nationwide have at least one infected resident, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“This is literally about life and death. I cannot imagine a more dangerous place for an elderly and vulnerable person to be than to be in a facility that has experienced an outbreak,” said Jennifer Wright, an elder law attorney from Roseville whose mother lives in a senior care facility. “It’s absolutely critical for the public to know which facilities have [COVID-19 cases] or this could jump from facility to facility like wildfire.”
Since the outbreak began, the state Health Department has encouraged nursing homes and assisted-living facilities to notify residents and their family members of any confirmed cases of COVID-19, and provided them with a one-page form to do so. Even so, there are still no consistent, industrywide standards for disclosure. The result is that communications have varied, which has contributed to growing public paranoia over the virus’ spread, elder care advocates say.
Administrators at several home care agencies in the Twin Cities said they have become reluctant to send nurses or other caregivers into long-term care facilities because they are unsure which sites have infected residents, and they do not want staff to get infected and spread the disease elsewhere.
In a statement, a spokesman for the Health Department said the agency cannot release the names and locations of the facilities because doing so would violate Minnesota’s data practices act, which says that public agencies cannot provide data in a way that identifies an individual. The agency also said it is concerned that disclosing facility names could give a “false sense of security” to the public that facilities without COVID-19 cases are protected from the disease.
“People may be tempted to want to move someone out of a facility into another facility or setting that they deem ‘safer’ when in fact it might not be and doing so could increase the risk of COVID for everyone,” an agency spokesman said.
So far, the Health Department has revealed only the type of long-term care facilities where residents and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 and the counties where they are located.
Officials in some other states are more forthcoming. For instance, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it releases the names and locations of long-term care facilities with confirmed COVID-19 cases to any member of the public who requests the information. Many counties in California and Washington state also release names and locations of facilities. But disclosure policies vary: State health officials in Florida, Michigan and Oregon, for instance, said they still withhold names of the facilities.
“The public health of the community and state should take precedence over potential violations of privacy in an emergency pandemic situation such as this one,” said Joseph Gaugler, a professor who focuses on long-term care and aging at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health. “If the naming of facilities can help with surveillance and management efforts of COVID-19 to manage outbreaks both within and beyond these facilities and redirect scarce resources then this should occur with all haste.”
Some long-term care providers see it as beneficial to disclose cases as quickly as possible.
For instance, Roseville-based Presbyterian Homes & Services, which operates 48 senior living communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, said it has had three confirmed cases in its facilities in the past two weeks. These include two cases at a single facility, Johanna Shores in Arden Hills. Within 24 hours after each positive test result, the nonprofit provider has notified residents in each facility of the cases, the health status of the infected residents, and the measures it is taking to prevent further spread of the virus. So far, none of the residents who have been infected with the disease have died.
“We’ve found that this approach helps mitigate anxieties, fosters cooperation and reinforces the trust they hold in us,” said Cindy Ray, a spokeswoman for Presbyterian Homes & Services.
But the absence of a consistent, statewide standard around disclosure has sown confusion among many family members and caregivers.
Cathy Lauring, a nurse practitioner and vice president at Lifesprk Health, a company in St. Louis Park that provides health services in a dozen senior living communities, said facilities should, at a minimum, be posting signs in their entryways when they have residents with COVID-19. Lauring said such signs have been a common safety precaution during influenza outbreaks, but she has not seen them being used in response to the coronavirus.
“At times like this, transparency is critical,” Lauring said. “When facilities share nothing, it heightens that sense of confusion and fear.”
Suzanne Scheller, an elder law attorney from Champlin, said the lack of location-specific information has served to “compound fear and paranoia” among residents and families, at a time when facilities across the state have imposed unprecedented restrictions on personal visits.
“Disclosure becomes so much more important when you realize how quickly this virus can spread,” Scheller said. “If families feel that information is being withheld, they tend to assume the worst.”"
"April 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/disease-data-modeling-in-minnesota-and-elsewhere-in-public-spotlight/569333722/,StarTribune,"Disease data modeling, in Minnesota and elsewhere, varies greatly","No one knows for sure how bad COVID-19 will get.
Data modeling by Minnesota experts predicted as many as 50,000 deaths in the state, while a University of Washington model estimated fewer than 2,000.
Nationally, the Imperial College of London predicted 2.2 million deaths if the U.S. did nothing to slow the corona­virus causing the pandemic, while the same Washington analysts recently lowered their estimates from 200,000 deaths to 93,000 because mitigation strategies such as Minnesota’s two week “stay-at-home” order appear to be working.
While the variations have caused confusion in an increasingly homebound and anxious public, data modelers said they are to be expected as the nation’s top health care analysts plug differing assumptions into their formulas about this unfolding COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s not really that one model is that much better or that much worse,” said Dr. Henry Ting at Mayo Clinic, which has examined 13 COVID-19 models in the development of its own. “The key is the assumptions you’re putting into these models. Those are driving the differences.”
Modeling by the Minnesota Department of Health and the University of Minnesota persuaded Gov. Tim Walz to announce the current stay-at-home order. The modeling is conservative, perhaps pessimistic, about the course of the outbreak, said Stefan Gildemeister, state health economist, but the Washington model may be optimistic and overlooking risk factors in the United States that could make the outbreak worse.
“Saying that the Washington approach is optimistic is not saying that we think we’re right,” he said. “Some of our assumptions might have turned out to be unusually conservative. In fact, we’ve been saying this from the beginning. We will continue to test our assumptions and change them.”
The Minnesota modeling wasn’t designed to forecast deaths but rather how much they would decline under social distancing restrictions. Gildemeister and colleagues concluded that deaths could decline by one-third under the current stay-at-home strategy — primarily by delaying the surge of cases so that hospitals have more time to prepare.
When it comes to the death numbers, any change in assumptions makes a dramatic difference. The Minnesota researchers used hospitalization and death rates that increase with age and were first used by colleagues at Imperial College.
The spreading factor
The local researchers also used a so-called R-naught estimate that one Minnesotan carrying the coronavirus would spread it on average to 2.5 people, whereas initial global estimates were only 2.2.
In the world of R-naughts, tenths can make a substantial difference in estimating how rapidly a virus can spread, said Dr. Frank Rhame, a virologist for Allina Health. “Over a couple of months, 2.2 and 2.5 is a big difference.”
With no interventions at all, the Minnesota model estimated 74,000 deaths in the state. Under the current stay-at-home strategy, it estimated around 50,000. However, Rhame said the reduced face-to-face contact in Minnesota could be reducing the R-naught, which in turn would reduce infections and deaths.
The addition of ventilators could help as well, as the Minnesota model predicts local hospitals will run out before the COVID-19 outbreak peaks. Globally, only around 5% of COVID-19 cases have needed hospital intensive care, and fewer yet have needed ventilators to compensate for the severe respiratory symptoms that can occur. But death risks increase dramatically when people don’t have ventilators available when needed.
The Minnesota model also assumed that people with COVID-19 needing intensive care would remain in hospital ICU units on average for 23 days. The actual length of stay could be shorter, which would mean more availability of beds and ventilators.
The length of stay “affects available resources, and that affects the timing of when we reach overcapacity, and that affects [the rate of] mortality,” Gildemeister said.
The differing models agree that hospitals are slated to be overrun. ProPublica published data from the Harvard Global Health Institute that Minnesota would need 2.9 times as many hospital beds as it has available if only 40% of its population were infected over the next year.
“Models are models,” said Dr. Rahul Koranne of the Minnesota Hospital Association. “They’re all going to be somewhat wrong. But if they all say a surge is coming, that you need to prepare now, and that social distancing matters, then let’s do that and work hard at doing that.”
Modeling by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has grown in prominence and was highlighted this week by Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.
The results of that model are updated daily with new information from states on both their deaths and the dates on which they implement prevention strategies.
Deaths vs. infections
A key difference from the approach of the Minnesota model and others is that it is based on deaths, rather than infection counts, said Ali Mokdad, University of Washington chief strategy officer for population health. “We have much better data on death than we have on diagnosis, because people who need to be diagnosed are not being tested, because we didn’t have enough tests early on.”
The results suggest that interventions work, with death rates ebbing in hard-hit cities such as Seattle and San Francisco that reacted quickly, he said. “We were concerned that a shutdown in China doesn’t mean exactly the same as a shutdown in the U.S. Now we’re seeing it works here.”
The Washington model suggests an improving situation in Minnesota. It predicted a death toll of more than 2,000 in the state a week ago but only 932 as of Wednesday because of the apparent impact of Walz’s stay-at-home order.
While Minnesota’s real-life death tally is increasing, it hasn’t been at the exponential rate expected — which suggests the interventions are working, Mokdad said.
One concern about the Washington model is that it doesn’t directly account for the high level of obesity and chronic disease in the U.S., which could result in more severe illnesses and deaths than in China or other countries, Gildemeister said.
The Minnesota model was based on prior studies that demonstrated that people with chronic diseases were 7.6 times more likely to die from a COVID-19 illness than people without those conditions.
Minnesota modeling has predicted only a delayed peak in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations because of the mitigation strategies, and not a reduction of cases, but updated analysis may show differently, Gildemeister said.
“The hope is that we were wrong,” he said, “and that the peak is farther out and that mitigation in fact reduces the degree to which people transmit the disease.”"
"April 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/pelosi-couldn-t-help-herself-from-playing-politics-on-covid-19/569333682/,StarTribune,Pelosi couldn't help herself from playing politics on COVID-19,"Nancy Pelosi wasted no time getting to her point in her interview Sunday on CNN. After some wishes about good health, host Jake Tapper asked the House speaker if she agreed with President Donald Trump’s musings that the national lockdown could end by Easter. Pelosi might have disagreed on policy grounds — and later Sunday Trump extended the social distancing for another month — but instead she tore into Trump.
“What the president — his denial at the beginning was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where — it continues — his delay in getting equipment to where it’s needed is deadly,” she said. “And now I think the best thing would be to do is to prevent more loss of life, rather than open things up,” referring to the possibility of easing social distancing.
“I don’t know what the purpose of that is. I don’t know what the scientists are saying to him. I don’t know what the scientists said to him. When did this president know about this and what did he know? What did he know and when did he know it?” the speaker added, repeating the most famous line from the impeachment probe of Richard Nixon.
“That’s for an after-action review. But as the president fiddles, people are dying. And we have to — we just have to take every precaution.” First Nixon, then Nero.
Tapper wanted to make sure he heard that right: “But are you saying that his downplaying ultimately cost American lives?”
Pelosi: “Yes, I am.”
The speaker is a political professional who doesn’t pop off by accident. She clearly went into the interview with a plan to attack Trump at the start of a week when she knows that the infection and death tolls will mount.
Why go there? The cynical interpretation is that Pelosi and her allies have seen the polls that show a majority of the public approves of Trump’s handling of the pandemic. Perhaps she wants to undermine that perception. She may also be sending a message to her left-wing that even if Trump wins re-election, she will be happy to investigate and impeach him again for his virus response.
Whatever the reason, this was an ugly note when the public wants signs of cooperation across the government — and when Trump had been praising Democrats in Congress for helping to pass the $2.2 trillion relief bill. He also refrained last week from attacking Pelosi for delaying the relief bill to add non-virus earmarks like her $25 million for Washington’s Kennedy Center.
But Trump can never not respond to an attack and on Monday, after Pelosi’s Sunday comments, he hit back in a tweet. That doesn’t help matters at this moment. But remember who cast the first coronavirus stone."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-covid-19-infections-hit-742-with-53-new-cases-and-1-more-death/569319192/,StarTribune,"With COVID-19 hospitalizations rising in state, deal reached on treatment costs","Out-of-pocket treatment costs for some COVID-19 patients will be waived under an agreement announced Thursday with Minnesota’s nonprofit insurers, as the virus sends growing numbers to the hospital.
Under the deal, announced by Gov. Tim Walz and the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, cost-sharing for corona­virus testing will also be dropped and more telemedicine options will be available for insured patients.
The announcement comes weeks after state regulators urged the plans to bear the burden of COVID-19-related medical care, especially because a hospital stay can leave a patient with a cost-sharing bill of more than $1,000.
But there are some restrictions, and many people who work for large corporations, which self-insure and are outside the reach of state regulation, may still be required to make copayments, depending on their company’s policies.
Currently, 75 people are hospitalized for COVID-19, including 21 new patients reported today by the Minnesota Department of Health.
Due to more severe complications of the virus, 38 patients were in intensive care units — 11 more than Wednesday.
The confirmed COVID-19 Minnesota case count went up to 742 on Thursday, with 53 new infections.
There have been 18 fatalities in the state as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, including one new death of a 69-year-old Hennepin County resident.
Hospitals have been bracing for an influx of COVID-19 patients as the case count continues to climb.
An estimated 20% of those sickened will need some hospital care, with 5% of them requiring costly intensive care, according to estimates.
“Our goal is if you get sick with COVID-19 your focus should only be on getting better and recovering,” said Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Steve Kelley. “You shouldn’t worry about getting a bill that will ruin you financially.”
The new plan policy applies only to care at in-network hospitals. If there were to be a surge of patients, some hospitals might be full and patients might be forced to use a hospital that is not covered.
Kelley said the plans were not ready to address the out-of-network issue and that discussions will continue.
“The plans have been assessing the risk of this pandemic all the way along,” he said. “It took them a while to arrive at the point where they felt comfortable from a financial point of view.”
The Minnesota Council of Health Plans, which represents the nonprofit insurers, said its members have “stepped up in a voluntary capacity to support their member enrollees” and “we will continue to adjust as needed to combat the epidemic.”
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, the state’s largest insurer, said it had already waived copays for testing, dropped prior authorization requirements for COVID-19-related care and made it possible for members to get 90-day refills on some medications.
The insurer is among those that expanded telemedicine, including the use of popular apps such as FaceTime and Skype to interact with clinicians.
Clinics across the state have seen significant drops in patient visits of all kinds and have pushed for more telemedicine capability to provide continuity of care.
The decline in face-to-face visits is one reason health care systems are taking a financial hit.
A $50 million health care aid program passed by the Legislature recently has been flooded with requests.
“We got over 200 applications requesting more than $256 million dollars,” said Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm. “The request far outstrips that source of money.”
Long-term care facilities continue to be impacted by new positive cases being discovered in residents and staff.
There are now 47 facilities with known COVID-19 cases, with one location having a cluster of eight infections.
A total of 49 long-term care residents have caught the virus, including 11 who have died. Another 22 long-term care workers are also infected.
Notably, the seasonal flu outbreak has let up, with no influenza outbreaks in long-term care reported last week.
Flu-related hospitalizations have also plummeted, with just 27 admissions last week, the fifth consecutive weekly decrease. Since the flu season began last fall, more than 4,000 people had required hospital care, making it one of the more active seasons in the past few years.
As the flu wanes, community transmission of COVID-19 has brought Minnesota firmly into a new phase of the pandemic.
Nearly four weeks after the discovery of the first Minnesota case, about half of the known cases have originated in the state — 21% caught it from a known case and 30% were exposed locally but with the exact source not known, according to new data released by state health officials Thursday.
That information was gleaned from phone calls made by Health Department staff members to people who were diagnosed with the virus.
During epidemics, epidemiologists and other department staffers are reassigned from their ongoing tasks to find out how individuals got infected and who they may have passed it on to.
More than 1,600 calls have been made to close contacts, typically people in the same household or work colleagues, Malcolm said. They’ve also interviewed 700 health care workers who had been exposed.
Minnesotans who traveled internationally make up about 15% of all the state’s known cases, and another 3% caught it on cruise ships. The state’s first cases all had a link to travel."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-invokes-defense-production-act-on-3m-n95-respiratory-masks/569337532/,StarTribune,Trump invokes Defense Production Act on 3M N95 respiratory masks,"In an effort to speed up the distribution of desperately needed hospital masks, President Donald Trump issued an order Thursday mandating that 3M sell the Federal Emergency Management Agency as many N95 respirator masks as the agency says it needs.
The order to help meet FEMA’s needs comes under the Defense Production Act, which the president invoked a week ago.
3M did not respond Thursday to several calls for comment.
CEO Mike Roman said Tuesday that the company was working closely with FEMA and is on track to double global production of N95 masks to 2 billion a year in 12 months.
The Maplewood-based multinational company will boost its U.S. production by 40% to 50 million masks per month in about 60 days, he said.
Roman said 80% of 3M’s U.S. supply is being funneled directly into health care facilities, especially to the hardest-hit areas such as New York and Seattle, with the help of six large distributors.
The remaining 20% were being sent to fulfill federal government needs, with the most going to FEMA.
“The prioritization and distribution of all of our N95 respirators are being coordinated in close partnership with FEMA, and we are directly embedded with them at their headquarters to help streamline decisionmaking and action,” Roman said.
Trump’s order on Thursday comes a month after Vice President Mike Pence, in charge of the federal response to the pandemic, visited 3M headquarters and praised the company for “playing a vital role in the health of our nation.”
It is unclear what role Trump’s new order could play in pushing more inventory to FEMA.
Besides ramping up N95 respiratory manufacturing, 3M also has announced a partnership with Ford to produce thousands of additional air-powered respirators called PAPRs.
These masks differ from N95 masks but also are seen as a critical tool in combating the spread of COVID-19 to health care workers.
Demand for the respirators has continued to climb as shortages emerged around the world.
N95 masks cited in Trump’s order are approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and are considered the gold standard among medical professionals because they filter out at least 95% of micro particulates and give doctors and nurses the best chance of not breathing in the coronavirus.
Trump also said on Thursday that he had given the secretaries of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security power to secure supplies for other vital health care equipment and devices.
Trump noted support for Medtronic, General Electric, Hill-Rom, ResMed, Royal Philips and Vyaire Medical to build ventilators that are also critically needed.
“I am grateful to these and other domestic manufacturers for ramping up their production of ventilators during this difficult time,” Trump said. “Today’s order will save lives by removing obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators.”
In issuing the orders, Trump said his actions were critical to “ensure that our health care systems are able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19.”
He said it “is critical that all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 are properly distributed to the nation’s health care systems and others that need them most at this time.”"
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/cultural-impacts-of-the-coronavirus-crisis/569364052/,StarTribune,Cultural impacts of the coronavirus crisis,"A raw crisis is always revealing. The transition from “before” to “after” changes how people think about things.
Sometimes it exposes fragility, as the coronavirus pandemic has done with preparedness for a type of public health disaster that was long-predicted and well-telegraphed even in the months before it mushroomed. But clarity also comes, counterintuitively, with the reintroduction of nuance into areas of discussion that had slipped into polarity.
A few thoughts on the cultural impacts of the novel coronavirus and the outbreak of the disease it produces, COVID-19:
Not all that seems bad is all bad.
In recent years, it’s been common to read and hear laments about the intrusion of technology into our lives.
Thank goodness for technology. Through video calls and other means of instant communication, loved ones separated by social distancing can stay in contact — even those at enhanced risk, even those quarantined.
At a time when people can’t — or shouldn’t — attend church, they can continue the practice of faith by viewing services and studies online.
While schools are closed, teachers can continue educating children. And many workers and workplaces are discovering that they were better prepared than they thought for remote activities.
All of these forced discoveries come with limitations, but also with implications for how we operate in the future.
Not all that seems good is all good.
Unimpeded by geophysical barriers, the footprint of Twin Cities metropolitan area over recent decades splayed to 3,000 square miles across seven counties (or up to 11,000 square miles across 22 counties, depending on how broadly you wish to define it). Government planning, the enterprise of developers and the desires of home buyers all have arguably played a role.
Some planners and political leaders would like to change this pattern to address global climate change. Nonetheless, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the Twin Cities area’s relative lack of density — and relative unreliance on systems like mass transit — has been a benefit, slowing the pace of coronavirus transmission compared with more congested locales.
It may be a temporary advantage at best. A virus is a force of nature. Nonetheless, the crisis has become a peg for discussion of this topic. Katherine Kersten, who opposes densification efforts, addresses it in a concurrent Opinion Exchange essay, and the Star Tribune Editorial Board will offer its own further thoughts later this week. Which brings us to:
Be duly skeptical of those who would use the pandemic, too indirectly and too soon, as leverage for prior goals.
In reviewing opinion submissions, editors often note that the most meaningful analysis of any event is not necessarily that which arrives immediately. In a singular event, it may begin arriving two or three days later, and in an ongoing event like the pandemic, thinking evolves over time. There’s a reason why newspapers are referred to as providing the first draft of history.
Yet calls for change using the current crisis as evidence are inevitable.
On the large end of the scale, for instance, you might hear the case made that Medicare for All, if it had been in place, could have eased pressures. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders made that argument in a recent Democratic presidential debate. Yet as his opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, pointed out, Italy has single-payer health care — and has been one of the hardest hit.
On the smaller end of the scale, you might hear about closing roads in favor of bicyclists and pedestrians. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board has done so in a few cases to enhance social distancing during the crisis, and conceivably the experience could bolster a pre-existing movement.
Remember that in any such debates, prior pros and cons still apply. And that if the epidemic demonstrates anything, it’s that worst-case scenarios can come true. Systems must be devised to withstand all possible outcomes.
Nonetheless, we can expect a crisis to produce at least some sweeping change and should be prepared to give it the broad analysis it deserves.
From World War II came the GI Bill, which helped millions of returning war veterans establish themselves in their communities. Internationally, the multibillion-dollar Marshall Plan helped Europe rebuild, creating the conditions for Western dominance in the mid-to-late 20th century.
The 13-day Cuban missile crisis of 1962, during which the exchange of diplomatic messages between the U.S. and Soviet Union was dangerously slow, expedited an idea for a “hotline” between the two countries. (The result was a system for quickly sending text communications, not a red telephone as is commonly portrayed.)
Out of 9/11 came years of ostensibly thwarted terror attacks, though at the cost of war and reduced standards, including torture.
What might transpire from the current crisis?
We’re getting a sneak peak at the impact of reducing carbon emissions. We’re getting a partial test of the deficit spending that some theorists believe a country with its own currency could safely incur in the pursuit of economic fairness. We’ll need to expand voting by mail to protect elections, which can never be bypassed. And we’ll surely, before this is over, weigh new concerns about privacy as cellphone tracking becomes a public health tool.
Above all, though, the true nature of our society has been revealed.
The losses of this crisis, and those yet to come, cannot be diminished. But our scenario hasn’t been like the apocalyptic ones found in fiction, where people turn animalistic, one against all. There’s been a touch of that for sure. But mostly we’ve seen friends, neighbors and families working within the confines of the circumstances to come together and aid others.
Mostly, we’ve been reminded that humanity is the way of our world."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/conducting-a-safe-national-election-during-a-pandemic-will-be-difficult/569364552/,StarTribune,Conducting a safe national election during a pandemic will be difficult,"Across the nation, medical professionals and first responders are mobilizing to combat and control the coronavirus — leveraging whatever materials and resources they have available to give patients the best chance of survival. The fight against COVID-19 is a war, and they are on the battlefield every day.
A similar spirit of ingenuity and determination will be needed for Minnesota’s election officials to administer the 2020 contests this fall. They face monumental challenges: Making it possible for voters to cast ballots when many may be inclined to stay home to avoid the risk of infection from the novel coronavirus. How can millions of voters who do cast ballots be protected from the virus?
The coronavirus is already affecting the 2020 elections. State after state has altered the primary election calendar as the risk to voters and election personnel grows. Large numbers of poll workers in Wisconsin are already balking at showing up for its April 7 primary out of fear of infection. The critical primary states of Ohio and New York have delayed their elections and stretched out the Democratic presidential nomination contest.
The November elections must proceed unless Congress changes the date, which is highly unlikely. Election officials face the difficult challenge of moving ahead without putting voters and poll workers at risk.
The best option is to enable Americans to practice social distancing and vote. This is feasible by accelerating the recent shift from casting a ballot in person on Election Day to casting our ballots by mail. Minnesota’s Secretary of State Steve Simon is proposing to mail each registered voter a ballot this year to be completed at home and returned by mail. (Voting in person will remain an option for voters who cannot, or prefer not to, cast their ballots by mail.)
Let’s be candid, though. Minnesota — and many other states — are behind the eight ball in switching to vote-by-mail in only a few months. Five states now rely entirely on vote-by-mail; they devoted years to making the transition.
The “to do” list is long for Minnesota and other states:
Printing millions of ballots, putting them in envelopes, and mailing them to registered voters with return envelopes and postage. Dedicated machinery to open and tabulate mail ballots needs to be purchased, tested, and the personnel trained to use it.
A new, large budget is needed to pay for all of the above. (Mailing a single ballot and covering its return will cost $1.10.) Congress provided $400 million to states in the most recent coronavirus stimulus bill — funding that is badly needed but is only about a fifth of what many experts say is necessary to do the job.
Mailing ballots to all registered voters is the most effective and least costly approach to transition to voting from home. But many states — including Minnesota — lack the legal authority to make the switch. Will the Legislature pass new legislation immediately to authorize this shift? Can Gov. Tim Walz use his emergency powers to authorize it with an executive order?
The new process, higher costs and legal hurdles to retool elections will strap officials. The good news is that election officials in Minnesota are nationally recognized for their nonpartisan professionalism and resourcefulness in making do with less-than-perfect conditions in service of voters and our democracy.
Elections in Minnesota are a team sport. Secretary of State Simon consults and collaborates with cities, counties, and other stakeholders who appear ready to consider the transition to vote by mail. Already, this is common in Minnesota’s smaller towns where about 100,000 ballots are cast by mail.
Administrators from states that entirely vote by mail are sharing their experiences and advice, including the difficulty in making a sudden change.
Minnesotans have high expectations of our election officials — and they should. And, yet, the coronavirus is forcing all of us to adapt expectations. Given the speed, depth and breadth of the likely alterations to the election process, we should not expect the changes to be seamless or smooth. Election offices will be upending years of planning for November’s election and shifting to a new voting model on the fly.
Rules guiding the purchasing of new equipment, the normal legislative process and other changes will have to be altered or suspended — requiring flexibility from policymakers and others in state and local government. The process will be messy, and frustrating, and require patience from everyone involved.
Minnesota’s election officials should be encouraged (and allowed) to approach the 2020 election with the same spirit shown by medical professionals and first responders — recognizing that we are at war with the coronavirus and using whatever resources and expertise are available to win that fight. This commitment to “battlefield surgery,” while it may not be perfect or permanent, is out best chance to continue Minnesota’s nation-leading voter turnout record in a time of a pandemic."

On Thursday, three of seven trucks packed with 400 of Versare Solutions’ bed partitions were en route to the temporary hospital being built by the U.S. Army at CenturyLink Field Event Center in Seattle, said Doug Mark of Versare.
The stadium will be used to treat people who do not have the coronavirus.
Versare also received orders Monday from two Long Island hospitals needing to convert meeting and waiting rooms into treatment wards, the company said.
“They said they could not get these partitions fast enough,” said Jeff Eckerle, vice president of business development for the company.
Mark, a sales consultant, coordinated the effort, which put the 50-employee shop in northeast Minneapolis into overdrive.
Trucks hauling 350 partitions were headed to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset and another hospital in Ronkonkoma on Long Island.
New York state is the epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States with more than 92,000 cases verified statewide, 52,000 of them in New York City. Washington state has had nearly 6,000 cases verified.
Versare officials said they are also reaching out in case Minnesota needs to build extra care space in hospitals here.
In addition to the hospitals, Versare has made 3,500 partitions that are now en route to 11 distribution centers nationwide for a large grocery store chain. Those partitions will be used to build screening stations where grocery employees get their temperatures taken before being allowed to enter the store, Mark said.
Other orders Versare received last week were for scores of clear acrylic partitions that can separate customers and employees at pharmacies, stores and clinics.
Companies from Medtronic to 3M and Protolabs are ramping up production on much-needed medical devices and equipment.
Versare, which normally makes office cubicles and room dividers, has been so busy it called back laid-off workers so it could meet the demand for its new products. It’s now considering hiring 10 to 20 more people."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-health-plans-say-220-million-in-income-will-help-with-covid-19-costs/569352552/,StarTribune,Minnesota health plans say $220 million in income will help with COVID-19 costs,"Minnesota’s nonprofit health insurers posted about $220 million in operating income last year, a figure that the carriers’ trade group said is down from 2018 but still shows financial stability with the likely onset of COVID-19 medical bills.
In a release this week, the Minnesota Council of Health Plans said income of $219.8 million came on revenue of $15.8 billion, meaning the insurers collectively saw a margin of 1.4%.
The figures don’t cover all of the products sold by the carriers, but are focused solely on state-regulated health plans that last year covered roughly 2.4 million Minnesotans.
“Stability is important because it gives health plans the ability to maintain medical reserve funds, which they use to operate during large-scale emergencies and for other expenses,” the Minnesota Council of Health Plans said in a statement. “These funds will be especially important this year, as they will help plans support enrollees through the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Nonprofit health insurers are allowed to generate income from operations, much like investor-owned companies generate operating profits. The difference comes in what happens to earnings, since for-profit companies can distribute income to shareholders where nonprofit groups retain earnings for operations.
On Thursday, Gov. Tim Walz announced an agreement with the nonprofit health plans that will waive out-of-pocket treatment costs for some COVID-19 patients. The announcement came weeks after state regulators urged the plans to cover the costs of medical care related to COVID-19, especially because a hospital stay can leave a patient with a cost-sharing bill of more than $1,000.
The agreement doesn’t cover all employer health plans, however, and there are potential wrinkles depending on whether patients receive care at in-network hospitals.
The financial results released this week by the Minnesota Council of Health Plans cover seven health insurers: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota; HealthPartners; Hennepin Health; Medica; PreferredOne; Sanford Health Plan of Minnesota; and UCare.
The numbers cover the roughly 2.4 million Minnesotans enrolled in “fully-insured” health plans that are regulated by state government. They don’t include “self-insured” health plans operated by large multistate employers that hire the insurers as administrators.
Operating income figures do not include income from the health insurers’ investments. In annual filings this week with regulators, several insurers have noted those investment holdings have seen significant fluctuations as the stock market has plunged with the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In 2018, the health plans collectively posted operating income of about $448 million on $15.7 billion of revenue, for a margin of 2.9%. Put another way, the health insurers in 2018 made nearly 3 cents of income for every dollar of revenue, vs. 1.4 cents of income for every dollar of revenue last year.
The release shows that insurers spent $1.6 billion, or roughly 10% of revenue, on administrative expenses — roughly comparable with 2018. The health plans had an average of 3.11 months’ worth of expenses in financial reserve.
Like health insurers across the country, nonprofit carriers in Minnesota have eliminated cost-sharing for COVID-19 tests and expanded coverage for “virtual visits,” where doctors and patients communicate via telemedicine systems rather than face-to-face. The nonprofit carriers also are participating in a special enrollment period at MNsure, the state’s health insurance exchange, that’s giving uninsured individuals a chance to obtain coverage.
“We recognize the significant public health threat that COVID-19 poses, and our health plans are committed to working with state and federal regulators so that enrollees have access to needed testing and treatments as quickly as possible,” said Lucas Nesse, the chief executive of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, in a statement."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/5-million-relief-plan-in-minneapolis-would-aid-renters-homeless-small-businesses/569353162/,StarTribune,"$5 million relief plan in Minneapolis would aid renters, homeless, small businesses","Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey unveiled Friday a plan to give $5 million in assistance to tenants and small businesses struggling with the financial fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
The plan sets aside roughly $3 million for rental assistance and $2 million in loans for small businesses, though they are only forgivable for companies located in a part of the city already targeted for special assistance.
“We are not under the impression that the $5 million in assistance is a cure-all,” Frey told City Council members at a meeting Friday morning. “Sadly, we do not have the finances at the city to provide a cure-all without assistance from our federal and state partners.”
The mayor said he hopes the programs — collectively called the Gap Funding Plan — will help cover needs that aren’t met by state and federal aid. The city will not consider immigration status in determining individuals’ eligibility for help, Frey said.
The city expects to roll out applications for the programs in the coming weeks, with the money coming out very shortly afterward.
The city’s emergency assistance program will offer payments up to $1,500 for rent and utilities, with some households receiving $2,000 “under extraordinary circumstances,” the mayor told council members.
To qualify, families must live in Minneapolis, make 30% or less of the area median income — roughly $27,000 for a family of three — and have experienced “a significant loss of income ... due to COVID-19.”
To pay for that, the city is using money from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, as well as money that was freed up when the city got additional federal grant money.
The city is also dedicating $1 million within the existing Stable Homes, Stable Schools housing stability fund to help families struggling with homelessness or housing instability during the pandemic. In most cases, payments would be limited to $1,500 per household. To qualify, families would need to have at least one child enrolled in an elementary school in Minneapolis Public Schools and make 50% or less of the area median income — about $45,000 for a family of three.
For both programs, payments would go directly to the property owner or to a utility company if some of the money is needed to pay bills.
The plan also calls for the city to allocate $2.2 million for small businesses with 20 or fewer employees and people who are self-employed.
The city will offer forgivable no-interest loans ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, depending on their pandemic-related needs. The money can be used to help cover payroll and employee benefits, rent or mortgage payments and other “critical working capital needs.” Payments will not be required for the first 12 months, and the debt will eventually be forgiven if the businesses meet certain criteria, such as remaining in Minneapolis and staying open.
To qualify, the businesses must make $1 million or less in annual revenue and be located in an area designated by the city, such as Cultural Districts, the Promise Zone, Green Zone or areas of concentrated poverty.
Some council members questioned why the geographic boundaries were so strict.
“As soon as I saw the package, I thought those forgivable loans were a great deal,” Council Member Cam Gordon said, rattling off a list of businesses that he initially thought would be eligible.
“I thought, well here’s a great opportunity for them and then I realized when I looked at the boundaries that they would all be excluded, some of them by a block or two.”
Frey and other city officials said they hope that by focusing on businesses in those areas, they can reach people who are likely to be most vulnerable in the economic downturn."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/in-midst-of-pandemic-nation-is-getting-a-lesson-in-digital-inequality/569365822/,StarTribune,"In midst of pandemic, nation is getting a lesson in digital inequality","America came face to face with the festering problem of digital inequality when most of the country responded to the coronavirus pandemic by shutting elementary and high schools that serve more than 50 million children.
Even before the shutdown, an estimated 12 million children were having difficulty completing routine homework assignments — not to mention writing research papers — because they lacked the home internet access their better-off classmates take for granted.
The so-called Homework Gap has taken on crippling dimensions now that closed school districts have been trying to maintain a semblance of instruction by putting teachers or course materials online. Internet-savvy school systems that serve connected populations appear to be moving ahead relatively smoothly with the new order of business.
At the same time, some districts that lack infrastructure and serve heavily poor populations have given up altogether on remote learning. Still others are hesitant to pursue online instruction out of fear they might be hauled into court for offering course materials to which broadband-deprived families cannot gain access.
Jessica Rosenworcel, a Federal Communications Commission member who has been proselytizing on this issue for several years, has rightly called on the F.C.C. to use funds earmarked for connecting schools and libraries to the internet to provide schools with internet hot spots that could be lent to students. Beyond that, some members of the Senate are urging Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to set aside dedicated funding that would help to narrow the digital divide.
These suggestions address the exigencies of the moment. But the time has long passed for the country to open the door to the information age for communities that are locked out.
The daunting challenge of trying to get distance learning up and running comes as school districts are already struggling to feed students who rely on school breakfasts and lunches to stave off hunger. An analysis of policy statements by 46 districts that was released last month by the nonpartisan Center on Reinventing Public Education found considerable confusion among districts about how to deal with issues of technology and internet access.
Only about a third of the districts said they were working to deliver laptops or tablets to students. Only five said they were delivering mobile phones or wireless hot spots to students, while more were encouraging parents to sign up for internet service. Few districts had comprehensive learning plans, and most were sharing links to “optional assignments on publicly available websites.”
This scramble is taking place in an atmosphere of uncertainty over how long the shutdown will last. Districts will need more money — and new expertise — if it turns out that a comprehensive online infrastructure is needed for the long haul."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/despite-some-temporary-shortages-covid-19-panic-consumption-will-end/569365802/,StarTribune,"Despite some temporary shortages, COVID-19 panic consumption will end","People who live in New York City need never carry an umbrella. At the first sign of a cloud burst, nearly every corner has a ramshackle opportunist selling chintzy parasols for five or 10 bucks apiece.
Supply magically meets demand. Instantly and without orchestration. It’s a microcosm of the way the U.S. economy usually works. Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” rarely fumbles.
Needless to say, these aren’t normal times, as some supermarkets are emptied of toilet paper, rice, flour and other staples. Nevertheless, pandemic panic consumption shortly will be a distant memory. The recent grocery cart frenzy will seem pointless.
“All the grocery stores are going to have pallets of toilet paper sitting in the aisles, and nobody is going to buy it, because who needs to buy toilet paper when you’ve got a year’s worth sitting in your garage?” Daniel Stanton, a supply chain expert, recently told CNBC.
“The U.S. produces a huge amount of food. We’re also an exporter of food, so we’re going to be OK,” he said.
Hospitals may wait weeks or months to have all the protective clothing and advanced medical gear they’ll require as millions fall ill with the coronavirus. But, like the spontaneous umbrella sales force of Manhattan sidewalks, retailers are stepping up to meet the more prosaic needs of U.S. households, from food to pharmaceuticals.
Amazon, Walmart, Lowes and other retailers have announced plans to hire 444,000 more warehouse and delivery workers. Target and eight other major retailers have given employees a temporary pay bump as an incentive to face the perils and fatigue of keeping shelves stocked and checkout lines moving.
That said, widespread shortages of consumer staples in recent weeks reveal the shortcomings of market assumptions that don’t apply in times of trouble. While household goods are being restocked, two pervasive forces work against uninterrupted supplies of big-ticket items, from cars and appliances to laptop computers and cellphones.
First, supply chains that extend for thousands of miles make U.S. factories dependent on all manner of parts and materials made from as far away as China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. With the course of the pandemic’s spread unclear, so will be the reliability of foreign vendors.
After a devastating 2012 Pacific Rim tsunami, finding a red Toyota became a challenge. The Japanese factory that made the rosy paint pigment was battered and shut down by ocean waves.
The second current challenge is the likely shortage of inventory — in finished products and parts and materials. Where factory warehouses once brimmed with enough goods and components to last for months, today inventories are designed to be depleted in as little as 30 to 60 days.
“Just-in-time” manufacturing and supply chains — meant to pare the cost of keeping unused inventory on hand — now applies to everything from $2,000 laptops to $2 dish towels.
Apple, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai lead a growing list of companies that have warned of supply bottlenecks ahead.
For the time being, however, transitory shortages won’t rise to the level of emergency. In the midst of a recession that threatens to put millions of Americans out of work, shopping for new cars, fancier iPhones or stylish refrigerators won’t be an urgent impulse for some time to come."
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/u-s-china-tension-weakens-pandemic-response/569365772/,StarTribune,U.S.-China tension weakens pandemic response,"The worldwide fight against the coronavirus pandemic will be harder to win unless the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China improves.
That won’t be easy. Especially in light of a Bloomberg report that, according to a classified intelligence assessment, China hid the true scope of COVID-19 cases and deaths. While critics contend that the Trump administration’s initial response wasn’t ideal either, there is no equivalency: Beijing’s intended inaccuracies endangered not just China, but the world.
Nonetheless, lately there have there been signs that the two superpowers have attempted to communicate more constructively. Working together, however, is another matter. China may see this as an opportunity to try to position its governing model as better than the West’s. And yet some cooperation is needed to mitigate the growing coronavirus calamity.
Despite its lethal early errors, China may now be through the worst of its outbreak (based on suspect data, to be sure). America, conversely, must brace itself for a “hell of a bad two weeks,” according to President Donald Trump, who has finally reckoned with how virulent the virus is.
Working together will also be harder because Trump needlessly antagonized China and our allies by referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly insisted that similar language be included in a G-7 coronavirus communiqué. G-7 leaders balked, the statement was scrapped, and the U.S. needlessly alienated allies in a clear diplomatic misstep.
Even graver, a tit-for-tat spat that saw the Trump administration limit to 100 the number of U.S.-based journalists at Chinese outlets widely considered state propaganda was met with China kicking out 13 Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and New York Times journalists. This was once again a loss for the world, which needs independent reporting from China.
Fortunately, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping seems to have improved the dialogue. Trump has dropped the “Chinese virus” verbiage (although likely too late for the scores of Asian-Americans targeted with racism that may have been fueled by the president’s rhetoric). That’s a positive development as America scrambles to procure more medical supplies, and indeed on Sunday a flight from Shanghai carrying 80 tons of such supplies arrived in New York, the first of 22 scheduled flights. More will be needed — especially in countries struggling with basic health infrastructure.
“I don’t think you get a grip on this crisis in the long term without a coordinated global response,” Richard Gowan, U.N. and multilateral affairs director at the International Crisis Group, told an editorial writer. “You are going to need countries to join up their health cooperation, humanitarian assistance, if we’re going to bring this under control on a global scale.”
While the divergent, difficult U.S.-China dynamic will drive geopolitics for many years to come, the two sides must find a way to work together to contend with this crisis.
“At least in the short term,” Gowan said, “the two sides have to get a grip that without their cooperation, and that of other countries, they are going to make this disease much worse.”"
"April 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mayo-clinic-to-lead-national-covid-19-plasma-trial-coronavirus-treatment-minnesota/569355782/,StarTribune,Mayo Clinic to lead national COVID-19 plasma trial,"Mayo Clinic announced Friday it is leading a national trial to use donated plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 as a treatment for others infected by the novel coronavirus that causes the illness.
The cooperative effort with 40 institutions in 20 states could verify a vital treatment, given that nobody has immunity against the coronavirus that has quickly spread across the globe.
Administered in a handful of U.S. cases already, plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients could provide immune system boosts to others with the illness.
“Theoretically, it gives them an antibody boost, which should help them clear the virus,” said Dr. Michael Joyner, the Mayo doctor leading the program.
Joyner said hospitalized patients will be targeted for the therapy, but not just those with the worst symptoms in intensive care. Immune system overreactions could actually be hurting some of these patients, meaning that plasma therapy could be ineffective or even harmful in such cases.
“Certainly in patients that are extremely ill in the ICU, this is a possibility,” Joyner said. “The thought is that historically this type of therapy [in other conditions] has been most effective when used relatively early in the course of disease as people are getting sicker and sicker.
“We’re going to have people trying it for different indications, but I think that rescue therapy [for severe cases] is going to be an area where it’s probably going to be relatively less effective.”
As of Friday afternoon, Minnesota reported 789 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 156 people needing hospital care and 62 needing intensive care.
Given the rapid increase in hospitalized patients predicted throughout the country, interest in this experimental option could likely exceed availability, Joyner said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration formally approved the program on Friday after giving initial approval March 24 for plasma therapy as a COVID-19 treatment.
In a statement, Dr. Stephen Hahn, FDA commissioner, called this trial “an important area of research” and said his agency would expedite efforts to prove the therapy’s safety and effectiveness.
Given projections that as many as 40% of Americans could be infected with the coronavirus over the course of this pandemic, the supply of donor plasma would appear inexhaustible.
Finding donors could be complicated, though, at least at first.
Joyner said donors must have initial coronavirus tests that confirm their infections, and then have follow-up tests that confirm that they have recovered and that their plasma is safe to use.
Minnesota’s current case count includes more than 400 people who have recovered and are no longer subject to isolation restrictions to prevent them from spreading the virus.
However, most of them were cleared due to their fevers and symptoms going away.
Few, other than health care workers, have received second tests to confirm their ability to return to their jobs.
Shortages of chemicals, swabs and other supplies have hampered the ability of the state public health lab and others to even conduct initial diagnostic tests, much less follow-up tests.
Joyner said increases in COVID-19 testing capacity at Mayo and other institutions nationwide could help.
HCMC in Minneapolis, for example, started conducting its own testing for the coronavirus this week.
“I’m cautiously optimistic … but this is going to be a massive logistical pull,” Joyner said. “People have to understand that our ability to identify donors and collect the plasma is going to be a rate-limiting step for a matter of weeks.”
Mayo also is days away from announcing a serological blood serum test that can check for antibodies in patients who have recovered from their infections.
The antibody testing will become critical to the identification of good plasma donors, because the initial molecular diagnostic tests don’t measure antibody levels in their bloodstreams, said Dr. William Morice, president of Mayo Clinic Laboratories.
“Without having the antibody testing, its very much guesswork,” he said, “because we’re not really measuring … the level of antibodies and how potent they might be.”
Doctors treating COVID-19 cases at any hospital can register their patients at uscovidplasma.org for potential inclusion in the plasma trial."

Carmen Reinhart, co-author of the book “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,” had these thoughts about the coronavirus crisis:
Q: What is your take on what we are seeing so far?
A: You can’t have a standstill in economic activity and not expect serious balance-sheet consequences. My expectation is that we will see a big increase in bankruptcies at the household level, at the corporate level and at the sovereign level.
Q: Many people are looking to the Spanish Flu of 1918 for clues — what can we learn from how that pandemic played out?
A: We don’t really have historical antecedents for a lockdown of this scale. The last major one in 1918 was in World War I, and as is common with wartime economies, the big thing was production. Real GDP growth at the time was 9%, so we can’t really look to that period for lessons in economic effects.
Q: What are you worried about, that others aren’t realizing?
A: I worry a great deal about social unrest. The longer this lasts, the hardest-hit households will have less and less ability to cope. A prolonged scenario when people don’t have jobs, and things are shut down, is worrisome in terms of what it does to the human psyche. We haven’t really had this experience before.
Q: Since you have looked at hundreds of financial crises, any lessons that are helpful now?
A: This pandemic is going to leave countries, corporations and households with a lot of debt. We have to be open to a greater role for the restructuring of public and private debts. That’s the healthy way to go.
Q: How do you see this crisis developing from here?
A: Even in a good scenario, I don’t think we’re going to return to business as usual anytime soon. Think of global trade patterns and global supply chains, with everyone relying so heavily on other countries. And remember in 1918, influenza continued to circle the globe and kill people until 1920. This is going to depress global growth for some time.
Q: Let’s leave on a positive note — anything encouraging you see out of all this?
A: We are seeing broad consensus for distancing and quarantines, which is fundamental to how long this will last. It’s hard to measure that in economic terms, but that’s at the heart of global response, and that’s encouraging."
"April 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/3m-says-trump-s-order-allows-it-to-export-to-u-s-more-masks-made-overseas/569348552/,StarTribune,3M complies with mask production order but hits back on Trump administration claims,"3M hit back Friday at White House assertions that it was not doing enough to get needed N95 respirator masks to U.S. health care professionals, escalating tensions with the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump a day earlier invoked the Defense Production Act to compel the company to sell its face masks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency above other customers. In doing so, he and others in the administration portrayed 3M as putting the U.S. behind other countries in the fight against coronavirus.
The Maplewood-based company, usually tight-lipped about its operations and interactions with top officials, responded with an early-morning statement. Its chief executive, Mike Roman, subsequently gave several interviews with national media.
“The narrative that we are not doing everything we can to maximize delivery of respirators in our home country — nothing could be further from the truth,” Roman said on CNBC Friday morning.
Later in the day, Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to Trump in charge of policy related to the act, again criticized 3M.
“While hundreds of other large American multinationals are stepping up with pride and patriotism, 3M remains an outlier and its propaganda war must stop,” said Navarro, adding that the company was “operating like a sovereign profit-maximizing nation internationally.”
At the center of the conflict is Trump’s desire for U.S.-based makers of products that protect against or fight COVID-19 to direct them to Americans first. But for companies like 3M, that nationalist impulse conflicts with their global reach and customer base. For decades, multinational firms have made goods in multiple places around the world and shipped them where needed based on market principles and trade laws.
Trump last month used the same act, first invoked in the Korean War when U.S. companies chiefly made and sold goods domestically, to pressure General Motors into production of ventilators. Trump also expressed displeasure with GM when he used the act in that case.
On Thursday, Trump tweeted: “We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. ‘P Act’ all the way. Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing — will have a big price to pay!”
3M is the world’s leading maker of N95 face masks that filter out at least 95% of microparticulates. The company makes about 1 billion such masks annually in plants around the world. Since the COVID-19 outbreak began, 3M has said it will double production by the end of the year.
On Tuesday, Roman said 3M had directed 80% of its U.S. sales to health care professionals in the hardest-hit areas, with the other 20% going to federal agencies, with FEMA getting the most.
The new order prioritizes FEMA for 3M’s face masks.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Friday that the order confuses the issue. Trump has said numerous times that FEMA is a backup for health supplies and states should be primary buyers.
“We’re being told to go out and find these ourselves,” he said. “When we find them, we’re getting outbid by the federal government, and now they’re shutting off a source right here in Minnesota, apparently.”
In its statement Friday, 3M expressed concern that Trump’s order will force it to cease exporting U.S.-made masks to Canada and Latin America. In some countries, 3M is the only supplier of N95 respirator masks.
The company warned there are “significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to health care workers in Canada and Latin America, where we are a critical supplier of respirators,” the company said.
It also said that halting exports of N95 masks may lead other countries where it operates to retaliate by doing the same. “If that were to occur, the net number of respirators being made available to the United States would actually decrease,” 3M said.
Navarro denied that the administration told 3M to cease any exports and said that the order was to provide “all of the N95 respirators it can possibly muster to prevent Americans from dying.”
He further said: “All we get from the CEO on down to the head of their PR department is lie upon lie, the latest of which — which is dead wrong — is that we demanded 3M not send production from its U.S. plants to our friends and allies in Canada and Mexico.”
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the move to restrict the movement of N95 masks a “mistake,” asserting that trade of health supplies is moving both ways across the Canadian border.
The U.S. is not the only country restricting exports of medical supplies.
As of Wednesday, 68 nations had put limits on exports of medical supplies, according to tracking by Simon Evenett, a professor of international trade at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.
But compelling 3M to divert orders from its overseas factories to the U.S. could have repercussions, said Karthik Natarajan, a professor of supply chains and operations at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management.
“The other country could retaliate,” he said. “The other country might say, ‘We won’t sell you a product you might need.’ ”
The order could set a precedent as well, creating issues for more companies than 3M, he said.
Ernest Abbott, who was the general counsel of FEMA during the Clinton administration, also saw flaws in Trump’s order.
“Obviously the United States can say what they want to happen, but it’s not clear whether there is the legal power of the United States to force an operation in another country to violate the law of that country — even if it’s an American company,” he said.
3M said it had been working with the Trump administration to increase the number of the N95 masks coming to the U.S. from its overseas factories. Roman said China had approved an increase of exports from a 3M factory there and 10 million masks started being shipped this week.
“We’ve been telling the administration for days and days,” Roman said.
In February, the company started working with the administration, laying out all of its manufacturing capacity and any issues in ramping up and shifting its operations. On March 5, Vice President Mike Pence visited 3M’s headquarters and Roman said they had a “great discussion.” Pence praised 3M at the time for “playing a vital role in the health of our nation.”
At that point, 90% of the N95 respirators made in the U.S. were going to industrial customers. Now “almost everything” is going to health care customers, Roman said.
The administration helped pave the way for that shift more than a month ago with an emergency use authorization allowing those masks to be sold to hospitals and other health care providers.
Separately, 3M said it continued to act on reports of price gouging and unauthorized reselling of its respirator masks.
“Let me say this,” Roman said on CNBC, “the idea that 3M is not doing all it can to fix price gouging and unauthorized reselling is absurd.”"
"April 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/meet-jan-malcolm-minnesota-s-dr-fauci/569383652/,StarTribune,"At the head of state Health Department, Jan Malcolm is 'Minnesota's Dr. Fauci'","It was two months into the national crisis, and Jan Malcolm was calm, sitting with a pen and paper, fielding questions on quarantines, testing capacity and the spread of infectious diseases.
As head of Minnesota’s Department of Health, Malcolm reflexively kept coming back to the “public” part of the public health crisis, emphasizing the little things people can do to seize control of their lives at a time when it feels like they have none: Don’t smoke. Get plenty of rest. Wash your hands.
“We can’t be certain what’s ahead of us,” she said, “but the best way to fight back is to take charge of things that are in our control.”
That was nearly 20 years ago, shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Fear of a second bioterrorism attack permeated American homes. Malcolm addressed the public on a live broadcast on Twin Cities Public Television, just moments after her then boss, former Independence Party Gov. Jesse Ventura, gave a statewide address.
It could have been yesterday.
Malcolm is now leading the health department’s response to a new threat: the coronavirus pandemic. Her days are long, filled with press briefings and conference calls where she fields many of the same questions she did in 2001. Even now — as the death toll from the virus rises almost daily — Malcolm retains her frank, calm delivery, one that often veers into her wonky reservoir of knowledge.
“She’s wise, she’s sound in her thinking, she’s calm and she carries on,” said Penny Wheeler, president and CEO at Allina Health, where she worked with Malcolm. “If everybody could have a booster shot of Jan Malcolm right now, that would be OK.”
Her contemporaries have started calling her “Minnesota’s Dr. Fauci,” likening her to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has advised six administrations in public health crises. He has risen to new prominence for his matter-of-fact style in briefings on the coronavirus. Like Fauci, Malcolm has delivered the same pragmatic counsel under three administrations, regardless of their party affiliation.
“It’s a real shock to the system to get our heads around the magnitude of this challenge,” Malcolm said in an interview, during a short break between calls. “Everybody is just kind of reeling with, what does this mean? How big is this? How long is it going to last? And what kind of changes will be left in its wake?”
Growing up, Malcolm didn’t picture herself managing catastrophes. A Minnetonka High School graduate, Malcolm was pre-med at Dartmouth, an Ivy League college in Hanover, N.H. She was on track to be a physician when she decided to take a few elective classes on medical economics and the sociology of medicine. “It was for fun,” she said. “It opened my eyes to this whole realm of health policy.”
Out of college, Malcolm dived into health policy research and worked for health maintenance organizations (HMOs) before she was tapped by Ventura to lead his health department in 1999. Her appointment raised eyebrows, charged with regulating the very industries she used to represent.
But she adapted to the new role quickly, convincing a skeptical Ventura to raise taxes on cigarettes and launch a major anti-smoking ad campaign. She was dogged in highlighting Minnesota’s health disparities.
After Ventura, she led the Courage Center, a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities, and its eventual merger with Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute and Allina Health. But former Gov. Mark Dayton called her back in 2018, after a backlog of elder abuse complaints led health commissioner Ed Ehlinger to resign. Malcolm returned to her old job and eliminated the excess of complaints within eight months.
“She’s often the smartest person in the room, but you never feel like she’s making you feel like she’s the smartest person in the room,” said Emily Piper, who served as Dayton’s commissioner of human services.
At the time, Malcolm planned only to help for the remainder of Dayton’s term, but she continued on into Gov. Tim Walz’s administration when he took over in 2019. A year later, the coronavirus happened.
On daily press calls, Malcolm speaks directly after Walz and is tasked with the grim situation update: relaying the numbers of positive COVID-19 cases and confirmed deaths in Minnesota, numbers that keep rising.
To slow the spread of the virus, the administration has closed schools, bars and restaurants. Minnesotans were asked to stay home unless absolutely necessary. Malcolm’s department initially took heat for not disclosing the names of long-term care facilities where residents and caregivers had tested positive for COVID-19, a decision she reversed.
Walz’s team has been praised by some for decisive decisionmaking and criticized by others for the impact it’s had on the economy. Sen. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka, chairs a health and human services committee and is effusive in his praise for Malcolm. But he’s worried the administration’s executive orders have been applied unevenly, with businesses like small salons and golf courses ordered to close.
“The public health people by nature err on the side of caution; that’s how they are trained,” he said. “There is great need for caution, and there is great need for distancing, but I’m concerned they’re closing places that are perfectly safe.”
Colleagues say they’re on calls with Malcolm at 10 a.m. and then again at 10 p.m., constantly updating business leaders, schools and hospitals. The toll rarely weighs publicly on Malcolm, who lost her partner to cancer in January.
“She’s a shock absorber, and that takes a strong person,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “There are groups, there are organizations, there are different political persuasions and it’s all coming into one place, and that’s her.”
But the pandemic has cast its own uncertainty over her life. Public health crises are usually episodic, but then they’re over. Not this one.
Malcolm takes solace in looking ahead. The pandemic has emphasized frailties in society she hopes will sharpen people’s values on the other side. Amid uncertainty, the public health wonk often taps that simple advice she delivered long ago: Wash your hands, take control of the things you can.
After decades in the field, those little things are instinctual for her. When Vice President Mike Pence toured Minnesota mask-maker 3M in March, he reached toward Malcolm to shake her hand.
She offered her elbow instead."
"April 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/companies-turning-to-borrowing-billions-to-pad-cash-flow-during-coronavirus-disruption/569358362/,StarTribune,Minnesota companies turn to borrowing billions to pad cash flow during coronavirus disruption,"Best Buy has drawn $1.25 billion, the entirety of a five-year revolving loan. Graco has tapped half of a $500 million credit facility. And Sleep Number has drawn the remainder of a $450 million loan.
The moves by these Minnesota companies and others across the country help secure cash flow during an increasingly volatile economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
More than 300 companies have tapped revolving lines of credit since March 5, including 34 public companies since March 30, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. Those 34 companies had a credit capacity of $23.8 billion and have drawn down $15.3 billion.
It’s no wonder companies are taking action. With conditions changing daily, more each day also are withdrawing financial guidance for the year. They also are tightening expenses, some by laying off or furloughing workers, others by putting off capital expenditures, all with the goal of conserving cash.
Drawing on the credit lines helps toward that goal, for one because even companies that are healthy right now might not meet the covenants in their debt agreements if the economy continues to dive, said Tony Brausen, former chief financial officer of Mosaic Co. and an adjunct professor at St. Thomas’s Opus School of Business.
“The second would be if you are worried that the banks are just going to have frozen capital at the time you actually need it because the economy could be in such dire straits,” Brausen said.
Companies followed this same playbook, although in a more drawn-out time period, after the 2008 financial downturn. The credit draws helped contribute to the bank crisis.
Carlos Hernandez, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase’s investment banking business, recently told clients and colleagues that the economic shutdown caused by the pandemic could prompt the sort of brutal reckoning for corporate America that banks went through after the 2008 financial crisis, according to the New York Times.
Even if that does not prove to be the case, there is still a worry that cash would be harder to get if the economy is in a prolonged downturn when it was relatively easy to get over the last decade as interest rates declined.
Robert Albertson, chief strategist of the Financial Services Group at Piper Sandler & Co. in New York, said the draws on credit facilities so far have not seemed to stress the large banks. However, the eventual impact will depend on how long the economy is at a standstill. Albertson does see some emerging stresses in other categories, mainly in commercial real estate lending.
He said if he were running a company that had a revolver he would draw it down. “I’d draw it down for a while, you can always pay it back,” Albertson said.
Why not just keep more cash on the balance sheet? Brausen said many companies consider a revolving line of credit as part of their reserves, he calls the combination of cash and credit a “liquidity buffer.”
“Running with lean cash is fine, as long as you are comfortable with the rest of your liquidity buffer,” Brausen said. “There is nothing wrong with running that way, lean on cash, as long as you know you can get that cash when you need it.”
But in times like this, companies might want to change strategies.
David Callen, chief financial officer of Minneapolis-based Sleep Number, said a credit revolver is a regular part of Sleep Number’s financial structure and something they tap on a regular basis.
On March 17, though, the company made a deeper withdrawal of the $262 million remaining on a $450 million revolving credit facility.
“Pulling down the balance of the revolver just made sense given the disruption and uncertainty surrounding COVID-19,” Callen said.
Richfield-based Best Buy first accessed its five-year revolving loan until Feb. 1 and on March 19 tapped the entire $1.25 billion. It also suspended its share repurchase program as it adjusted to stay-at-home orders affecting retail companies.
On the same day in March, Minneapolis-based Graco borrowed $250 million, half of its available revolving credit line, “in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The proceeds from the borrowings will be available to be used for working capital, general corporate or other purposes.”
Earlier that week, Edina-based Regis Corp. had told its lenders it would access the remaining $183 million on a $295 million revolving credit facility.
While the billions borrowed in the past month is a huge amount, banks said they can handle it. Reforms after the 2008 financial crisis mean they have more liquidity and reserve requirements, with annual stress tests to make sure they are in compliance.
“The U.S. banking system is more robust and resilient than it was before the 2008 financial crisis, in large part due to significantly higher levels of capital and liquidity across the industry,” U.S. Bank said in a statement. “U.S. Bank has a strong balance sheet that is well capitalized and high levels of liquidity. We are ready to help our customers — consumers, small businesses and large businesses — during this difficult time.”
Albertson, of Piper Sandler, who works on banking mergers, points to data from the Federal Reserve that showed a huge jump in loans in the previous week, mainly commercial and industrial loans, but also a corresponding jump in deposits.
“It’s not natural loan demand. And its interesting they are getting more deposits than they are lending,” Albertson said.
It suggests that companies are setting aside the cash for now in deposit accounts. It is a relatively low-cost move for companies that are looking for a bit of assurance.
Tapping a credit line does come with some costs. Not every company is willing to take the additional interest expense at this time.
“You are paying an insurance premium to have that cash in the bank, Brausen explained. “The insurance premium is equal to the difference between the interest rate on what I’m paying on the debt and what I’m earning by putting it back in the bank, which is close to nothing.”
Not all companies are withdrawing their revolvers because other corporate actions are helping the liquidity buffer. Winnebago Industries, which has management offices in Eden Prairie, has a $193 million asset-based loan facility it could tap beyond the $123 million in cash it had when its second quarter ended Feb. 29.
Executives at Winnebago, which has temporarily suspended manufacturing operations, were asked on a quarterly conference call March 25 why the company hasn’t tapped its credit line.
“We’ve evaluated our position and feel that it’s prudent to not incur that additional cost of that financing at this time,” Bryan Hughes, Winnebago’s chief financial officer, said.
The risk, of course, is that the money won’t be available later on the same terms.
Craig Mueller — a managing director at Golden Valley-based Oak Ridge Financial, which does mergers and acquisitions advisory work for banks — said companies are probably willing to renegotiate their loan covenants and pay a higher fee to do so if the economy makes their finances out of compliance with some covenants.
“But that takes time and that’s going to be an issue to get someone to take time to focus on this,” he said."
"April 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-deaths-up-2-to-24-in-covid-19-pandemic/569380622/,StarTribune,"Fairview doctors face furloughs as deaths, hospital expenses rise","As the number of Minnesota deaths from COVID-19 grew to 24 on Saturday, the pandemic’s financial shock became clearer for hospitals as one of the state’s largest health systems asked some doctors to consider going on furlough.
Fairview Health Services said it has asked doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants in certain primary care clinics to volunteer to take a week of unpaid leave, starting as early as Monday.
The request is being made of caregivers in clinics that are seeing a reduced volume of patients, Fairview said, adding in a statement that “reductions are not being made on the front lines of COVID patient care.”
“We’ve moved quickly to slow the spread and preserve necessary equipment by moving a majority of our visits to virtual and postponing all elective and nonurgent procedures,” Fairview officials said in response to questions from the Star Tribune. “The result is not only a dramatic reduction in workloads … but also a dramatic reduction in revenues.”
Revenue hits have prompted a number of health systems and private medical groups over the past two weeks to curtail hours or furlough workers. Hospitals, in particular, are incurring extra costs to prepare for the pandemic while also feeling financial pain from the elimination of elective procedures.
Hospitals remain strong supporters of an order from Gov. Tim Walz to halt elective and nonessential procedures in order to preserve scarce medical supplies, Mary Krinkie, vice president for government relations at the Minnesota Hospital Association, told lawmakers late last week. But they’re taking a financial hit.
“Our hospitals right now in Minnesota are losing $31 million a day — $31 million a day — because of lost revenue from eliminating elective surgeries,” Krinkie said. “We made that decision because we had to keep as much personal protective equipment as possible, but this is causing enormous financial hardship for hospitals.”
The Minnesota Department of Health reported Saturday two more deaths linked to COVID-19, an increase that pushed the statewide death toll to 24 people in the global coronavirus emergency. The number of known COVID-19 cases increased from 789 to 865, according to the Health Department.
A total of 95 people currently require hospitalization, compared with 86 Friday, the Health Department said. Patients in intensive-care units stood at 42, compared with 40 Friday. And the number of Minnesota counties with known cases increased to 58, with the addition of McLeod and Polk counties.
COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus that surfaced late last year. Since the first case was reported in Minnesota on March 6, a total of 180 people have been hospitalized.
The pandemic is putting severe stresses health care workers in hospitals, even as revenue hits are prompting temporary closures for some clinic locations and reduced staff at others.
Last week, Minneapolis-based Fairview said it expected to reduce some staff work hours in response to revenue cuts. Fairview operates 10 hospitals, including the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis and 65 primary care clinics.
On Saturday, Fairview said reduced hours will apply to about 15% of workers across the health system, which uses the brand M Health Fairview. Word of voluntary furloughs for physicians only came by week’s end and fits with changes happening in health systems across the country, Fairview said.
Furloughing now does not mean physicians won’t be brought back immediately if needed, the health system said. As part of a broad restructuring where more care is being delayed or provided online, Fairview next week is temporarily stopping walk-in care at 17 clinics.
The period for requested one-week physician furloughs ends May 3. Those who take unpaid leave will still get benefits.
“We are deeply grateful to all of our employees for the heroic work they are doing during this unprecedented crisis,” James Hereford, the chief executive at Fairview, said in a statement.
“The changes we’re making now are needed to ensure the long-term health of our system, so it can serve the community throughout this crisis and beyond.”
Two private medical groups in the past week told the Star Tribune they had furloughed more than half of their staff due to the shutdown of elective procedures.
Duluth-based Essentia Health has placed 500 nonmedical employees on unpaid leave. Mayo Clinic reduced or temporarily suspended hours or projects for supplemental or contract workers.
The primary focus now for hospitals is preparing for the pandemic, but the financial impacts are an “important sub-story,” said Dr. Rahul Koranne, chief executive of the Minnesota Hospital Association.
“Hospitals are organizations like many other employers,” Koranne said during an interview in late March. “We’re all in this together, so the economic impacts that are being felt by all employers are being felt by hospitals and health systems as well.”
On Friday, the CDC recommended that people wear cloth face coverings in places like grocery stores and pharmacies where it’s difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart.
Kris Ehresmann, the state’s infectious disease director, said in a conference call with reporters Saturday that Minnesotans who want to follow that guidance should take care not to use N95 masks, which are in short supply and must be conserved for health care workers."
"April 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/keep-it-up-minnesota-covid-19-response-shows-promise/569384442/,StarTribune,Minnesota's COVID-19 response shows promise in helping to slow virus,"The death toll from COVID-19 jumped from four to more than 20 in the first week of Gov. Tim Walz’s stay-at-home order, but amid the loss and great public anxiety, there are signs of hope.
Declines in traffic and even crime mean that Minnesotans are taking social distancing obligations seriously, which bodes well because aggressive responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been credited with at least leveling death tolls in hard-hit cities such as Seattle and San Francisco. And at least one national COVID-19 forecaster has reduced its death estimates for Minnesota based on the state’s efforts.
“I think there’s enough there that I certainly am confident that the decisions that we’re making around social distancing are the right decisions,” Walz said.
Modeling by the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Health showed that ordering people to stay at home would delay a surge of coronavirus infections that cause COVID-19, buying time for hospitals to add staff, beds and equipment — particularly ventilators for people who can’t breathe due to their respiratory symptoms.
Minnesota has a history of compliance, based on a Federal Reserve paper analyzing the 1918 Spanish flu. Minneapolis shut down schools, churches and gathering places on Oct. 12, 1918, only six days after flu deaths started to spike, and kept its social distancing measures in place for 116 days. The city saw a lower-than-expected surge in deaths compared to others such as Philadelphia or even St. Paul, where a 35-day delay prompted a Nov. 3, 1918, St. Paul Pioneer Press editorial titled “In Heaven’s Name Do Something!”
It’s possible, though unstudied, that the Minnesota ethos lends itself to compliance, said Phyllis Moen, a U sociology professor.
“It does seem that ‘Minnesota Nice’ extends to staying 6 feet apart and to honoring directives that really matter,” she said.
Minnesota even achieved an A- grade last weekend on the Unacast COVID-19 response scorecard, which uses mobile device data to assess mobility in states and counties. The tracking found mobility levels in Minnesota dropped by half, and that nonessential trips dropped more than 70%.
Car traffic levels have been 34% to 55% lower every day since March 28, when the stay-at-home order took effect, compared to the same dates in 2019, according to the Minnesota Department of Transportation. Use of Metro Transit local buses has decreased by more than 50%.
Even recent influenza data suggests progress, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director, because flu hospitalizations and positive tests plummeted last week.
“Social distancing has made a very big difference for that disease,” she said.
The billion-dollar question is whether social distancing has made a difference against the coronavirus as well — literally so when considering that more than 320,000 Minnesotans have been put out of work amid the pandemic, with many filing for unemployment benefits that will exhaust the state’s trust fund for that purpose.
When Walz issued the two-week stay-at-home order, the goal was an 80% reduction in face-to-face contact and viral transmission.
Modeling by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation suggests this is working. Deaths so far haven’t been increasing in Minnesota at the expected exponential rate, prompting the institute to lower its forecasted COVID-19 deaths in the state from around 2,000 two weeks ago to 932.
“We’re seeing the impact of these measures and how early they are” put in place, said Ali Mokdad, chief strategy officer for population health at the University of Washington.
Walz said he will be looking this week for updated modeling from the Minnesota analysts — and any sign of infection or death numbers ebbing — before deciding whether to extend the stay-at-home order, which is scheduled to end April 10. The initial plan is to scale back to the lesser restrictions that had been in place for much of March — which would still include bar, dine-in restaurant and entertainment venue closures.
The state needs to use a science-based but “sustainable” strategy, Walz said, because public compliance with social distancing could wane.
“A lot of this depends on how well Minnesotans simply adhere to it without us telling them to — so that they’re not jeopardizing the gains that we’re making,” Walz said.
Mobile device data has limits in terms of assessing social distancing compliance.
The Unacast ratings favor urban areas and give lower grades to rural areas, such as Minnesota’s Pipestone County — which on March 31 received an F — where people travel farther for work and shopping. (Minnesota’s grade dropped to a C- that weekday.)
Descartes Labs compensates in its analysis by looking at changes in median distances traveled by mobile device users. It found that Minnesotans on March 19 reduced the distance of their travels by 74%, and Pipestone residents cut their distances by 68%.
This distance-based measurement can be fooled, though, if people are taking multiple short trips.
“You could travel around and around in a circle, and it wouldn’t count, since you don’t get farther away from where you started,” said Katie Anderson, a spokesperson for Descartes.
Even so, hospital leaders are hoping the indicators are true and that compliance with social distancing is at least delaying the surge in COVID-19 cases that is expected to consume all of their beds at some point.
Hospitals have made arrangements to add around 1,000 beds statewide in case of a surge — with Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul being converted entirely into a facility for COVID-19. State emergency management leaders have evaluated 14 sites as makeshift hospitals, if needed, for stable, non-COVID-19 patients.
Concern remains about adequate ventilators and stocks of personal protective equipment such as masks to protect caregivers so that they don’t get sick as well, said Cheryl Petersen-Kroeber, director of emergency preparedness for the state Health Department. “If we lose that workforce, we’re going to be in a bigger crisis.”
A new state web page lists existing supply levels, including 374,000 N95 masks in stock and 1,600 awaiting delivery, and 208,000 gloves in stock and 660,000 awaiting delivery.
The state’s access to more supplies is unclear, as Walz said it is competing against other states and the federal administration of President Donald Trump, whose recent use of the Defense Production Act has raised questions about whether some supplies of N95 masks from 3M in St. Paul will still be earmarked for local use.
Social distancing could make a crucial difference in allowing the state and its hospitals to stock up before any surge of COVID-19 cases, said Joe Kelly, state emergency management director.
“This goes back to the buying of time because that allows more time from order to delivery,” he said.
Health officials have concerns about worried Minnesotans going too far. The recognition that people can spread this coronavirus before they have symptoms has led some to wear masks in public, but state health leaders have worried about the unintended consequences of that trend.
Masks could create false security for Minnesotans to forget social distancing and gather in crowds. And while there might not be as much harm wearing bandannas or hand-sewn masks, officials worry that people will decide to wear professional masks that health care workers need.
“They really do need to be homemade masks — certainly not the medical-grade masks that are in such short supply,” said state Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm.
Another concern is a 60% decline in visits to M Health Fairview hospital emergency departments, even for urgent medical problems, due to infection fears.
One patient with a profusely bleeding arm and another with strokelike symptoms delayed coming to ERs for care they urgently needed, said Dr. David Milbrandt, an emergency department vice president at M Health Fairview.
“I get it,” he said. “I’m scared as well, but our patients really need to know that, if they have a critical medical need, we’re there for them.”"
"April 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/is-hydroxychloroquine-a-game-changer-we-can-hope/569421602/,StarTribune,Is hydroxychloroquine a 'game-changer?' We can hope.,"President Donald Trump needs to leave medical treatment and advice to the nation’s doctors. Wielding the bully pulpit as he did over the weekend to promote hydroxychloroquine as a breakthrough COVID-19 drug is premature and potentially harmful.
This is not a medication for Americans to take on their own or insist upon over all other drugs should they become ill with this mysterious new virus. Political pronouncements are not a substitute for medical expertise.
Sold under the name Plaquenil, hydroxychloroquine is in the spotlight because there is no medication approved through regular channels to treat COVID-19. Doctors are rifling through the existing pharmaceutical toolbox to find something that may help.
Hydroxychloroquine is one drug that’s under consideration. It’s been used since the 1950s to treat lupus and is also a malaria preventive. But it’s not the only candidate that may hold promise.
Remdesivir, an antiviral developed to treat Ebola, was used successfully to treat one of the first Americans infected with COVID-19. Losartan, a high blood pressure medication that may block the COVID-19 virus from entering human cells, could also have benefits.
At this point, it’s too soon to call any of these drugs a “game changer,” Dr. Tim Schacker of the University of Minnesota told an editorial writer in a recent interview.
Large clinical trials are underway here and elsewhere to determine what works best. That means doctors are providing cutting-edge treatments to those who become ill and swiftly analyzing results. This work is accelerated, but it’s not clear if one drug works or if it’s better than others.
The small studies of hydroxychloroquine that have been done so far are not a replacement for rigorous trials at academic medical centers like the U. That the results from this early, limited research on hydroxychloroquine are mixed underscores the need to scale-up scientific scrutiny.
One recent study involved 30 patients in China. The report, published by the Journal of Zhejiang University, was released last month. Hydroxychloroquine was given to patients who became ill with COVID-19. “Patients who got the medicine didn’t fight off the new coronavirus more often than those who did not get the medicine,” according to a Bloomberg story.
A different study done in France did report a benefit from treating an even smaller number of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, a drug that fights bacteria, not viruses. This study has proved controversial, with critics contending that the sickest patients were left out of the analysis (which would skew the results). And, that the statistical methods used to analyze the data were not the ones that would typically be used in this kind of study.
Trump’s promotion may have unfortunately inspired some Americans to try buying hydroxychloroquine without a doctor’s prescription. A recent story in the Dallas Morning News said some people are crossing the southern border to buy it.
This is not a drug to take outside a doctor’s supervision. Hydroxychloroquine has what is known as a “narrow therapeutic window,” meaning there’s not much room between helpful and harmful doses. In addition, it can cause potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormalities. This is not a new concern but one that should be front of mind with the drug’s use potentially expanding.
Sequestering the drug for COVID-19 treatment may also lead to shortages for patients who take it for lupus and other conditions, a point made in a recent Star Tribune letter to the editor.
We hope Trump is proven right about hydroxychloroquine. But the responsibility for determining which drug, if any, is game-changing treatment lies with the nation’s doctors and scientists. Let their work, not political wishful thinking, guide the battle against the coronavirus."
"April 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/as-misinformation-abounds-networks-should-turn-off-trump/569421582/,StarTribune,"As misinformation abounds, networks should turn off Trump","The president’s daily Coronavirus Task Force presentations have morphed into a beast that bears no resemblance to the informative crisis briefings they were originally intended to be. Once managed by a composed and eloquent Vice President Mike Pence, they are now the vehicle for the uninterrupted rambling and factually suspect musings of President Donald Trump.
Whenever other officials speak, as if by command, their first-spoken words typically are in praise of Trump’s decisive, bold, courageous leadership. If the crisis weren’t so serious, the scene would be comedy material.
It’s time for the major television news networks to abide by their own professional standards and cease live broadcasts of Trump’s briefings.
He has less of an interest in keeping the public informed or helping beleaguered cities than in ensuring the spotlight stays on him.
State governors who fail to properly acknowledge Trump’s decisive, bold, courageous leadership will risk being placed at the back of the line for federal assistance. Woe to the journalist who dares read back the president’s own words to him and ask for accountability.
“Sir, what do you say to Americans who are upset with you over the way you ... downplayed this crisis over the last couple of months?” CNN’s Jim Acosta asked on March 30. He listed a series of quotes from Trump, including: “We have it very much under control in this country. The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. It’s going to disappear. It’s like a miracle. It will disappear.”
Trump responded, “Instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question. And other than that, I’m going to go to somebody else.”
PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor asked Trump about a statement he made on Fox News suggesting New York might be exaggerating its need of 30,000 ventilators. Trump interrupted her question before she could finish. “Look, let me tell you something: Be nice,” he snapped. “Don’t be threatening.”
The networks keep airing these tantrum-filled briefings because Trump’s buffoonery is ratings gold. But the public should not confuse this with news. Airing it live, knowing Trump’s record for dishonesty, is professionally irresponsible.
He is using this free airtime to substitute for the campaign rallies he cannot attend in a time of social distancing. It’s up to the networks to deny him the live, unfiltered coverage he clearly desires but no longer deserves."
"April 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/walz-calls-for-a-united-state-of-the-state-amid-covid-19/569398332/,StarTribune,Walz calls for a 'united' state of the state amid COVID-19,"Gov. Tim Walz, speaking Sunday into a camera from his official residence in St. Paul, turned his second State of the State address into an impassioned call to arms to fight the spread of the novel corona­virus that has upturned Minnesotans’ lives and crippled the state’s economy.
Putting aside the normal policy agendas that have been consumed by the COVID-19 crisis, the governor exalted Minnesotans’ grit and generosity in the face of the threat, which has seen rising death tolls in the state and across the nation in recent weeks.
“Long hours of darkness are ahead,” Walz warned. But he added that Minnesotans are already uniting by staying at home to prevent the spread, supporting health care workers and being there for one another while staying apart.
“There’s no stopping the storm of COVID-19 from hitting Minnesota, but we are preparing for it,” Walz said.
Part pep talk, part hard reality check, Walz used the 12-minute address to implore Minnesotans to work together. “You are slowing the spread of this disease,” he said. “You are protecting your neighbors. You are giving hospitals time to prepare to care for the many who will fall ill. You are making a difference and you are certainly saving lives.”
Offering signs of hope, Walz said the state is building hospitals’ capacity to ensure as many Minnesotans as possible can get care, increasing testing to track the spread, adding ventilators and trying to find more personal protective equipment for first responders.
“Minnesota, the state of our state is strong,” Walz said. “The state of our state is resilient. The state of our state is united.”
Hours before his speech, the DFL governor announced he had asked President Donald Trump to issue a major disaster declaration. That would allow federal funding to the state, which Walz wants to use for crisis counseling, supplemental nutrition programs, medical assistance, funeral aid and other needs.
The governor livestreamed his address to the state from the basement foyer in the governor’s residence in St. Paul. He has self-quarantined in the residence after interacting with a member of his security detail who caught COVID-19. It was an unusual setting for a State of the State, but not unprecedented. Former Gov. Jesse Ventura once gave the speech from the residence rather than at the State Capitol.
Walz’s livestreamed talks have become a familiar sight in recent weeks. He has regularly presented information about steps his administration is taking to block the spread of the coronavirus.
On Sunday, he highlighted the work of small businesses that are making hand sanitizer and masks, as well as that of large corporations such as the Mayo Clinic, Medtronic and 3M, which are working on equipment and treatment. He shared stories of people in downtown Minneapolis banging pots and pans to cheer on health care workers returning from a shift, and of a state trooper in North Branch handing a speeding doctor a stack of face masks instead of a ticket.
Walz said the key thing Minnesotans can do to help is remain at home, which he said could reduce the threat of virus transmission by up to 80%.
“Staying home is the only vaccine we have right now,” Walz said.
The pandemic has altered the focus of the governor and state government. It is also dramatically changing the state’s financial position.
The governor and legislators headed into the 2020 legislative session anticipating Minnesota would have a $1.5 billion budget surplus. The Republican majority in the Senate had proposed using the dollars for tax breaks. The DFL-dominated House suggested expanding early education opportunities and child-care availability. Both sides are now reshaping those plans.
In mid-March, with the virus spreading, Walz presented a cautious spending plan that left about $1.2 billion unspent in anticipation of the financial demands of COVID-19. That money will likely be consumed by the response.
“We’re going to have a budget shortfall next year. … We need to tighten our belt,” Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said in a video he released hours before Walz spoke.
The tone of Gazelka’s video was a departure from the usual politics that surrounds a State of the State address.
“We’re going to do everything we can to help our governor succeed,” Gazelka said, adding that Senate Republicans will do their best to rally around the governor’s plans.
He laid out a few of his top priorities, which align with some of Walz’s goals. Gazelka said he wants to ensure first responders can use workers’ compensation if they get the coronavirus, and look for ways to jump-start the economy and ensure jobs come back.
DFL leadership in the House also urged people to come together after Walz’s address. House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, called Walz the “man for the moment.”
House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said the governor “struck the right tone.” He said Republicans urge “common sense and compassion” when it comes to balancing public health and the economy moving forward, allowing people who can to go back to work while still remaining safe.
Walz initially planned to give his State of the State on March 23 in the House Chambers at the Capitol, as he had done in 2019. Typically legislators and guests pack into the chamber to watch the speech. That plan was nixed after the governor was quarantined, the Legislature recessed and people were ordered to distance themselves from others."
"April 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/covid-19-bashes-minnesota-budget/569420352/,StarTribune,From surplus to 'tsunami': Pandemic dims bright forecast for Minnesota's budget,"A month ago, Minnesota leaders were debating how to use an anticipated $1.5 billion surplus. On Monday, they were facing a radically different picture of hiring freezes, potential deficits and plummeting revenue brought on by the COVID-19 crisis.
“We are waiting for a tsunami of revenue to not show up,” state economist Laura Kalambokidis warned a Senate working group Monday.
State budget officials said the coronavirus’ financial toll remains uncertain, but it is clear the $1.5 billion they anticipated in extra revenue is dwindling fast. During the February budget forecast, Minnesota’s economic consultant predicted 2.1% GDP growth this year.
Now the consultant, IHS Markit, projects GDP will drop 5.4% and that positive growth won’t pick up until the beginning of next year, Kalambokidis said.
As income falls, state government has instituted a hiring freeze on all noncritical positions, Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Myron Frans told the Senate COVID-19 Response Working Group. It will continue to hire for priority positions, such as corrections officers and direct care and treatment staff, he said.
There’s a “cruel irony” in how, when less money is coming into state coffers, there is a greater demand for state aid, Kalambokidis said. The unemployment insurance program, for example, has seen requests for help skyrocket.
The state will get more information on Friday about its tax collections, but the full picture of the drop in revenue won’t be known for a while.
Minnesota allowed businesses to delay sales tax payments for a month, so that income will fall. Kalambokidis said analysts are trying to figure out how much of the shortfall is because of the delay and how much is due to the slowing economy.
Some lawmakers offered comparisons to the Great Recession of a decade ago.
“Frankly, I think this is worse than that,” Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said. He argued one of the things Minnesota can do to “bend the curve” of lost revenue is to allow some workers, such as people working at golf courses or in landscaping, to resume work. Gazelka said Gov. Tim Walz is thinking about that as well.
Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, DFL-Woodbury, asked if a borrowing bill to fund construction projects, commonly referred to as a bonding bill, would help the state’s economy. Using bonding to put people to work when the interest rates are low is a good idea, Kalambokidis said, though she added a warning.
“It’s not free money. There is debt service on that, so given the changing and deteriorating budget situation, that has to be taken into consideration as well,” she said.
The Legislature has so far approved $551 million to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, and more aid is expected.
Frans said it’s possible the Walz administration could ask legislators in May or later to approve a supplemental finance bill that includes some spending cuts, but it’s too soon to tell. It depends on the updated revenue and economic forecast coming Friday and how much of the state’s reserves they need to use, he said.
The state needs to review agencies and programs funded by dedicated revenue streams that are taking a hit, such as the Minnesota Zoo, Legacy Amendment funds and the Highway Trust Fund, Frans said.
Federal aid also is a piece of the financial puzzle, he said.
Minnesota is expected to receive nearly $2.2 billion in federal government aid by April 24, Frans said. About $1.2 billion of that will be for the state government, with the rest passed through to cities and local governments. Federal dollars are intended to help cover COVID-19-related expenses, not to make up for lost revenue, Senate fiscal analyst Eric Nauman said. Congress, however, could change that.
Medical equipment, unemployment claims, information technology upgrades and small business loans have been among states’ top spending priorities, said Erica MacKellar, with the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Kalambokidis warned that the state’s economic consultant has said the $2 trillion federal coronavirus aid package might be better described as a “preservation package” than a stimulus.
“It just may not have as much of an impact and give as much of a boost to growth as we would hope,” Kalambokidis said.
Even after coronavirus cases in the U.S. drop to zero, she said, it could still take a while for businesses and consumers to begin spending in earnest."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-gutted-his-personnel-office-and-now-s-when-we-need-it-most/569441042/,StarTribune,Trump gutted his personnel office — and now's when we need it most,"President Donald Trump’s delayed response to the coronavirus pandemic has already cost the nation: He ignored early advice and warnings from experts inside his administration and from at least some members of Congress, wasting precious weeks in what is now a national and global race to save lives. It’s why so many Americans cringe when he takes the podium every day to deliver crisis response updates, and why so many Americans are relieved any time Trump momentarily defers to either of two of the physicians on his task force, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. It’s why we cringe again when there’s any report that the president might be “losing his patience” with either of them.
Their perseverance in attempting to manage the federal government’s coronavirus response — despite Trump’s intransigence — is reassuring. So, it’s not hard to imagine the gravity of a situation in which either of them, or any of their other dedicated colleagues, would be replaced if, for instance, they fall out of favor with Trump. But that’s a real risk: In a moment when the White House might need to quickly vet and appoint critically needed personnel, the Presidential Personnel Office, the department designed to perform exactly that function — which I ran during the last year of the Obama administration — has been gutted and turned into a vehicle for enforcing loyalty and carrying out vendettas.
Over the past few years, Trump has put a premium on having people at executive branch agencies who prioritize his personal political agenda over national interests. As a consequence, several federal agencies are without a deep bench of experts in leadership roles and, in the midst of the greatest public health crisis of our lifetimes, could require a swift infusion of additional talent. For example, the Department of Homeland Security is rife with vacancies. If the FEMA administrator were to become incapacitated or need to be replaced, there is no deputy administrator (acting or otherwise) currently on the job, and it’s unclear whether a vetted or competent official is ready to come off the bench.
Before the COVID-19 crisis, the widespread number of vacancies across the executive branch were well-known. Trump has tried to place the blame on Senate Democrats, but the reality is that he hasn’t bothered to put forward nominations for close to 150 key federal positions. He has said he doesn’t want to fill all the vacant positions and has admitted to preferring temporary, “acting” officials in senior roles, who aren’t subject to Senate confirmation, and therefore not vetted for the benefit of the public and less accountable to Congress. Because of rapid turnover in his administration, some individuals in key administration positions — like the FDA commissioner, who oversees efforts to bring new coronavirus tests and treatments to market — are new on the job.
This neglect is consistent with Trump’s governing approach, which sidelines and substitutes experts’ judgment for his own, and demands more subservience from executive branch agencies than is the norm. Indeed, he has demonstrated downright hostility toward expertise, whether it comes from senior diplomats, scientists, military commanders, meteorologists or statisticians. And contra the president’s assertions that he can fill positions quickly if needed, the executive branch is not well-positioned to make this happen.
The Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) has been reorganized to focus on rooting out dissenters in the administration rather than its core responsibilities of recruiting and appointing political officials to key positions. As a part of that effort, Trump empowered John McEntee — a former aide with no personnel experience who was fired from an earlier White House role for financial and tax issues that reportedly prevented him from obtaining a permanent security clearance.
With Trump’s backing, McEntee has moved quickly to exact retribution. At his introductory meeting with White House liaisons — the political appointees who serve as intermediaries between executive branch agencies and the PPO — he asked for lists of appointees believed to be anti-Trump. In February alone, the undersecretary of defense for policy, the deputy national security adviser and the acting director of national intelligence were all removed from their posts. More recently, the deputy assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS was transferred, and the director of the Office of Personnel Management resigned, reportedly due to poor treatment from McEntee. (Shocking developments considering DHS’s leading role in pandemic response and that agencies are frantically looking to OPM for guidance as they move toward teleworking.) PPO also added new political litmus tests to its hiring questionnaire, asking candidates to identify the part of Trump’s campaign message that most appealed to them. And McEntee replaced the office’s director of operations, who had served in every Republican Presidential Personnel Office since the Reagan administration, with a college senior.
As constituted today, the office is built for success if, as one administration official put it, success “is to purge Never Trumpers and reward loyalists.” The abrupt firing, last week, of the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, and the announcement that Trump intends to nominate a White House lawyer who defended him in the impeachment inquiry to serve as the inspector general overseeing the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus serve as cases in point. It’s a now-formalized and emboldened version of loyalty-policing that goes back to the beginning of the administration, a practice that stands dangerously in the way of ensuring competence and accountability at the highest levels of government.
PPO is principally responsible for identifying qualified candidates for senior positions, expeditiously vetting them to satisfy legal and ethical criteria, supporting their nomination process (if required) and then quickly executing appointments, a process which is notoriously cumbersome and arcane. It’s bad enough that it has been turned into a clearinghouse for evaluating sitting public servants’ personal fealty to the president. Now, its misguided and petty mandate could hamper the government’s response to the coronavirus, threatening lives.
There are two other major reasons for concern about the office’s inability to execute its proper, intended function.
First, the pandemic poses a threat to the continuity of operations of agencies across government. Should an agency head or other critical leader within, say, the Defense Department or the Department of Health and Human Services — which includes the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control — get sick or die, current circumstances demand PPO is prepared with a succession plan that names qualified candidates to elevate.
Second, pressure is building from Congress and the public to know what more government could have done in the early weeks of the pandemic, and they’ll want to know what lessons are to be learned for the next one. Whether a commission or task force is modeled after those created following the terrorist attacks on 9/11 or the Gulf oil spill, PPO will have a critical role to play advising the president, Members of Congress and senior career officials on the most prudent and effective options ahead.
For now, the deficiencies in PPO add to the array of decisions by the administration that, collectively, are contributing to Americans’ suffering — doing away with the senior level position on global health and pandemics at the White House; dramatically scaling back the Centers for Disease Control’s global health security initiative designed to fight epidemics abroad; rolling back regulations aimed at preventing infections from spreading in nursing homes; and, more recently, ignoring the CDC’s guidance not to co-mingle infected and healthy passengers flying home from quarantine.
Trump once said “I alone can fix” what ails Washington. But the president’s apparent belief that the way to do this is by haphazardly reducing head count is unsupported and a threat to the health and safety of Americans. Discussions about vacancies are no longer academic. To help stem the spread of this virus, and future ones, the approach to personnel policy needs to change so government agencies and their experts can focus on their jobs, and not on whether they remain in the president’s good graces."
"April 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-covid-19-toll-rises-but-predicted-impact-falls/569409042/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz weighs modified stay-at-home order as forecast improves,"Gov. Tim Walz hinted Monday that he plans to extend the current stay-at-home order to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Minnesota, but with a tailored approach that allows some businesses to resume normal operations.
While cases of COVID-19 continue to increase — with 30 deaths and 986 confirmed cases in the state so far — Walz said there are encouraging signs, including a confirmed case rate of around 17 per 100,000 people in Minnesota that is the lowest among all states.
“We’re not resting on those laurels,” the governor said. “We’re preparing for what will come — a surge to our hospitals, a burden on those emergency rooms, and the risk [of infection] to our neighbors.”
Walz acknowledged the risk of scaling back any COVID-19 mitigations that are working — especially with a presumed surge in cases in the weeks ahead that could overwhelm hospitals. The governor said he is conducting a “sector by sector” analysis of businesses that could reopen after the current stay-at-home order expires Friday without jeopardizing the state’s progress in limiting COVID-19 cases.
“Are there things that we can do that would keep it just as safe, would not add to the transmission rate, would not put at-risk populations at risk, and yet would allow some economic activity to continue on? That’s what I’m trying to strike the balance on,” Walz said.
The idea of a scaled-back order came Monday amid encouraging news for Minnesota, including progress by Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota in developing antibody tests that identify when people have recovered from COVID-19 and may no longer be at risk of contracting or spreading the virus. Mayo started this testing on Monday. Both institutions also secured funding on Monday to test a blood pressure drug as a possible treatment of COVID-19.
Forecasting by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also dropped the predicted COVID-19 death toll in Minnesota in the next four months from 932 to 625. The institute projected no dates on which the state’s hospitals would run out of ventilators — which are critical for keeping patients with severe COVID-19 cases breathing.
U.S. stock values soared Monday on hopes that case rates of COVID-19, though still increasing, were not rising at the exponential rate that would be expected at this stage of the pandemic. The economic pain of the pandemic and the stay-at-home strategies to limit its spread have showed in the 342,000 Minnesotans who have applied for unemployment benefits.
Health officials cautioned against overconfidence. Minnesota having the lowest COVID-19 case rate is partly a function of limited diagnostic testing by the state’s public health lab due to a supply shortage, though Walz said other states have low testing rates as well.
State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said she also is concerned that new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on wearing masks in public could create false security and less compliance with stay-at-home guidelines.
“We just want to keep reinforcing that people who are sick need to be staying at home and isolating,” she said, “not feeling like it’s safe to go out in the community just because they’re wearing a mask.”
Minnesota also has outbreaks of at least one COVID-19 case in 33 long-term care facilities — a particular concern because people who are older or have underlying health conditions are at highest risk of severe illness.
Pre-existing medical conditions have been found in 47.9% of confirmed COVID-19 cases with complete medical histories in their records. But among those hospitalized, the rate jumped to 76.8%.
Researching risk factors
The median age of the 30 Minnesotans who died from COVID-19 is 86. The state has detailed health data on 28 of those victims, and 27 had underlying health conditions such as diabetes.
State health epidemiologists are now reviewing COVID-19 cases to see what other characteristics predisposed people to have more severe symptoms or need hospitalizations, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director. Obesity might be a risk factor, for example.
A majority of Minnesota’s confirmed cases are among women, but that appears to be a result of the state lab’s limited testing that includes health care workers and long-term care residents, who are more likely to be women.
The state’s testing capacity expanded in the past week when labs at the University of Minnesota Medical Center and HCMC started testing on their own. Nearly 200 cases have been confirmed in the past three days alone.
On Monday, 115 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, and 57 were in intensive care. Among confirmed cases, 470 people have recovered and are no longer subject to isolation restrictions.
Initially, the majority of cases in Minnesota occurred in people with recent histories of travel to other nations or states in which the coronavirus had been spreading. Now, 34% of cases are due to unknown sources within their communities, meaning that the virus is spreading widely in the state.
Ehresmann said there have been a couple of instances in the state of large gatherings that helped spread infections within families, but no known “super-spreader” events like the choir practice in Washington state in which one asymptomatic person spread the coronavirus widely to others."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-covid-19-cases-over-1000-with-34-deaths-veterans-home/569440222/,StarTribune,Walz to tweak stay-at-home restrictions as Minnesota battles COVID-19,"Gov. Tim Walz is scheduled on Wednesday to announce a new “Minnesota way” of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic — a strategy that keeps what worked during the current two-week, stay-at-home order, but puts the state on track to remove some of the restrictions that contributed to job loss and economic pain.
“We have a chance, if we get this right, to avoid the worst of the things that you’ve seen happen in certain places,” said Walz, referencing outbreaks that overwhelmed hospitals in New York City and Italy.
A surge of COVID-19 cases is still expected in Minnesota, which reported four deaths and 83 new cases on Tuesday, hours before it received a disaster declaration from President Donald Trump that unlocks federal funds for emergency protection and recovery from the pandemic. But the governor said there is evidence that the current social distancing strategies have not only delayed the upcoming surge but diminished it.
Minnesota expected to see exponential growth in infections at this stage of the pandemic, a doubling of cases every couple of days, but that is happening only every eight days, said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner.
“That is the pace we have maintained according to our latest data,” she said. “That’s good news.”
Walz issued the stay-at-home order, which ends Friday, based on modeling by the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Health that was pessimistic in certain assumptions. The governor praised that modeling for predicting that the current social distancing would make a difference, but the reality of the outbreak has played out differently in Minnesota in some key ways.
The modeling assumed an average length of stay of 23 days in intensive care for patients with severe COVID-19 illnesses. The governor said the actual length of stay has been shorter and the death rate has been lower.
On the other hand, the corona­virus has proved more infectious than predicted, Walz said. The modeling was based on one infected Minnesotan spreading the coronavirus to 2.5 others.
One month after reporting its first case of COVID-19, Minnesota now has 1,069 confirmed cases and 34 deaths caused by the novel corona­virus that emerged in China in December.
The state also has more than 35 outbreaks of at least one COVID-19 illness among residents or workers in long-term care facilities. The state’s count did not yet include a case confirmed by the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs of a person at the state veterans home in Minneapolis.
Dire scenarios still possible
The nightmare scenario for Minnesota would be a surge of COVID-19 cases that exceeds the number of hospital intensive care beds and ventilators, which keep people with severe respiratory symptoms breathing. When patients need ventilators but the machines aren’t available, death risks increase 1.5 to 16.5 times depending on the patient’s age, according to the data modeling.
Walz and Malcolm cautioned that such dire scenarios remain possible, even though the estimated peak of COVID-19 cases in Minnesota has been pushed back into May or early June. The state leaders said they worried about complacency — especially with the Easter weekend coming and the temptation for large groups of families to gather and to potentially spread the corona­virus.
“We don’t want the large gatherings,” Walz said.
Walz earlier this week had requested the federal disaster declaration, which has been issued to more than 40 states because of the pandemic. The move allows Minnesota to be reimbursed by the federal government for activation of an emergency operations center, National Guard costs, law enforcement, mental health support and other measures.
Halting this outbreak has been tougher than anticipated, because health officials underestimated the ability of people to spread the virus before showing symptoms. Walz said he now supports the wearing of bandannas or homemade masks in public to avoid infecting others, and he said he wore one this week when he took his dog to a park.
One-third of Minnesota’s confirmed cases involved people with no known connections to other infected people, meaning the virus is spreading widely.
How many people have mild cases and are never tested is unclear, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director, but a group of U.S. epidemiologists is working on a standard case definition that people can use to determine if they might have had it. As many as 80% of infections produce only mild symptoms.
Mayo Clinic started conducting serological testing this week to find antibodies in people’s bloodstreams and verify that they have recovered from coronavirus infections. Such tests will be in limited supply for now, though, even with the University of Minnesota adding them soon as well.
Walz said he is still troubled by the lack of upfront molecular testing to diagnose when people first get sick, which he said has left the state “blind” to the course of the outbreak.
The state public health lab is now primarily testing nasal swab samples from long-term care facilities, because of the number of residents at risk of complications from infection. The state has guidelines on prioritizing testing of others but is leaving that to private labs, including Mayo and labs at the U and HCMC that started testing last week.
Other tools have emerged to track the outbreak, though.
The U’s Carlson School of Management on Tuesday unveiled one of the first nationwide trackers of hospital bed usage for COVID-19, with the goal of helping states to share information and support one another when cases surge.
Mayo’s Nference app identifies surges in COVID-19 in communities by dividing the number of positive test results by the total number of tests performed in those communities.
The health system originally used the app to decide where to commit its medical resources throughout southeastern Minnesota in response to the pandemic, but now it is working with the health department to identify and quickly respond to hot spots statewide.
“We’re starting to get a better picture of the true rate of infection within various counties in Minnesota,” said Dr. Andrew Badley, chair of Mayo’s COVID-19 research task force.
Walz withheld further details of his revised COVID-19 response plan until Wednesday but said his goal is to maintain safety while allowing more workers and businesses to resume activities that involve little person-to-person contact and little threat of virus transmission.
The governor is hopeful that the next phase won’t be as harmful to the economy — more than 350,000 Minnesotans have applied for unemployment benefits since March 15 — but cautioned that people will still need to be disciplined to prevent the spread of infection.
“This is working,” he said, “because people are basically complying and doing the things they need to. None of that would change.”"
"April 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/wisconsin-heads-to-polls-despite-virus-fears/569440272/,StarTribune,Wisconsin heads to polls despite virus fears,"HUDSON, WIS. – Brenda Drinken didn’t even consider not voting in Wisconsin’s primary on Tuesday, despite COVID-19 concerns that nearly postponed the election in a frenzied legal battle.
“There’s people putting their lives on the line every day,” Drinken said as she and her husband, Mike, waited to vote at the Hudson Fire Department. Their faces were covered by masks as they stood 6 feet apart from other voters on either side. “Like my daughter — she’s a nurse in Rice Lake. It’s our duty and right and privilege, and you can’t be afraid.”
Wisconsin’s primary election went ahead as scheduled Tuesday, after the state’s Supreme Court overruled Gov. Tony Evers’ last-minute order to postpone in-person voting in response to the widening coronavirus pandemic.
From Hudson to Sturgeon Bay, Superior to Kenosha to Madison to Milwaukee, Wisconsinites headed out, despite a stay-at-home order, to vote in the Democratic presidential primary, a bitterly contested state Supreme Court race and for thousands of local offices.
The political and legal chaos that preceded the state’s primary is a possible preview of the way that America’s COVID-19 crisis could roil the democratic process in this election year.
The jostling in Wisconsin highlighted a nationwide divide between the two political parties in their response to voting under adverse conditions, with Democrats seeking much broader access to voting by mail while Republicans push against it.
But in Hudson on Tuesday morning, things were proceeding calmly. Around 8:30 a.m., about two dozen people were queued up in a snaking line outside the Fire Department, which was chosen as a roomier alternative voting site to City Hall.
“Everyone I’ve dealt with has been very pleasant, and that’s really all I was hoping for,” said Alison Egger, a city employee helping run the election.
Orange traffic cones marked where to stand in order to maintain social distance in the voting line. Voters were let into the fire hall one at a time (couples like Brenda and Mike Drinken were allowed in together). Many, though not all, wore masks or other face covers.
City workers erected plexiglass sneeze guards to protect poll workers. About a dozen Wisconsin National Guard soldiers were on hand to help out, as many election volunteers opted not to show up this year.
“It’s worth the risk,” said Andrew Hetchler, a truck driver waiting in line with a blaze orange deer-hunting scarf wrapped around his nose and mouth. “I’m young and healthy. This is a small risk, and it’s worth taking.”
Hetchler’s main interest was to vote in the state Supreme Court race between incumbent Justice Daniel Kelly and challenger Jill Karofsky. Calling himself a strong Second Amendment supporter, Hetchler said he worried Karofsky would rule in favor of tougher gun laws. Kelly was appointed by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker.
The Supreme Court race in this Midwestern battleground state has been closely watched across the nation. Kelly could be the deciding vote in a voting rights case that could push 240,000 people off Wisconsin’s voter rolls ahead of November’s election.
By comparison, the presidential primary has receded in importance, even though Wisconsin is the only state still holding an election this month. With former Vice President Joe Biden now the presumed nominee, the Democratic race has quieted considerably. A Marquette University poll released last week found Biden with a wide lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who had easily carried the state in the 2016 Democratic primary.
In Superior, 3,300 absentee ballots had been returned by Tuesday out of 4,300 requested, far exceeding previous levels. Mayor Jim Paine said the city had been “aggressively” asking residents to vote early, and that their efforts were paying off. “Thankfully, a majority of the expected turnout has already voted,” he said.
Around 10 a.m. poll workers at City Hall wore masks and directed a slow trickle of voters through traffic cones meant to keep safe distance. Election official Melanie Sternberg said she was surprised to see things going smoothly. “The biggest difference is the people who aren’t here, “ she said.
While things were orderly in Superior and Hudson on Tuesday morning, there were reports of long lines in places like Milwaukee, where the normal 180 polling locations were reduced to just five.
Up until late last week, Evers, a Democrat, had resisted calls to postpone in-person voting. But he changed course late last week, calling a special legislative session and asking lawmakers to postpone the primary. Republicans who control the Legislature ignored his request. On Monday, Evers issued an executive order to postpone the primary until June 9 — a move he said just last week was probably outside his legal authority.
Hours later, the state Supreme Court voted 4-2 to block Evers’ order.
Evers had also sought to lengthen the window in which absentee ballots could be received to several weeks past the primary date. On Monday the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority ruled that all absentee ballots must be postmarked by Tuesday.
“It’s just a terrible mess, to say the least,” said Becky Eggen, the Hudson city clerk. Asked if she’s worried about the health risks for voters and poll workers, Eggen replied: “Absolutely. Absolutely.”
Jordyn Anderson, a University of Wisconsin-River Falls student waiting in line in Hudson, said she wanted to vote as an act of personal rebellion because she was raised in a religious faith that discouraged participation in elections."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-secretary-of-state-pushes-election-changes/569472892/,StarTribune,Minnesota secretary of state proposes election changes because of COVID-19,"Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon unveiled legislation Wednesday to expand mail-in voting and reduce in-person polling places during the coronavirus pandemic, which could stretch into the summer and fall elections.
Simon’s proposal, presented during a virtual meeting of the Minnesota House Subcommittee on Elections, would make “temporary, one-time” changes that would automatically send registered voters mail-in ballots and allow extra time for election administrators to process the votes. Simon said the changes would be in effect only during the peacetime state of emergency declared by Gov. Tim Walz and that witnesses would be required for voting in order to combat fraud.
Similar mail-in ballot initiatives have been resisted by Republicans at the state and national level, including in Wisconsin, where thousands of voters spent hours in line outside polling places Tuesday.
Simon framed his proposal as a public health measure meant to avoid what he described as Tuesday’s ­“disaster” in ­Minnesota’s neighboring state.
“After talking with elections professionals from all levels of government throughout the state, the goal became very clear to me: We need to minimize exposure at polling places and maximize voting by mail,” Simon said in a statement.
Simon’s plan would change the location of some polling places, many of which are in vulnerable locations such as senior care facilities. On Wednesday, Simon said about 43 polling places were centered in senior living high-rises, nursing homes and care facilities.
Under the proposal, Simon’s office also would accept candidate filings by e-mail, fax, or U.S. mail instead of in person. Ballot-access petitions could be submitted with digital signatures.
“I hope we can all rise to the moment,” Simon said. “People will look back at this time and wonder what we did to make things better — and whether we put others before ourselves and our own interests. Now we need to look to solutions that match the scope and scale of the problem.”
The battle over mail-in ballots came to a head this week in Wisconsin, where the Democratic governor’s order permitting voting by mail was blocked by a GOP majority on the state Supreme Court.
Simon’s proposal faced immediate opposition from state GOP lawmakers skeptical that Minnesota’s existing laws governing absentee voting were not already sufficient to safely administer this year’s elections.
Republicans in the House and Senate have voiced concerns that new election laws would clear the way for new opportunities for voter fraud.
“The way the bill sits today does allow for heavy electioneering, and that is something we want to avoid,” said state Rep. Jim Nash, R-Waconia. He instead proposed expanding the number of polling places to reduce the number of people congregating at one site.
“That is why we can’t support this, because it is going to provide for a lot of electioneering and it does open the door for election fraud.”
Simon wants to use Minnesota’s share of the $400 million in election-related funding approved for states by Congress as part of the $2.2 trillion relief package passed last month. Minnesota’s portion must be approved by the Legislature before Simon’s office can use the money.
Simon expressed concern that Minnesota could encounter a shortage of poll workers, many of whom skew older and therefore are more vulnerable to COVID-19.
He said the state relies on about 30,000 poll workers to staff polling places during statewide elections.
Roughly a quarter of all Minnesota voters voted by mail in 2018. Even if that rate doubled this year, Simon said, too many voters would be gathering at polling places across the state.
The secretary of state’s proposal has the backing of the Minnesota Association of County Officers, which warned Wednesday that current social-distancing guidelines would not be possible in many polling places statewide this fall.
“A strong portion of statewide polling places are located in facilities that may not be available if the pandemic is still limiting establishments, and a significant number of election judges statewide have expressed concerns about potential exposure to COVID-19 or fall into an at-risk category,” said Deborah Erickson, Crow Wing County’s administrative services director."

Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group, which runs the nation’s largest health insurance company, said this week it’s providing nearly $2 billion in various types of funding including claims payments to medical and behavioral care providers.
On Wednesday, Eagan-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, which is the largest carrier for state residents, said it’s accelerating about $80 million in payments for providers that hit certain cost and quality goals, saying the money previously was scheduled to arrive in the fall.
Hospitals and clinics across the country have been stressed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic, as they try to prepare while seeing revenue plunge due to bans on elective surgeries and procedures.
“This is coming at an enormous cost to our hospitals,” Mary Krinkie, vice president for government relations at the Minnesota Hospital Association said during a legislative hearing this month.
“It was a tough policy choice that we felt we had to make in order to conserve personal protective equipment,” Krinkie said. But she added: “We have to protect our health care workers or we’re going to lose this fight.”
Several insurers said they are trying to make it easier for health care providers to get paid.
Minnetonka-based Medica said in a statement Wednesday that it’s trying to reduce the administrative burden for physicians and facilities by suspending certain requirements for prior authorization and documentation. Premera Blue Cross, a health plan in the Pacific Northwest, said Wednesday it would provide up to $100 million in financial support in the form of advance payments of claims to medical, dental and behavioral health providers.
UnitedHealth Group said it’s also providing up to $125 million in small-business loans to clinical groups that partner with OptumHealth, the company division that provides health care directly to patients. Blue Cross said it has removed prior authorizations for COVID-19 and many other treatments, and advanced payments to health care providers for certain care innovations.
The Minnesota Hospital Association said hospitals across the state are losing about $31 million per day in net revenue due to a statewide order in late March that halted most nonemergency medical procedures. Hospitals have supported the order as a way to conserve medical supplies for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients.
Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services said Saturday that sharp revenue declines were prompting reduced hours for about 15% of all workers at the health system, including a request for some physicians to take furloughs.
Duluth-based Essentia Health said in a filing with bondholders this week that it expects a 20% to 40% drop in short-term revenue due to reductions in elective procedures and surgeries.
Earlier this week, Fitch Ratings lowered the outlook for St. Cloud-based CentraCare due to COVID-19 concerns. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the health system has cut capital spending for the current fiscal year by about $25 million.
A spokeswoman for CentraCare noted that Fitch held steady its bond rating for the health system. The capital spending cuts “included a broad range of projects from equipment to software to facility refurbishments,” CentraCare said in a statement.
Two private medical groups told the Star Tribune last week they had furloughed more than half their workers. Minneapolis-based Allina Health System said the patient census across 11 hospitals has dropped to just 40%, from a regional average of more than 75%, and surgical volumes are about 10% to 20% of normal.
For hospitals, financial stress from the shutdown of elective surgeries comes as large medical centers are investing to create spaces, add supplies and retrain staff for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients. Small hospitals in rural areas, meanwhile, are “pretty quiet right now,” Krinkie said during last week’s legislative hearing. She added that those medical centers might be called on to care for non-COVID patients.
Dr. Scott Jensen, R-Chaska, said during the hearing that he worried about the long-term viability of some rural hospitals.
“I think when we get on the other side of this crisis, I think a lot of those hospitals are going to have a hard time opening their doors ever again,” Jensen said."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/don-t-blame-scotus-for-wisconsin-election-mess/569489202/,StarTribune,Don't blame U.S. Supreme Court for Wisconsin election mess,"Wisconsin held its election Tuesday on schedule despite coronavirus, and Democrats are blaming the U.S. Supreme Court for endangering public health. That’s not what happened.
On Monday night the justices rightly reversed a district judge’s last-minute order that would have allowed Wisconsin ballots to be cast after the election was legally over. The confusing episode is a reminder that, even in a pandemic, steps as grave as rewriting voting rules should be up to elected representatives and not freelanced by judges.
Wisconsin planned to mitigate the coronavirus threat with a large increase in vote-by-mail so fewer people would need to leave their homes. The Democratic National Committee sued to force the delay of the election outright.
Last Thursday a federal judge denied that extreme request but said vote-by-mail needed to be extended. Instead of receiving ballots by April 7, he said, clerks needed to count any ballots received by April 13. After apparently realizing that this could distort the electoral process by allowing Tuesday’s reported results to influence votes, the judge issued another order banning the state elections board from reporting any results before April 13.
The Republican National Committee asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, and five justices agreed that the district judge was outside his authority. His remedy would “fundamentally alter the nature of the election by allowing voting for six additional days after the election,” they wrote in an unsigned opinion. By trying to muzzle election results, they added, “the District Court in essence enjoined non-parties to this lawsuit.”
The Supreme Court decision came an hour after the Wisconsin Supreme Court swatted aside Gov. Tony Evers’s effort to unilaterally postpone the election. Through March, Evers, a Democrat, had indicated the election should proceed and issued an executive order exempting polling places from his mass-gathering ban.
Yet liberal pressure built in recent days and on Monday Evers tried using his emergency powers to call off the next day’s voting. The state’s Supreme Court ruled 4-2 that he didn’t have that power — election law would need to be changed by the legislature (though in other states governors’ emergency powers are broader). And so voting went ahead, with long lines at socially distanced polling places and a surge in absentee ballots — more than a million compared to less than a quarter million in 2016.
More than a dozen states have postponed their spring primary elections because of the virus. Yet Wisconsin’s election is more consequential. A state Supreme Court seat and criminal-justice referendum are both contested. Postponing it by months could require altering the duration of elected officials’ terms.
Republicans in the legislature didn’t show interest in postponing the election, but neither did Evers until recently. If voters are disappointed, they can hold legislators accountable in November or boot Evers in 2022."
"April 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/duluth-s-essentia-health-begins-sterilizing-reusing-n95-masks-despite-3m-concerns/569484462/,StarTribune,"Duluth's Essentia Health begins sterilizing, reusing N95 masks, despite 3M concerns","DULUTH – Essentia Health surgeon Dr. Mark Scott was skeptical of the hospital’s plan to decontaminate and reuse the all-important N95 masks that are in short supply nationwide.
“I initially had quite a bit of concern after reading some of the concerns raised by 3M,” which recommends against any reuse of its masks, he said. “The fact is this has been studied, and we’ve shown after treatment the masks can still pass a fit test. That gave me a lot more confidence.”
Already more than 300 masks have been decontaminated for reuse at St. Mary’s Medical Center in Duluth, with dozens more sent into a room to be sterilized by UV light every day.
By decontaminating the single-use masks while there is a shortage, Essentia has quintupled its supply to ensure health care workers have the protection they need before an expected surge of COVID-19 patients hits Northeastern Minnesota. Of the state’s confirmed coronavirus cases, more than 25% are health care workers.
Essentia is using the same method the University of Nebraska Medical Center implemented last month that is starting to find use in hospitals around the country. Masks that can be reused are hung from clotheslines in a small room and bathed in UV light that is reflected off the walls, almost like a large-scale tanning bed.
“We’re making sure we have a mask that has good integrity for our staff,” said Carly Mathews, sterile processing manager at Essentia.
While the Nebraska method was effective for up to a dozen reuses “without any adverse effects to the masks,” Mathews said, Essentia decided to limit their process to five times per mask as a “middle ground we’re more comfortable with.”
The leading manufacturer of the N95, Maplewood-based 3M, has said it “does not recommend or support attempts to sanitize, disinfect, or sterilize” its masks but said it is working with other companies and experts to find a method it can back.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is allowing hospitals to make their own decisions on sterilizing masks as needed.
“We understand in times of crisis, this option may need to be considered when (mask) shortages exist,” the CDC’s guidance says.
Mathews said her team in Duluth picks up about 20 masks at a time three times a day, usually at the end of nurse shifts. The UV process is also in use at Essentia facilities in Fargo and Brainerd.
Scott said the dosage of UV light is more than enough to kill viral particles but not enough to deteriorate the filter material or affect the fit.
“If the supply chain issue is resolved, we would certainly go back to single-use,” he said, adding he’s “frustrated to read about the lack of any concerted federal response to this.”
For now, Scott said, the reuse plan is a necessary one.
“Taking these steps to avoid infection will avoid having people sidelined or even killed by this.”"
"April 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-hospital-grants-awarded-as-covid-19-spreads/569473642/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz extends Minnesota's stay-at-home order to May 4,"Gov. Tim Walz is extending a statewide stay-at-home order to May 4 to push the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic into the summer — and to buy time to allow hospitals to stock up on supplies and researchers to develop tests and treatments against the new coronavirus.
The existing two-week stay-at-home order has already put Minnesota on a trajectory for a lower rate of cases than states such as New York and Louisiana, where hospitals have struggled with a surge of severely ill patients, the governor said. Even so, projections suggest the state will either run short or barely have enough intensive care hospital beds, ventilators, masks and protective equipment for doctors and nurses to weather the expected caseload.
“It can all go sideways very quickly if we don’t continue,” Walz said in announcing his decision Wednesday.
His initial order already exempted from restrictions as many as 78% of jobs deemed to be in critical industries. The new order will expand that list and allow some workers to immediately return to jobs that don’t pose obvious risks of spreading the virus. Walz mentioned landscapers, for example, and said that he would be reviewing other businesses during the next month that also could reopen under certain conditions.
Walz said he extended the order based on guidance from federal health officials, the experience of other states that took early action and saw good results, and updated modeling by state and University of Minnesota researchers.
While the federal government recommended social distancing measures until May 1, Walz chose May 4 because it will fall on a Monday. He said he doubted that schools would reopen before the summer break, though it’s possible.
The pandemic has played out differently than expected in Minnesota since the corona­virus first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December and spread worldwide. Minnesota so far has 1,154 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 39 deaths.
People aren’t needing to be hospitalized for as long as initially predicted, which is good news because shorter stays mean more beds available for other patients and potentially fewer deaths. On the other hand, it now appears that an infected person on average spreads the coronavirus to four others, making it nearly twice as infectious as forecast.
National studies also have found that nearly one in five infected people have no symptoms, making them unwitting spreaders of the virus, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.
This new understanding produced new state modeling results. Walz’s initial decision last month rested on modeling suggesting that a stay-at-home order could reduce deaths in Minnesota by as much as a third — from 74,000 to about 50,000 — over the course of the pandemic. Now, the modeling predicts the state actions might cut the death toll in half or better — from about 50,000 if the state had done nothing at all, to a range of 6,000 to 20,000 deaths.
While state officials said they provided the death estimates for transparency, they stressed that the modeling is intended to determine whether social restrictions and policies will work — not to project a death toll.
“We’re not predicting a certain number of deaths will happen or won’t happen with these scenarios,” said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner. “It’s directional. It’s all about helping us understand which levers have the biggest impact. And what the model confirms … is that the biggest levers really are building up ICU capacity and isolating the most vulnerable.”
The state currently has 1,147 intensive care hospital beds in operation, but renovations and other steps by hospitals over the past month resulted in another 1,098 beds that could be converted to that purpose in 24 hours, according to the state’s COVID-19 information dashboard. Another 525 ICU beds could be readied in 72 hours. State modeling suggests that might be enough, depending on the severity of the peak outbreak.
Reacting to order
The Minnesota Hospital Association commended the extension for buying more time to prepare. Hospitals and other care facilities also received $50 million in state grants Wednesday to support those efforts.
The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce issued a statement indicating that it supports the state’s virus response but wants state income and property tax payments delayed to ease the financial pain.
Some critics of Walz’s closures expressed defiance.
“I’m not staying home,” tweeted state Rep. Mary Franson, R-Alexandria. Franson and other conservative activists in Minnesota have questioned the forecasting models.
Other Republicans were more measured, though they expressed concern about a pandemic and a state response that has resulted in more than 367,000 Minnesotans filing for unemployment benefits.
“It is welcome news some businesses can open up and safely resume work, even as the stay-at-home order is extended,” Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said in a statement.
Landscapers and lawn care service workers will be among the first to return to work.
“Nature doesn’t pause,” said Bob Kroth, part owner of Parkway Lawn Service in Minneapolis. “Everything has to be taken care of like a usual season. … We’re just thankful to be out there.” While the extended stay-at-home order will push back the peak of COVID-19 cases, Walz said it will take public adherence to the order as well as additional testing capacity and hospital resources to reduce the size of that spike. The governor said he is hopeful about rapid expansion of antibody testing — already available at Mayo Clinic and soon to be available at the University of Minnesota — to identify people who have already recovered from infection and are presumably immune.
But supplies for both diagnostic molecular testing and antibody testing remain limited. The state just received a federally purchased supply of 15 new Abbott rapid COVID-19 testing machines, but only enough chemical reagents to run about 120 tests with those machines, said Joanne Bartkus, director of the state’s public health lab.
A worst-case estimate suggested Minnesota could run out of masks and other personal protective equipment amid a summer surge in COVID-19 cases. Walz said the state had received a commitment from a company to send such supplies from China before the military in that country surrounded the facility to halt exports.
Supplies have come steadily from other sources, though, said Alice Roberts-Davis, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Administration, and she expects that to continue.
“We have been seeing supplies coming in from overseas,” she said. “We feel like we’re very well positioned.”
Walz thanked President Donald Trump for the disaster declaration that will allow Minnesota to be reimbursed for pandemic expenses, such as its use of the National Guard. However, he lamented confusing aspects of the federal response, including a strangle­hold over supplies that makes it hard for Minnesota to buy even from local manufacturers such as Medtronic and 3M.
The way some COVID-19 payments will be apportioned could also reward states that didn’t respond as aggressively and expand Medicaid to reduce the number of people lacking insurance, Walz said.
One positive: Minnesota was among the first to gain clearance for supplemental $600 federal payments to go to state residents who are unemployed. In some instances, the combined state and federal unemployment payouts could exceed what workers would have made on their jobs, said Steve Grove, commissioner of the state Department of Employment and Economic Development.
“Its an odd incentive structure … but at a time when we’re asking for Minnesotans to stay home, we’re grateful for that federal money,” he said, “and of course we’re going to get every penny of it to the Minnesotans who deserve it.”"

Many of us have had to take a few days to mourn the candidate, whoever it was, who inspired us; the candidate who we donated to and volunteered for; the candidate who we believed had the best chance at winning the presidency; the candidate who we believed would be the best president.
But now we must stand up and wipe our tears, because it’s time to fully and fiercely get behind former Vice President Joe Biden. We owe it to our country and our democracy. We owe it to the most vulnerable among us who will be most hurt by a second Trump term. Democrats, this is the most important election of our lifetime, and it is now time to begin the hard, but critical, work of unifying.
Especially due to the current COVID-19 crisis, this campaign is going to face many obstacles, and campaigning is going to look a lot different, but the importance of uniting as Democrats is more important than ever.
Sen. Bernie Sanders has now made official what has been obvious for several weeks now. Bernie was not my first choice, nor was he my second, for that matter. That said, I have tremendous respect and admiration for Bernie and his passionate commitment to social justice. Where other politicians are too often weather vanes, spinning in the wind of public opinion, Bernie was a compass. He never wavered from the issues that were the bases for his campaign — Medicare for All, free college, eliminating corporate welfare, requiring wealthy Americans to bear a greater share of the tax burden. Bernie deserves credit for making those issues part of our national political discussion and even though Bernie’s candidacy is now over, that discussion is not.
Social progress in America has always been incremental, a matter of baby steps. I hope that those who so ardently embraced Bernie’s vision of a different America will continue to work to make that vision a reality. I hope that they will not choose to sit out the next election because their favorite candidate is not on the ballot. Look around. Your country needs you. Now is not the time to give up.
Expanded mail-in voting is crucial
Kudos to Secretary of State Steve Simon for his proposal to expand mail-in voting and limit in-person polling places in Minnesota during the coronavirus pandemic (“Plan would send mail-in ballots to all Minn. voters,” April 9). Limiting in-person voting should be an extraordinary remedy, in place for only as long as necessary. But we live in extraordinary times, and the coronavirus does not care if you become infected by going to a crowded restaurant or going to a crowded polling place. Limiting large gatherings for any reason just makes sense for now.
The Republicans who oppose such measures say mail-in voting and absentee ballots will lead to voter fraud. One need look no further than Wisconsin to see the real reason Republicans oppose such common sense measures. The city of Milwaukee has around 300,000 registered voters and usually has 180 polling locations. For Tuesday’s voting, there were just five polling locations open in Milwaukee because many sites were consolidated due to a shortage of poll workers. Elderly people had to wait in line for hours to vote.
Who is going to be most affected by closing polling places in the state’s largest city? Republican opposition to mail-in voting in Wisconsin and Minnesota has nothing to do with preventing voter fraud and everything to do with voter suppression in urban and minority districts.
Over the last several years there have been concerted efforts to limit, confuse or even refuse the right to vote to certain individuals and groups. Many politicians have openly admitted these efforts were calculated to keep the other side’s likely voters away from the polls.
If we agree that the foundation of our nation is its democracy and that the right to vote is the most important part, the sacrament, of any democracy, then shouldn’t any willful effort to keep even one registered voter from voting be a crime against our very reason for being, a crime tantamount to treason? Is anything less patriotic?
We should no longer shrug off these efforts as just political gamesmanship.
Let’s not repeat old mistakes
As a retired family practice physician, I have been horrified to watch the unfolding coronavirus health crisis in our country. It is heartbreaking and infuriating. It is also teaching us many lessons. One of the most important coronavirus lessons is to listen to science. I have heard politicians state that “no one could have predicted this.” That is absolutely not true. Scientists have been talking about this for years. They have written books, published papers, given conferences and designed gaming exercises on how to prepare for this. Yet despite that we have been unprepared.
This is a cautionary tale for all scientists. It is not good enough to just do the science. It is not good enough to stay in your cubicle (or lab) and let politicians and corporations drive the agenda. Scientists need to be proactive and take value-based action. This is true for coronavirus, it is true for climate change, and it is true for water quality.
The Enbridge Line 3 pipeline is one of the areas that calls for value-based action. We know that the Line 3 pipeline is going to drive climate change. We know that there will be risk to the more than 200 water bodies this pipeline is going to cross. We know that toxic chemicals are used to dilute thick tar sands oil and then piped through our water. We know building the pipeline violates the treaty rights of native peoples. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency knows all this. I call on the MPCA to remember its own mission statement, which is to “protect and improve the environment and human health.” I call on the MPCA to be the agency of proactive, value-based scientists we need in these perilous times. Please, MPCA, follow the science and deny the permits.
Don’t talk density without transit
Once again, the Star Tribune ran an opinion piece on the Twin Cities Army Ammunitions Plant (“Arden Hills must embrace affordable housing,” counterpoint, April 6) that mistakes some issues, glosses over others and leaves out one of the most important. The city of Arden Hills has been working since 1994 to ensure that when the TCAAP property is developed, it is done in a manner consistent with a city plan that is affordable. The city has been listening to its citizens and looking out for their interests, which is what a city is supposed to do. The county, which spent tens of millions needlessly to first buy the property and then clean it, does not understand what an agreement is. But the most important issue missed in the piece is the lack of transportation planning in this area.
Transportation options in the northern suburbs are severely limited now. There is no current plan to support the growth that will result from the development of the TCAAP property. Putting low-income housing in an area without adequate services or transportation would be cruel. So, let’s broaden the discussion to include all of the issues necessary to properly develop this property."
"April 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-models-gov-walz-used-should-be-made-public/569519302/,StarTribune,The models Gov. Walz used should be made public,"Gov. Tim Walz has issued (and now extended) a widespread business shutdown order which has greatly impacted the lives of Minnesotans, causing more than 300,000 jobs to be lost, with attendant noneconomic damage.
This order was premised on results from a model which allegedly showed that up to 74,000 people could die from coronavirus disease in Minnesota. The model has not been released to the public. It needs to be, along with all updates and changes to the original model, including the computer code underlying the model.
Independent experts, and the public, need to understand the basis for such a drastic action as that taken by the governor, so that they can form their own conclusions as to its necessity and advance alternative proposals.
In addition, the governor presumably ordered studies of the potential economic damage and other harms from the shutdown order, so that he could appropriately balance the costs and benefits of potential actions. Those studies also should be released to the public, along with any information on alternative courses of action that were considered.
If no such studies were performed, the governor should explain why.
And the governor should be forthcoming about the basis for his decisions and should explain to Minnesotans his plans for the future.
On what criteria will he lift the shutdown completely?
If infection rates rise after a shutdown is lifted, will he again call for a shutdown of businesses?
How long does he believe the state can endure the consequences of the shutdown?
These and many other questions should be proactively addressed. The actions taken by the governor were unprecedented and have caused unprecedented damage.
Minnesotans are entitled to full transparency on why and how those decisions were made and how and why decisions will be made in the future."
"April 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/top-minnesota-gop-lawmaker-opposes-walz-s-stay-home-order-on-coronavirus/569520902/,StarTribune,Top Minnesota GOP lawmaker opposes Gov. Tim Walz's extended stay-at-home order on coronavirus,"The top-ranking Republican in the Minnesota Legislature on Thursday came out against Gov. Tim Walz’s decision to extend the state’s stay-at-home order amid mounting GOP pushback to the DFL governor’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
“I do not approve of the Governor’s unilateral decision to continue the order to shelter at home until May 4th,” Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka tweeted Thursday. “We have to get on with our lives.”
The tweet marked a shift in tone for the East Gull Lake Republican. While he previously expressed “grave concerns” about the original order, he has largely refrained from publicly criticizing the governor as they work together on COVID-19 response legislation. Just 24 hours earlier, Gazelka had called Walz’s move to allow more businesses to operate under the revised order “welcome news.”
Walz defended his decision to extend the order Thursday, saying it was based on data and guidance from health experts. He said the revised order, which allows about 80% of Minnesotans to continue to work, has been criticized by others as too lax. He also signaled this week that his team is looking at relaxing some business closures in stages.
“My heart breaks for the people who are worried for their economic well-being, but you can’t get frustrated, go on a hunch and throw caution to the wind and pretend like our neighbors’ lives are somehow disposable,” Walz said.
Gazelka’s statement comes amid growing pushback from state Republicans, who question the governor’s use of executive power and whether the actions meant to curb the fast spread of the virus are merited and worth the economic toll.
“It is past time to allow reopening of businesses that are clearly Covid-safe,” tweeted Sen. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka. “Many should have never been closed in the first place. Tragically some of those are gone for good. Unnecessary collateral damage in the Covid War.”
Sen. Andrew Mathews, R-Princeton, questioned why “major stores like Walmart” remain open while smaller companies that feel they can operate safely are closed, saying the “blanket order does not fit our largely rural state.”
“Let business owners do the planning,” he said. “If we wait for the state to micromanage each industry, many businesses will run out of time.”
Beyond the economic impacts, some Minnesota Republicans are questioning the model the state is using to project illness and death and, in some cases, the severity of the outbreak itself. In a second tweet Thursday, Gazelka noted that the state’s estimates plan for 5,000 ICU cases at the pandemic’s peak, a figure higher than New York, an epicenter of the outbreak, is seeing today. “We are ready for the surge now,” he wrote. “Why shut MN business down for a NY sized surge?”
Walz said while he hopes he is wrong about the need for beds in Minnesota, “all the data shows me I cannot risk that at this time.”
“I will certainly change course of action based on the facts, but the facts don’t support taking it off right now,” he said of the stay-at-home order. “No one else is doing that and no one else is suggesting we do that.”
Questions about the model have prompted calls for more transparency on the assumptions and data used for the state’s projections. House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, on Thursday urged state officials to make that information public.
“Every day legislators are fielding dozens of calls from families and business owners whose lives have been turned upside down as a result of decisions based on modeling data that has not yet been released to the public,” he said. “It would be helpful for Minnesotans to see for themselves the data informing the governor’s executive orders — not just a few summary slides.”
Minnesota Department of Health officials and University of Minnesota researchers plan to address some of those questions on Friday, as they provide a closer look at the model the state is using to project potential illness and death due to COVID-19. But criticism and public pressure to lift the order and address the economic impact of the order may grow louder when the Legislature resumes work on Tuesday.
Walz on Thursday applauded leaders in the politically divided Legislature for working collaboratively to address the crisis so far. He dismissed concerns that dissenting opinions could make those efforts more difficult, saying talks on what to include in the next response package have continued to be productive."
"April 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-challenge-for-biden-sanders-is-unity/569551662/,StarTribune,"The challenge for Biden, Sanders is unity","As U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders drops out of the presidential race, he leaves behind a Democratic Party reshaped by his two White House bids.
No candidate this year, or in modern campaigns past, has hammered the issue of the nation’s wealth inequality as vociferously and effectively as Sanders. He has attacked the barriers to health care, education and housing, raising the pitch of the debate to an unprecedented level.
The challenge now for the party’s presumptive nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, will be to embrace Sanders’ issues — and his followers — while hewing a more politically and financially pragmatic approach that’s palatable for most Americans.
The anxiety and insecurity of poverty that Sanders sought to address have been laid bare by the coronavirus shutdown of much of the country’s economy. In the weeks and months ahead, as we plunge deeper into recession, more people will struggle to pay their bills and access health care.
The presidential campaign, now solely between Biden and President Donald Trump, will be like no other. Trump’s mercurial behavior was already certain to make the race unpredictable. The pandemic and the nation’s economic implosion will make it triply so.
Biden will bring the empathy that Trump lacks. But, to succeed, Biden must build a big tent — and for that he needs Sanders and his followers. Conversely, for Sanders to succeed in his goals, now that he has left the big stage, he needs Biden.
He has no alternative. On the issues Sanders cares about, the nation has regressed under Trump, as the president has sought to undermine rather than improve upon President Barack Obama’s health care plan; increased the economic divide with tax cuts for the wealthy that drove the country deeper into debt while the economy was strong; and undermined national attempts to address climate change.
While Sanders’ purist progressive campaign was unfettered by the reality of the nation’s political map, Biden seems to recognize that the key to Electoral College victory will lie in centrist swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida. Biden doesn’t have the luxury, nor does he have the political inclination, to indulge in the same uncompromising approach.
The question will be whether Sanders can accept that. Whether he embraces Biden — only figuratively in these times of physical distancing — as he failed to do with Hillary Clinton four years ago. Whether he acknowledges the political reality that, while Biden might not be the senator’s perfect candidate, he at least cares about the same issues.
What Sanders does next, in the days and weeks and months to come, will help determine the fate of Biden’s presidential quest. While Sanders was never able to expand his base and increase turnout of young voters as he promised, he nonetheless has a large and loyal following. He must now marshal them behind Biden as he failed to do for Clinton.
To succeed in his goals, Sanders must convince his followers, from their perspective, to not let the perfect become the enemy of the good."
"April 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/sharing-covid-19-data-can-save-lives/569552872/,StarTribune,Sharing COVID-19 data can save lives,"Gov. Tim Walz made the right call with his decision to let first responders in Minnesota use COVID-19 data to help protect themselves and the public from the virus’s spread.
On Friday, in the latest round of virus-related moves, Walz issued an executive order that directs the state Health Department to give law enforcement agencies the addresses of those who have been infected.
First responders can use the information to better protect themselves and others during the pandemic. At the same time, they should handle the data carefully.
Earlier this month, the Minnesota Sheriffs’ Association, Chiefs of Police Association and the Police and Peace Officers Association wrote to Walz and Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm. Representing more than 300 police chiefs, 87 county sheriffs and about 10,400 officers, they asked the department to notify first responders of a positive COVID-19 test and the address for the infected person.
Andy Skoogman, executive director of the police chiefs association, told an editorial writer that officers are accustomed to handling sensitive information and will not use it inappropriately. The addresses of people who are still contagious — but not their names — will be given to dispatchers who will only relay the information to officers when they get calls to that address.
Skoogman said his organization surveyed Minnesota police and sheriffs last week. Of the 229 responses, agencies reported that about 15% had officers who had self-quarantined with COVID-19 symptoms. Exact numbers for first responders, including actual infections, were not available. But the St. Paul Police Department has said that two of its officers have been infected.
“We haven’t had the [infection] information or enough protective equipment — and we don’t get priority COVID testing,” Skoogman said. “Now having that information will put us in a better position to protect the public if we’re exposed and to protect ourselves.’’
Skoogman noted that about a dozen states, including Wisconsin, are already sharing COVID-19 infection information with first responders.
Understandably, privacy concerns have been raised. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Minnesota, for example, opposed the plan. A spokesperson called the law enforcement request “serious overreach and a major violation of our constitutional right to privacy.”
Walz and the Health Department faced a difficult decision while trying to balance the state’s strong privacy protections with the challenge first responders face. But the highly contagious coronavirus has created extraordinary conditions that justify the transparency. Following some public pressure, the state recently started identifying long-term care facilities in which COVID-19 cases had been identified.
Making information available to first responders falls in that same category of serving the public good. Privacy remains an important, legally supported value. However, during a pandemic those public health measures that can help slow the spread and save lives take priority."

Ruff had been serving in the post in an interim role since October, when his predecessor, Nuria Rivera-Vandermyde, left to take a job in Austin, Texas.
Ruff’s contract is still being finalized. The salary for the city coordinator position ranges from $175,043 to $212,864.
The city coordinator advises elected officials and manages seven departments, including human resources and finance.
In his time on the job, Ruff has advised city officials on the coronavirus response, the 911 system and the response to the fire that destroyed the Francis Drake Hotel, among other issues.
“No Minneapolis city coordinator has faced a challenge of this magnitude, and there’s no person better equipped to take on this role right now than Mark Ruff,” Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement.

The masks are among the most coveted kind of personal protective equipment for health workers treating victims of COVID-19.
3M charged that Performance Supply LLC, a company based in New Jersey, falsely claimed a business affiliation with the Minnesota-based corporation that is a global leader in respirator production.
The suit in federal district court in New York City alleges that Performance Supply tried to sell New York City $45 million worth of respirators. 3M has asked the court to order Performance Supply to stop its illegal activity.
“3M heard about Performance when New York City government officials reached out to us and let us know they’d received an offer for a large amount of respirators,” 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich said. “They reached out to us to check it out and we confirmed it was not from us, and the prices offered were exorbitant, 500-600% above list prices.”
The suit comes as the U.S. and the world scramble to overcome shortages of respirators. 3M recently tangled with President Donald Trump over his objection to 3M selling respirators to customers in foreign countries. At one point Trump appeared to accuse 3M of unfair pricing. 3M CEO Mike Roman pushed back hard, saying the company risked retaliation if it failed to honor international sales agreements. Roman called it “absurd” to suggest that the company was not doing as much as it could to help Americans. 3M stresses that it has not changed prices of respirators because of the COVID-19 crisis.
3M’s disagreements with the president have been settled with some international distribution continuing while 3M ships more respirators to the U.S. from foreign production facilities.
What remains critical is finding ways to protect doctors, nurses and other health care personnel dealing with patients who have a virus for which no vaccine exists.
The lawsuit says Performance Supply offered to sell New York City N95 respirators for more than $6 each. The masks typically sell for less than $1.50 each.
In a news release, Denise Rutherford, 3M’s senior vice president of corporate affairs, said “3M does not — and will not — tolerate price gouging, fraud, deception, or other activities that unlawfully exploit the demand for critical 3M products during a pandemic.”
Rutherford said 3M now works with law enforcement and technology companies to address fraudulent efforts to sell its masks.
Friday’s lawsuit “is the first price-gouging lawsuit connected with our work to fight fraud during the COVID-19 outbreak,” Ehrlich said. “We do expect to file more.”
Performance Supply officials could not be reached for comment."
"April 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mail-in-ballots-make-voter-fraud-easy/569551702/,StarTribune,Mail-in ballots make voter fraud easy,"The coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on America’s elections, as evidenced by the fight over Wisconsin’s primary this week.
One proposed solution is moving everyone to voting by mail, but President Donald Trump isn’t a fan. “A lot of people cheat with mail-in voting,” he said last week.
He’s got a point. I’ve done it myself.
In 2011, when I was living in Palm Beach County, Fla., I decided to test the system, and so I asked for three voter registration applications.
I filled them out, listing three different names — two that I pulled out of my head, Rebecca Bugle and Hannah Arendt, and my own name, Margaret Menge.
I listed my real date of birth, and made up dates of birth for the other two. On the lines where the application asked for a driver’s license number or last four of Social Security number, I wrote “none” as the instructions said to do if a person has neither of these.
A few weeks later I got two notices back, saying applications for Rebecca Bugle and Margaret Menge could not be processed because a driver’s license number or Social Security number was not provided.
But I also received in my mailbox a new voter information card for Hannah Arendt.
On the outside of the card, my mailman had circled the name and address and written a question mark in pencil. But he still put it in my mailbox.
A few days later, I checked the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections website and sure enough, there was Hannah Arendt, listed as an eligible voter — a person who existed in history, the celebrated author of “Eichmann in Jerusalem” — but not a person who was in existence in 2011 in Palm Beach County.
Not long after, with an election approaching, I called the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections, said I was Hannah Arendt, and asked for an absentee ballot. The employee on the phone asked for a date of birth, and when I gave her information on my initial application — July 20, 1991 — she said she’d send one.
The absentee ballot for Hannah Arendt appeared in my mailbox a week or two later.
I called a former Florida secretary of state in 2012 and asked him how was it possible that I was able to do this.
Well, he said, the fact is that they check names of people applying to register to vote against several different databases, but they have no way to check to see whether someone exists.
That’s just one way people can cheat with absentee ballots. There are many more.
Last year, a political operative working for North Carolina Republican congressional candidate Mark Harris was charged with fraud for directing a group of people to fill out as many as 1,000 absentee ballot requests on behalf of voters — most of whom were unaware the ballots were being requested.
These people then collected the ballots and filled them out themselves. Harris defeated Democrat Dan McCready by just 905 votes and, though it was never shown that the number of tainted ballots was enough to account for Harris’s win, the election results were thrown out and a new election was held. (Republican Dan Bishop beat McCready in a special election by 2,400 votes.)
Also in 2019, a Democratic city clerk in Southfield, Mich., was arrested and charged with six felonies for falsifying absentee ballot records to say that 193 of the ballots in one election were missing signatures or a return date, when in fact they had both. The correct records were found in the trash can in her office.
In the new $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, Congress awarded $400 million to states to support elections — specifically, to help pay for changes that need to be made to elections, including a shift to more voting by mail.
But J. Christian Adams of the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) says if states aren’t careful, they’ll be issuing “an open invitation to fraud.”
“There are two big problems with vote by mail,” Adams said. “Number one, are the sort of things we discovered in the Justice Department when I was there — of people voting the ballot for other people through undue influence. That’s the first one. The second one — the voter rolls are a mess.”
Adams’ organization has sued several states and counties for refusing to maintain accurate voter rolls, allowing the names of thousands of dead voters, felons and noncitizens to remain in the system. Messy voter rolls make election fraud much easier, Adams says.
PILF is currently suing Allegheny County, Pa., for allowing the same person to register to vote seven times.
“It’s the exact same name, the exact same date of birth,” Adams said, as well as the same address. But the city and state won’t remove the extra registrations.
“In a vote by mail scheme, they’ll mail seven ballots,” he said.
States, I’ve since discovered, have no access to any master list of American citizens. So they can check to see if “Hannah Arendt” is a felon, or if she passed away as they can access death records. But they have no way of checking to see whether an American citizen with that birth date exists. It’s an enormous hole in the ballot security system.
Eight years have passed, and I assumed that someone had taken “Hannah Arendt” off the rolls by now.
But sure enough, when I checked the county website a few days ago, she was still there — with a message that read: “We have been unable to verify that this is your correct address. Please confirm or update your address with our office or use this website’s ‘Change of Address’ feature before voting in the next election.”
I won’t be casting that fraudulent ballot. But I have to wonder: Will my vote in the next election be canceled out by somebody who did?"
"April 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/we-ll-bounce-back-faster-if-the-next-relief-bill-helps-keep-idled-workers-on-payrolls/569541942/,StarTribune,We'll bounce back faster if the next relief bill helps keep idled workers on payrolls,"The U.S. government’s first economic relief bill to cope with the coronavirus shutdown was a stopgap measure. With employment in a free fall and businesses shutting down across the country, Americans needed money in their pockets as fast as possible. Without the time to figure out the optimal policy, the government turned to an existing system that was in place and ready to go: unemployment insurance. Millions of newly unemployed Americans now use these benefits as an economic lifeline.
There were many problems with this approach — for example, the unemployment-insurance system has been swamped, which will delay the day when people start getting money. But the biggest problem is that allowing millions to lose their jobs, even if they get checks in the short term, sets the economy up for a depression after the shutdowns end.
Consider two workers. The first gets fired from her job because of shutdowns and lives on unemployment benefits for three months. Afterward, she has to look for a new job. That will take time and effort, delaying the day that she gets back to being productive. The uncertainty created by that job search will also make her less likely to spend money at stores or restaurants. That lack of spending will crimp demand, causing businesses to avoid hiring, which means higher unemployment, more difficult job searches for everyone, more uncertainty and even less consumer spending. Result: a recession or even a depression that lasts for years.
But consider the second worker, who keeps her job during shutdown. Instead of using unemployment insurance, her company pays her to stay home for a few months. When shutdowns end, she goes right back to work on Day 1. And the knowledge that she’ll be able to go back to work and keep her old paycheck makes her more likely to spend; that raises demand, meaning that other workers will also be able to get jobs right away and so on. Result: an economy that bounces back quickly.
It’s obviously in the country’s interest to make sure that there are as many workers of the second type as possible. Existing employer-employee relationships may be intangible but they’re highly valuable economic assets that need to be preserved. Unfortunately, these relationships are evaporating at an incredible rate; by some estimates, the unemployment rate is already about 13%, higher than it ever was in the Great Recession. Young workers are being hit especially hard.
That bleeding must be stanched. Now that the first stimulus has bought the government a couple weeks of breathing room, the next relief bill needs to come very soon, and it needs to focus overwhelmingly on payroll maintenance instead of income maintenance.
The first relief bill did have one big program dedicated to keeping people in their jobs — the Paycheck Protection Program. This consists of loans to small and medium-sized businesses which are forgiven — in other words, which turn from loans into grants — if the businesses keep workers on payroll. Fortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has expressed a willingness to scale the program up, and the Federal Reserve is helping facilitate the program by accepting the loans as collateral from banks. The Treasury Department has tweaked the program’s rules to force companies that use the loans to spend 75% of the money on payroll. That will make it much harder to abuse the system.
This is all very good, but it leaves out large employers. Americans may be wary of government handouts to big corporations, but conceptually there’s no difference between a Walmart employee and a server at a local independent restaurant when it comes to sustaining the economy. The first relief bill already established a program to lend hundreds of billions of dollars to large companies. It would be relatively easy to retroactively convert these into grants conditioned on payroll maintenance.
A second important change is to retroactively alter the emergency unemployment-insurance system to turn it into a payroll-maintenance program. Austria allows employers to temporarily cut its workers’ hours by as much as 90%, with the government making up the lost wages. The Department of Labor has already taken a step in this direction by allowing workers to claim some unemployment benefits if their hours are cut by up to 60%.
In the next relief bill, Congress should take this idea to its logical conclusion. Companies that don’t benefit from forgivable payroll-protection loans should get a small stipend from the government for keeping workers on staff even with zero hours. These workers would be able to collect unemployment benefits until their hours are restored. That would be closer to Denmark’s approach.
An even better approach would be for the government to make these programs retroactive, allowing employers to rehire recently fired workers and receive either a forgivable loan or a payroll-maintenance stipend. Recently severed economic relationships can be restored even as workers stay home and collect government checks.
The best outcome for the coronavirus shutdowns is for the economy to simply turn off and then turn back on again once the pandemic has passed, avoiding a protracted depression. Payroll maintenance is the best way to do that. From now on, this should be the government’s top priority."
"April 11, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mayo-clinic-cutting-pay-for-20-000-workers/569541522/,StarTribune,"Mayo Clinic cutting pay for more than 20,000 workers","Mayo Clinic is cutting pay for about one-third of its workers — more than 20,000 people — as the financial fallout of COVID-19 spreads to the state’s largest employer and one of the nation’s marquee medical centers.
Hospitals and clinics across the state have implemented furloughs and diminished clinic hours in recent weeks as they have halted elective surgeries and procedures to conserve supplies for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients. At Mayo Clinic, officials said the actions have slashed revenue by more than 50%.
Last month, the Rochester-based health system trimmed costs by reducing contract employees and pausing construction projects, but found it was still facing a projected loss of $3 billion by year-end. Despite the economic pain, Mayo Clinic’s chief executive said he supports steps being taken by the state to control the spread including the extension this week of a stay-at-home order.
“Our ability to flatten the curve of impact allows our health systems to be better prepared with emerging treatment protocols and ensures that we have the equipment and facilities available to treat patients when they need it,” Gianrico Farrugia, Mayo Clinic’s chief executive, said in a statement to the Star Tribune.
Mayo Clinic is Minnesota’s largest nonprofit group with hospitals and clinics across five states. Its systemwide workforce of nearly 70,000 includes more than 40,000 in Minnesota.
In March, an order from Gov. Tim Walz indefinitely postponed all nonessential or elective surgeries and procedures as a means of conserving needed medical supplies such as masks and gowns for health care workers.
At that point, Mayo anticipated delays in those surgeries for four to six weeks, thinking the peak in COVID-19 patients might come in late April or early May, said Jeff Bolton, the chief administrative officer at Mayo.
Now, models suggest the peak might not come until June or July, Bolton said, although he added, “Once you get beyond two weeks, there’s a huge variance in the predictability.”
Some procedures and surgeries that have been delayed are getting to the point where doctors must treat patients, Bolton said. So, the clinic faces a timing challenge of trying to get some of those cases done before the surge arrives.
“What we’re seeing now, and this is particularly true with cancer patients, what you could delay a couple of weeks now comes in as an urgent, emergent type surgery,” Bolton said. “The key will be to do them in this period of time when we have a lot of capacity, frankly.”
Mayo’s cost-cutting fits with an odd trend where many health care providers are trimming work hours just as the need for pandemic-related health care is acute.
Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services has said sharp revenue declines have prompted reduced hours for about 15% of all workers, including a request for some physicians to take furloughs.
Duluth-based Essentia Health said in a filing with bondholders this week that it expects a 20% to 40% drop in short-term revenue due to reductions in elective procedures and surgeries. Some private medical groups have furloughed more than half their workers.
Mayo said it’s seeing a revenue decline this month of about $150 million per week. The clinic previously announced that allied health staff would continue to be paid their current rate of pay through April 28, but mounting financial trouble forced the pay cuts announced Friday.
“It’s about a third of overall staff — and that’s physicians, administrative and allied health staff — that will have salary reductions,” said Bolton, the chief administrative officer. Moves announced Friday include some furloughs, but “we’re working through the details on that,” he said.
“The health care crisis is turning into a financial crisis outside Mayo Clinic, but we’re not immune to that,” Bolton said. Changes should be temporary, he said, with models suggesting a great deal of pent-up demand for medical care at the clinic during the fourth quarter.
“The executives will take a higher pay cut, pay reduction, and take it earlier,” Bolton said. “We are protecting hourly wage employees. ... They tend to be our lower-earning individuals, and the hardship would be much more significant.”
The public health emergency with COVID-19 means different things for different hospitals, Bolton said.
In New York City, there are so many patients sickened with the novel coronavirus that health care workers are contracting the disease, hospitals are short-staffed and they face severe shortages in supplies.
Those hospitals will face a financial crisis, too, Bolton predicted, because “the cost of treating a COVID patient and revenue associated with it is not going to be what you’d realize with a traditional surgical practice.”
In Minnesota, there’s a relatively low number of COVID-19 patients now, he said, but health care systems are struggling to obtain enough ventilators and personal protective equipment.
Near-term budget challenges won’t negatively affect the clinic’s push for new treatments and testing related to COVID-19, Bolton said. In terms of hospital operations, Mayo is trying to develop new ways to stretch the limited supply of protective equipment for health care workers, he said, with 3-D printing of masks and experiments to sterilize single-use items so they can be reused.
In his statement, Farrugia said the clinic “is focusing on rapidly developing the testing we need to get people back to work and customers back to stores safely. While the time to resume normal routines and patient care has not yet come, we are hopeful that our work and the global collaboration we see each day will allow us to do so soon.”"
"April 11, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/gov-walz-issues-executive-order-providing-covid-19-locations-to-first-responders/569553122/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz issues executive order providing COVID-19 locations to first responders,"Gov. Tim Walz issued an executive order Friday compelling the Minnesota Department of Health to share the location of COVID-19 infections with first responders.
The state’s three largest professional law enforcement associations — the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, the Minnesota Sheriffs’ Association and the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association — wrote to Walz and health Commissioner Jan Malcolm on April 3 asking for the data.
“First responders keep Minnesotans and their communities safe and help ensure that critical services continue to be provided — and it is imperative to protect their health and safety,” Walz’s office said.
The law enforcement coalition argued that the information will allow first responders to take precautions at addresses with infections and ration limited protective gear such as face masks and gloves. The move will prevent the spread of the virus among first responders and the public, they said.
“We are very pleased and relieved that the Governor has chosen to share this information with 911 dispatch centers across the state,” said Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association. “With the extremely scarce supply of personal protective equipment available, our first responders can now better prepare themselves for every call-for-service and use the protective equipment more wisely.”
Under Walz’s order, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) will share the addresses of COVID-19 infections that are still contagious with the Department of Public Safety (DPS), which will distribute the data to 911 dispatch centers. Dispatchers will share information with first responders called to one of the addresses.
The order goes into effect immediately and lasts the duration of the state of emergency declared by Walz.
The virus had infected 1,336 Minnesotans as of Friday and killed 57.
“This decision is not taken lightly,” said Walz’s Friday order. “…We must implement safeguards to ensure that no one abuses this data.”
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Minnesota has opposed sharing the data, noting that it won’t prevent infection because the count of positive cases is underrepresented due to a shortage of tests.
“The demand by law enforcement associations … is a serious overreach and a major violation of our constitutional right to privacy,” ACLU-Minnesota legal director Teresa Nelson previously said. “Providing a list to law enforcement that contains a clear undercount of COVID-19 cases would create a false sense of security, likely leading to more cases of coronavirus among our first responders.”
Skoogman noted that first responders already have access to other data protected under Minnesota law as private data.
“We are very aware of the privacy concerns and are extremely sensitive to them,” he said. “We’re also confident that public health leaders and public safety experts have developed a process that helps protect this information — nearly a dozen other states have done this since the COVID-19 crisis began. Minnesota can certainly do it, too.”
Walz’s office said there are “strict prohibitions” against sharing the information improperly.
The order laid out these guidelines, among others, for sharing the data:
• Only the addresses of people who test positive for COVID-19 and who remain contagious will be shared.
• The MDH must alert the DPS when a person is no longer contagious.
• The data “must remain confidential, be encrypted” when shared with the “minimum” number of first responders taking the call.
• The information must not be shared over channels of communication available to the public or “uninvolved parties.” If that cannot be avoided, dispatchers must use “coded language” or other methods to protect the data.
• First responders cannot use the information to refuse or delay a call.
• Anyone who violates state law protecting the data can be prosecuted for a misdemeanor.
Walz’s order said first responders must still take other steps to protect themselves at all calls, including observing distance from others and asking people about symptoms.
The governor’s announcement came after a morning conference call hosted by U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, a Republican representing Minnesota’s Eighth Congressional District, that featured several law enforcement leaders.
The speakers, who included Duluth Fire Chief Shawn Krizaj and St. Paul fire Capt. Chris Parsons, president of the Minnesota Professional Fire Fighters union, spoke urgently of a shortage of protective gear and the need for the addresses.
“This is a very important issue,” Parsons said, noting that medical calls make up 80% of St. Paul firefighters’ daily workload. “…I fear for the rural areas especially.”"
"April 11, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-deaths-up-7-to-57-in-covid-19-pandemic/569539732/,StarTribune,Minnesota officials unveil modeling behind state's COVID-19 strategy,"State health officials on Friday unveiled the thinking and data modeling behind their extended stay-at-home strategy to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused 64 deaths as of Saturday and 1,427 lab-confirmed infections in Minnesota.
With updated understanding of the coronavirus causing this pandemic, Minnesota researchers found two scenarios that would be achievable and cause the greatest reductions in deaths and pressure on hospitals. One modeled the impact of a plan that included an extended statewide order until May 8, while the other assessed restrictions only on people 60 and older — and others at greatest risk of severe cases — until July 10.
Both would halve the predicted number of deaths in Minnesota over the next year when compared to doing nothing at all to combat the virus, the modeling results showed. Gov. Tim Walz opted for the statewide extension — albeit until May 4 rather than the modeling date of May 8 — because it would push the peak of the outbreak to mid-July.
Both models assumed Minnesota would have 2,200 intensive care beds available, but the delay would give hospitals the chance to add more beds as well as ventilators, which could improve outcomes, said Stefan Gildemeister, state health economist.
“As that capacity goes up, mortality could shrink,” he said.
Worried about economy
Modeling by the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Health has generated immense interest in a public that is anxious about the COVID-19 pandemic but also about the economic impact of the shutdown that has caused more than 400,000 people to apply for state unemployment benefits.
Some have raised concerns about modeling in Minnesota that has predicted thousands of deaths over 365 days, when a widely cited model out of the University of Washington predicted 442 deaths in Minnesota and 60,000 in the U.S. — albeit only over 120 days.
Health officials stressed that the Minnesota modeling is designed to identify pandemic response strategies that work best — not to forecast death tolls. For transparency, though, they released the estimated death figures — which would be around 50,000 if the state had done nothing, and 22,000 (with a range of 9,000 to 36,000) under the model that most closely resembles the governor’s order.
“They are not about specific-point-in-time estimates,” state health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said of the models. “They are about directional changes.”
Assumptions changed
The latest death numbers were lower than the predictions that fueled Walz’s initial decision on a two-week, stay-at-home order. Gildemeister said the assumptions in the model have changed substantially due to the latest research on the coronavirus.
Length-of-stay in intensive care was originally set at 23 days, but was reduced in the latest modeling to 13 days based on U.S. experience in treating COVID-19. That alone means more estimated bed capacity for COVID-19 patients.
The researchers ran dozens of models under different scenarios, though Gildemeister said they focused on solutions that were likely in a democratic U.S. compared to stern measures in authoritarian countries such as China. The solutions that appeared most effective included the expansion of intensive care beds and restrictions on people at greatest risk.
Minnesota has 2,770 intensive care beds — including 525 that could be converted in 72 hours, according to the state COVID-19 dashboard. However, 844 ICU beds are currently in use, so the count of available beds is lower at the moment than the 2,200 included in the modeling.
Minnesota’s COVID-19 case count on Friday included outbreaks involving at least one staff member or resident of 55 congregate care facilities. Five of the seven newly reported deaths on Friday involved such residents, almost all of whom are older and have other medical problems. The median age of deaths in Minnesota is 87.
Weathering the pandemic
COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus that emerged in December in Wuhan, China. Nobody has immunity to it, and no proven vaccines or treatments exist.
Minnesota so far is weathering the pandemic about as well as any state, according to an analysis by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in Minnesota was 20.1 per 100,000 people on April 7, according to the CDC report.
Minnesota also had the lowest increase in its case rate since March 31, which state health officials have credited to public compliance with the state stay-at-home order.
A shortage of testing means that Minnesotans have unconfirmed infections, but all states have such shortages so this CDC comparison is reliable, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.
“Our testing, although not as widespread as we would like, is keeping pace with our neighbors,” she said. “So the lower rate is not a function of not testing.”
What happens after the extended stay-at-home order ends May 4 is unclear. The modeling that most closely resembled the governor’s order included an extension for four weeks for the entire state, but then lesser social distancing requirements for everyone through June 6, and stay-at-home restrictions that could continue for high-risk individuals into August.
Malcolm said the modeling is only one tool guiding the governor, whose first stay-at-home order exempted 78% of jobs deemed essential. Walz will be looking this month to allow more people to return to work under conditions that limit face-to-face contact and possible virus transmission.
‘Sure did help’
While business leaders trust the advice Walz is getting from the U and Mayo Clinic, the governor’s commitment to getting more businesses reopened was a key to maintaining their support for the extended order, said Charlie Weaver, executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership.
Companies are willing to comply with conditions such as checking worker temperatures at the door or maintaining social distancing in offices, he added.
“It wasn’t a quid pro quo,” Weaver said. “We might have supported it anyway. But it sure did help.”
The coronavirus is circulating faster than expected, partly because as many as 1 in 5 infected people have no symptoms and don’t know they are spreading it. The latest Minnesota modeling estimated that one infected person spread the virus to 3.9 others — compared to initial estimates of 2.2.
Gildemeister said the researchers will continue to challenge their assumptions about the coronavirus and the outbreak, which appears to be farther along in Minnesota than originally suggested. Even estimates about the effectiveness of social distancing need to be checked.
The modeling was based on an estimated 80% reduction in face-to-face contact and opportunities for virus transmission under the stay-at-home order. Gildemeister said surveys of Minnesotans are tallying their daily levels of contact with others to see if that 80% figure holds up.
“A model is as good as its inputs,” Gildemeister said, “and as more evidence emerges, our inputs will become better. We will learn more of the disease and, more importantly, we will learn more of the disease in Minnesota.”"

A statewide training session scheduled at Camp Ripley later this month would have featured simulated attacks of the sort that U.S. intelligence officials detected in 2016.
But COVID-19 has overwhelmed all of that. The training, like all large gatherings, is on hold.
Instead, election officials are steeling themselves for a possibly greater problem presented by the coronavirus itself, which already has forced the postponement of several presidential primaries and could severely hamper turnout in the fall general election.
The nation received a foreshadowing of that possibility last week in Wisconsin, where the virus prompted the closing of many polling places. Forced to choose between their personal safety and civic duty, many would-be voters stayed home. Others, wearing masks and doing their best to keep a safe distance from one another, waited in sometimes hourslong lines taking their chances to cast their ballots.
Eager to avoid more such scenes, Democrats in Minnesota and Washington, D.C. — led by U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar — have responded with calls to promote mail-in and early voting, measures that have run into resistance from President Donald Trump and many Republicans across the country, including lawmakers in St. Paul, who have raised questions about ballot integrity.
With local primary elections looming in Minnesota in August and national elections in November, the pandemic has raised the stakes in the long-running battle over ballot access and election security.
Klobuchar and fellow Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon unveiled federal legislation last month that would ensure early voting in all states, as well as voter access to mail-in and absentee ballots. Last week, the senators were joined by secretaries of state from both parties to call for more federal funding and quick action on voting by mail.
“We also have to think beyond the horror of the day, months ahead of us,” Klobuchar said Thursday. “And to do that we have to start planning now. We don’t know what the status of this virus will be in November, we don’t know what it will be in August.”
Advocacy groups such as the Brennan Center for Justice in New York argue that mail-in voting is already deeply entrenched in American politics. More than a quarter of ballots were cast by mail in 2018. Five states — Hawaii, Utah, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado — will hold all-mail elections this year. And in 28 states and the District of Columbia, voters have the right to request a mail ballot without excuse. Voting by mail is also the standard way for members of the armed services to participate in elections.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon proposed legislation last week that would temporarily move the state to mail-in balloting and shift polling locations away from vulnerable populations such as senior care facilities — measures backed by the Minnesota DFL.
“I think there is that danger if people perceive that they have to choose between their health and their right to vote, they’re probably going to choose health,” said Simon, a Democrat. “We think that’s a false choice, and we want to come up with a method of voting that doesn’t force anyone’’ to make that choice.
March primaries in Florida, Arizona and Illinois saw significant drops in in-person voting amid fears of the spreading virus. Wisconsin’s Supreme Court rejected Gov. Tony Evers’ order to postpone in-person voting.
The issue has only deepened partisan fissures.
Minnesota is poised to get up to $7 million out of $400 million Congress sent to states for election-related purposes as part of the $2 trillion aid package. Democrats and election security advocates say far more is needed to expand voting by mail and other early voting measures. However, Minnesota Republicans sharply opposed Simon’s proposals last week.
“Don’t be fooled folks,” Minnesota GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan wrote on Twitter. “This is an effort to steal our free and fair process to win elections.”
Trump, in an interview last month on Fox News, criticized mail-in and early voting provisions that Democrats had proposed in the federal aid package. “The things they had in there were crazy,” Trump said. “They had things — levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”
However, the GOP is not uniformly opposed to voting by mail. It’s long been the practice in Utah, a Republican-dominated state, and in recent days the GOP governor of Nebraska has supported it while the party in Pennsylvania has urged people to vote by mail.
Simon and his allies say time is running out to make needed changes ahead of the November election. He’s also concerned about turnout in Minnesota’s August primary for legislative and congressional seats.
A Pew Research Center poll last month found that about two-thirds of Americans say they would be uncomfortable going to a polling place during the virus outbreak. And a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 72% of all U.S. adults, including 79% of Democrats and 65% of Republicans, supported mail-in ballots as a way to protect voters against the pandemic.
A new bipartisan national task force on election security also recently urged election officials to immediately begin preparing for a crush of absentee voting requests, regardless of whether the pandemic’s spread slows.
Simon said that short of mailing ballots to every voter this year, the state might at least encourage voters to request mail-in ballots. But several influential state GOP lawmakers see little need to change the rules.
“I think mostly we’re just in a good place, period,” said state Sen. Mary Kiffmeyer, a Big Lake Republican who chairs the Senate’s finance, policy and elections committee. “We have a high voting population that is not easily deterred, and civic engagement and participation.”
Kiffmeyer, a former Minnesota secretary of state, argues that any measures to expand mail-in voting are premature given the “state of flux” during the pandemic.
Any new federal election security money must clear Kiffmeyer’s committee before the Legislature can approve its use by Simon’s office. A previous round of security money prompted a bitter fight that extended into the final hours of the 2019 session.
Absent legislative action, Gov. Tim Walz could order changes to the 2020 election in response to the corona­virus emergency. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, last month issued an executive order encouraging residents to vote absentee.
Either way, money will be needed for extra postage, envelope sorting and staffing if mail-in voting is expanded. Simon says he is also worried about a shortage of poll workers if the pandemic persists. He noted that election workers already have been dropping out of three upcoming special school district elections, a development he called the “canary in the coal mine.”
“These are pretty small-scale elections,” Simon said. “So if someone is afraid in what will probably be a pretty low-turnout election to show up and sit for 13 hours in a polling place, imagine the reticence or fear for a presidential general election in November with high turnout and high energy.”"
"April 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mask-appeal-may-grow-with-time/569595932/,StarTribune,Mask appeal may grow ... with time,"It has been about a week since the Trump administration recommended that all Americans wear masks, or some face coverings, in public to protect against the spread of coronavirus. But the president himself is still not following that advice.
As he put it, “Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I just don’t see it.”
Why doesn’t he “see it”? To answer that question, let’s ask another one. If you pass a neighbor on the street or in a grocery store, and if he’s wearing a mask, what do you think?
Here are some possibilities:
• He has coronavirus.
• He is far more frightened than he should be.
• He looks weird.
• He is being prudent.
• He is simply following the government’s recent recommendations.
All over the country, people who wear masks are still producing reactions 1, 2 or 3. To be sure, those reasons were more common a few weeks ago than they are now — but they continue to be widespread. Here’s the problem: If you know you’re going to produce one of the first three reactions, you’re less likely to wear a mask, even if it’s a sensible thing to do.
The more fundamental point is that even when they involve health and safety, our actions have “social meanings,” and acting on our own, none of us can change those meanings.
If you were a passenger who buckled your seat belt a few decades ago, the driver might have interpreted it this way: “You are a terrible driver, and I am terrified that we are going to crash.”
If you complained after someone lit up a cigarette in an office meeting in 1965, you would have been perceived as uncool or difficult or weird. You might even have felt you had to smoke, too, just to fit in.
If you declined to eat meat at a dinner party in, say, 2005, you might have seemed like a moralistic oddball — and in many places, that’s true today.
Social meanings greatly affect what we do. Sometimes they have the same effect as fines. If we violate existing norms, and if the meaning of what we do is generally regarded as bad, we will be punished. Sometimes social meanings have the same effect as subsidies. If we comply with existing norms, and if the meaning of what we do is generally regarded as good, we will be rewarded.
A recent example: Before the pandemic, you might have wanted to telecommute once in a while, and succeeded in getting your employer’s permission to do that. But if you thought the meaning of telecommuting was that you were showing yourself to be a slacker, and not really dedicated to your work, you might have felt pressure to go into the office.
Social meanings change over time — often slowly, but sometimes in a hurry. Because these changes usually affect how people behave or act, they might make all the difference: They can cost or save lives.
Social meanings often change because of law. If the law requires people to wear seat belts, the meaning of wearing seat belts suddenly becomes, “I do what the law says.” And when cigarette packages have prominent warnings, and people are banned from smoking in public places, it becomes perfectly acceptable to say: “Would you mind not smoking?”
Social meanings might also change because prominent people, or large numbers of people, are able to get them to shift. If a well — funded educational campaign emphasizes the dangers of drunken driving and the importance of having a “designated driver,” the meaning conveyed by turning down a drink can change pretty quickly.
We have seen massive changes in social meanings over the last many weeks. Declining to shake hands, working from home, washing your hands all the time — a lot of what was perceived as socially acceptable, even expected, behavior has been turned upside down.
Which brings us back to the choice of whether to wear a mask. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are “advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.” For the time being, it seems clear that people really should be wearing masks in public settings.
Whether people follow the CDC’s advice depends in large part on the social meaning of doing that. It would have shown real leadership if Trump had announced the recommendation while wearing a mask — or, at a minimum, by saying that he would personally follow the recommendation whenever in proximity to groups of (say) more than 10 people.
But whatever the president does, each of us can contribute to changing the meaning of wearing a mask, simply by doing as the CDC advised — and thus of increasing the likelihood that wearing some sort of face covering will be seen as what most people are doing these days to be good citizens, and to protect themselves and others.
Right now, we need the meaning of precautionary measures to be subsidized by new social meanings. Lives depend on it."
"April 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/politics-of-pandemic-response-emerge-in-minnesota-senate-race/569583612/,StarTribune,Politics of pandemic response emerge in Minnesota Senate race,"While Minnesota plunged into lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jason Lewis wasted no time disputing the breadth of the restrictions.
“Open Minnesota for business,” Lewis’ campaign declared on March 25, the same day that Gov. Tim Walz implemented a two-week stay-home order that’s since been extended to May 4.
Lewis instead urged a scaling back that would have allowed Minnesota businesses to reopen “for all but the most vulnerable residents” by April 1, and for schools to reopen by mid-April. In an interview last week, Lewis said he still believes that would be the better course.
Lewis, challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith in November, has increasingly staked his campaign on resistance to the pandemic response of Minnesota’s DFL leadership, foretelling what’s likely to be the dominant issue in races up and down the ballot in this pivotal election year.
The former talk show host and congressman is not the only Minnesota Republican to question whether the measures are worth the economic toll, but his position as GOP standard-bearer in the only statewide campaign this year is setting up a high-profile test of whether there’s a political upside to criticizing the strictest safety measures.
“You’ve got these small mom and pops — car dealerships, restaurants, coffee shops in areas, quite frankly remote areas, that have no signs of any outbreak that are suffering from this shutdown,” Lewis said. “I don’t think that’s going to help us fight the virus.”
Walz implemented the stay-home measures as a means of slowing the virus’ spread, so as not to overwhelm the state’s medical resources. Smith has echoed the arguments of the governor — and those of a host of public health officials — that abandoning the lockdowns could lead to a resurgence of infections and create greater economic damage.
“We shouldn’t be looking at this as a choice between our health and our economy,” said Smith, who was appointed to the Senate at the beginning of 2018 to serve out the term of former Sen. Al Franken. “Without our health, we’re going to not have a functioning economy.”
For her part, Smith’s focus in recent weeks, like most elected officials, has been on responding to the pandemic’s economic consequences.
On Feb. 15, she signed a letter from Senate Democrats expressing concern that Trump administration officials had not yet proposed any additional federal resources to combat the developing outbreak. She later pushed for resources for child-care providers to be included in the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package and pressed for the release of Minnesotans who were stranded on cruise ships.
Lewis said that, were he in Congress now, he would have voted in favor of the relief package, which the Senate passed unanimously at the end of March — “based on the premise that this is something that government did to small-businessmen and -women, and therefore had to do something to ease the pain,” he said.
Lewis has been using terms like “Chinese virus” in reference to COVID-19, echoing President Donald Trump and many conservative pundits. “I don’t support discrimination against anyone, but the origin of the virus is an epidemiological fact,” he said. The outbreak should motivate the U.S. government to vastly downscale its reliance on resources and goods produced in China, he said.
Smith said she, too, has concerns that some U.S. supply chains are overreliant on Chinese labor. But she said that “to link it with an ethnic group or nationality is just wrong, and a way of shifting blame.”
The University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, which rates election matchups around the country, has Minnesota’s race as “likely Democratic.” That tracks with Minnesota’s 12-year unbroken string of supporting Democrats in statewide races.
And Smith, by the end of last year, had more than seven times the campaign cash in the bank as Lewis. Fundraising totals for the first three months of this year are scheduled for release by April 15.
Lewis praises Trump’s handling of the viral pandemic and could benefit from the president’s efforts to put Minnesota in play in the presidential election. He said he hopes to benefit from GOP donors who see Minnesota as a pickup opportunity given imperiled Republican Senate incumbents in a handful of blue states.
“There’s this slate of Senate candidates who are going to be in the fight of their lives, so we better find some states we can flip,” Lewis said.
Any serious critique of government response to the pandemic can’t ignore the Trump administration’s role, Smith said.
“I’m angry they were so slow and ineffective in getting these tests deployed,” Smith said. “I think that’s really hurt us. And the mess in the medical supply chain is inexcusable.”
The coming weeks and months will start to show how both state and federal government actions to mitigate the coronavirus play out against the backdrop of the intensifying election cycle. While partisan fissures erupt over the science, Lewis sees voter sentiment shifting against lockdowns and other forms of government intervention.
“Politicians and pundits seem fixated on shelter-in-place policies and yet another ‘stimulus’ plan to save us,” he wrote in a March 25 opinion piece. “Sooner or later, freedom-loving Americans will rebel.”"
"April 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-readies-antibody-covid-19-response/569595692/,StarTribune,Minnesota readies antibody COVID-19 response,"The University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic are now offering antibody tests to find out who has recovered from COVID-19 — testing that Gov. Tim Walz views as critical to the state’s recovery from the ongoing pandemic.
Use of the U’s new test is expected to start this week at M Health Fairview’s Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul — with priority going to doctors, nurses and others in the facility that exclusively treats COVID-19 patients. Mayo in the past week has used antibody testing on 86 workers or patients.
Walz on Monday said he is challenging these institutions and others to dramatically ramp up in-state production of serological antibody testing, which could identify people who are no longer at risk of spreading or contracting the virus.
“We have to have an accurate way to understand who is infected currently and who has been infected,” Walz said.
COVID-19 has been lab-confirmed in 1,650 cases and has caused 70 deaths in Minnesota. Without sufficient testing, the state’s primary defense has been social distancing to reduce face-to-face contact and exposure risks — starting one month ago with Walz’s closure of dine-in restaurants, entertainment destinations and schools, and then the existing stay-at-home order.
Walz on Monday extended a peacetime emergency declaration until May 13 — giving him another month of administrative powers to take such steps. He also announced a state executive hiring freeze and 10% pay cuts for himself and his commissioners — the latest sign of the economic hardships amid the pandemic that include nearly 427,000 people applying for unemployment benefits.
Republican lawmakers continued to challenge the prolonged stay-at-home order, arguing that recent state data modeling projected an equivalent death toll and hospital surge if the restrictions were applied only to the elderly and high-risk groups.
“If we can begin the process of repairing our economy while still protecting those most vulnerable, we should have that conversation. Let’s let the numbers guide our work,” House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said.
The governor said his extension of the statewide stay-at-home order until May 4 was partly to buy time for hospitals to prepare, but also for the expansion of antibody and diagnostic testing in the next few weeks. Together with aggressive contact tracing and isolation of people who have been exposed to the virus, testing would allow the state to scale back and maintain restrictions on only those high-risk groups, he said.
“The problem is we are not ready … yet because we don’t have the testing in place,” he said.
Walz said the state needs to get to a point of 40,000 diagnostic tests per week, even though the state’s public and private labs have conducted only 38,000 of the tests of nasal or throat swabs so far. The serological tests are different in that they look after the fact for antibodies, the proteins produced by the human immune system to neutralize viruses.
Scientists don’t yet know if people can be reinfected by the coronavirus, but they believe based on studies from the 2002-03 SARS outbreak that people might have immunity for months or even years.
Whether the U and Mayo are in a position to produce enough antibody tests to meet the governor’s goal is unclear. The U’s lab should be able to make at least 100,000 tests. Mayo already has the capability to conduct 10,000 antibody tests per day and may soon double that capacity.
Public demand is expected to exceed capacity, in part because 80% of COVID-19 infections cause only mild symptoms — leaving many people in limbo wondering whether they were infected.
The U plans to make its antibody tests available for statewide surveillance and other uses, but for starters it is using them for health care workers who face daily exposure risks and could benefit from information about their COVID-19 status, said Dr. Jakub Tolar, the U’s vice president for clinical affairs and medical school dean.
“I need to protect my health care workers,” he said. “I need to figure out how to get this to them on the front line.”
Among Mayo’s 86 tests so far, 12 found antibodies in patients, suggesting they had recovered from COVID-19, said Elitza Theel, director of Mayo’s Clinical Microbiology Laboratory.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on April 1 issued emergency use approval for one type of antibody test by Cellex Inc., but Walz said he has concerns about the national demand for that test and the ability of the federal government to deliver a reliable quantity to Minnesota.
The federal government delivered 15 of Abbott Labs’ rapid diagnostic testing machines last week but only enough chemicals to perform 120 tests with them, he noted.
While most COVID-19 cases are mild, as many as 5% of infections cause severe respiratory symptoms that require intensive hospital care or ventilators to help patients breathe. Minnesota is projected to run short of ICU beds, but Walz said the stay-at-home order buys hospitals time to add more beds as well as tests.
The good news is that the U-derived antibody test really appears to work — as long as blood serum is drawn from patients well after their infections, said Marc Jenkins, director of the U’s Center for Immunology.
The test correctly produced negative results when applied to 200 samples of serum — the clear liquid left after red and white blood cells and clotting factors are removed — that were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. When applied to serum from 50 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the test found antibodies in all of the patients who had been infected at least 15 days.
The test was less accurate when looking at people within 10 days of infection, because it takes time for them to produce antibodies in measurable quantities, Jenkins said. But in each patient, the antibodies eventually emerged.
“We actually could observe them start to make antibodies,” Jenkins said. “That’s really remarkable evidence that the test is measuring what we want it to measure.”
Testing also is fairly fast — with results coming back in as little as four hours.
Theel said her lab only advises testing after 10 days of symptom onset or exposure to a COVID-19 case.
While the test has proved remarkably accurate, it isn’t foolproof, she said. “Importantly, some individuals, particularly those who are immunosuppressed, may never develop a detectable immune response.”"
"April 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-don-t-just-complain-about-government-transparency/569641392/,StarTribune,Counterpoint: Don't just complain about government transparency,"Often I read articles and opinion pieces or watch news reports in which someone is complaining about the government’s lack of transparency. Examples include recent reported comments from Sen. Paul Gazelka and an opinion piece by Kevin Roche (“The models Gov. Walz used should be made public,” April 10). Both involved the failure of state government, at that point, to affirmatively provide detailed data about the models being used to predict the future course of the coronavirus and how to deal with it.
As someone with expertise in the reality of how government does or does not make information and data available to the public, I always want to say to the commentator or opinion giver: “The government, except in very limited instances, has no legal duty on its own to affirmatively make government data available to anyone.” That legal reality dictates, in part, a major reason for the rationale that is the foundation of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.
If and when government chooses not to affirmatively provide data to the public, the Data Practices Act says that we citizens have the right to request public data and the government then becomes legally obligated to provide it.
What I saw missing in both the stories about Gazelka and the opinion piece by Roche was any attempt on their part to request the data that provides the basis for the COVID-19 modeling. I see this often in situations in which complaints are made about government’s failure to provide data.
By not asking for the data to which we are entitled, we sacrifice our ability to learn what our government is doing.
Real transparency is more than waiting for the government to hand out data to us. Real transparency involves demanding data from the government and fighting, if necessary, to force the government to provide it.
The Minnesota Coalition on Government Information, for which I am spokesperson, exists in large part to help the public understand their right to gain access to government data. We do this through education activities, recognizing those on the front line of data fights, working with the Legislature and sometimes litigating. These roles become even more critical in times like this in which much of government appears to want to carry out the public’s business with a scarcity of transparency and openness."
"April 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/ohio-florida-governors-are-a-coronavirus-opposites/569641402/,StarTribune,"Ohio, Florida governors are a coronavirus opposites","Ron DeSantis and Mike DeWine were elected in 2018 to govern swing states. Both are Republicans and have last names starting with “De.”
Their similarities end when it comes to how the governors of Florida and Ohio have managed the coronavirus in their states. Ohio’s DeWine has been resolute, decisive and serious. DeSantis has been meek, unsure and flippant. DeWine has led from the front; DeSantis from behind.
Floridians have noticed, and they’re not happy. While the post-pandemic popularity of many governors is soaring because of their responses — DeWine is up by 35 points — DeSantis is down by 7.
This isn’t just about polls. It’s also about public health outcomes. In one key category, Ohio has reported nearly 7,000 coronavirus cases, or 60 cases for every 100,000 people. Florida has reported more than 20,000 cases, a rate of about 100 cases for every 100,000 people.
A look back at the two governors’ responses might explain why Ohio appears to be doing better in controlling the spread of infection than Florida, or at least taking it more seriously.
Both declared a state of emergency on March 9, but what likely made a difference is what followed those declarations:
• Stay-at-home orders. DeWine issued an executive order effective March 24 for people to stay at home except for essential trips. DeSantis dawdled until April 3, relying on an ineffective patchwork of local government orders. Even then, DeSantis’ order has been confusing, not clarifying, with local officials in some cases unable to determine where and how it applies.
• School closings. DeWine ordered schools to shutter into April on March 12. DeSantis waited until March 17.
• Restaurants, bars and clubs. DeWine shut them all down on March 15, allowing restaurants to continue takeout and delivery. DeSantis wasn’t far behind, closing bars and clubs on March 17 but, once again, opted for half measures by allowing restaurants to stay open if they reduced seating capacity by 50%. A few days later, March 20, he ordered them all closed except for takeout and delivery.
• Gyms, fitness centers, movie theaters, bowling alleys. Ohio closed them on March 16. Florida waited until March 20, then only closed gyms and fitness centers.
• Barbershops, hair and nail salons. Ohio closed them on March 18; Florida on April 3.
• Elective surgeries and procedures. Ohio stopped them on March 17; Florida on March 20.
Some of the gaps were short, but every day matters in this emergency, something DeWine recognizes better than DeSantis.
Nothing is easy about the challenges faced by American governors.
But what we’re witnessing are governors like Mike DeWine who rise to the challenge, and governors like Ron DeSantis who, at least so far, seem ill-suited to leadership in a time of crisis. People look to their leaders during frightening times. Ohio’s governor is inspiring confidence; Florida’s is not."

The new partnership is expected to double 3M's current production of HEPA filters, which are used in 3M's hooded and battery-powered PAPRs.
The additional cartridge filters are needed as 3M's Valley, Neb., plant recently ramped up production of PAPRs to meet a surge in demand since the COVID-19 outbreak. The Nebraska plant, as well as one in South Dakota, also are increasing the number of N95 masks produced.
Cummins will make the new PAPR filters at its Neillsville, Wis., plant about 150 miles from Minneapolis on equipment typically used to manufacture diesel-engine filters.
The new Cummins partnership was announced on the same day Ford was to begin making up to 100,000 slightly different PAPR respirators in Michigan. Ford's new PAPR product was designed with 3M's help.
Rodney Hehenberger, 3M's respiratory global R&D leader, said his unit has never worked with Cummins. That changed during a University of Minnesota filtration conference last month when Hehenberger chatted with Cummins engineer Chris Holm about ways they might address COVID-19 together.
In three days, Hehenberger sent Holm 3M product drawings and 3M filter parts from Canada. By that Monday, Cummins was making filter prototypes in Wisconsin. The two firms now have a large team working together from Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Brockville, Ontario.
""It's been a bit of a whirlwind, and it hasn't really stopped,"" Hehenberger said."
"April 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/unitedhealth-profit-beats-forecasts-with-minimal-covid-19-impact/569655742/,StarTribune,"UnitedHealth talks rebates, payment plans as employers struggle with costs","As companies weather economic shocks from COVID-19, UnitedHealth Group says it's taking steps to shore-up the U.S. market for employer-sponsored health plans, the type of coverage that's the single most common source of health insurance in the country.
Executives at the Minnetonka-based health care giant told investors Wednesday they expect a shift in coverage from employer health plans to government-financed programs such as Medicaid, although they didn't forecast the magnitude of the change.
To stem the tide, the company's UnitedHealthcare division is granting payment plans to more customers. Executives also are considering premium rebates because health plans right now are saving so much money from the shutdown of elective surgeries to conserve supplies for COVID-19 patients.
For now, the savings are covering the cost of treating patients who are sickened in the pandemic, said David Wichmann, the chief executive at UnitedHealth Group.
""Employers are having to furlough employees. They have no revenues today,"" Wichmann said. ""They need and want to keep people in coverage.""
""It very well could be that under the circumstances, deferrals of services outweigh COVID-19 costs,"" Wichmann said, adding: ""We very well may find ourselves in a position where we could provide additional premium relief to those clients.""
First quarter results released Wednesday show UnitedHealth Group has absorbed little immediate damage thus far from the economic effects of the outbreak. The company also announced that one of its top executives, Andrew Witty, will temporarily leave the firm to help the World Health Organization develop a vaccine against the coronavirus.
UnitedHealth Group is Minnesota's largest company by revenue and employs 18,000 people in the state. UnitedHealth said it is paying full wages to its workforce of 325,000 people, and has boosted pay for front-line caregivers.
The company's UnitedHealthcare division is the nation's largest health insurer, with coverage for 43 million people.
The health insurance division has increased the share of customers being granted payment plans to better handle their monthly premiums, said Dirk McMahon, the chief executive at UnitedHealthcare. It's grown from less than 1% of the premium base in a typical month, McMahon said, to about 3% in April.
The insurer expects there could be a shift of membership from employer group plans to enrollment in state Medicaid programs, for people with low incomes. More people could turn to individual policies, as well, such as coverage sold under the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Citing financial losses a few years ago, UnitedHealthcare exited most of the government-run health exchanges where people buy ACA-compliant coverage. But on Wednesday, the company said it started considering a return to the health exchange market in more states even before COVID-19.
""With the current COVID crisis, we expect to be down for the year as businesses close and employers reduce payroll associated and driving group attrition,"" McMahon said. ""We do expect to see increases in Medicaid and our individual products to ultimately offset some of the losses we experience in the commercial group business.""
In addition to the health insurance business, UnitedHealth Group runs a collection of health care service companies called Optum, which includes a large network of clinics, surgery centers and urgent care facilities across 43 states.
The surgery centers have largely shut down with the delays in elective procedures, executives said Wednesday, but the division has expanded its use of ""telehealth"" technology so that caregivers and patients can communicate without meeting in clinics. Optum has cared for more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients, Wichmann said, while establishing more than 400 coronavirus testing sites across the country.
The COVID-19 crisis could inspire more physician groups to partner with the company, Wichman said, because ""it will remind a number of them about how important it is to align with certain partners with a strong financial standing.""
Optum runs a large IT and health care consulting business that's having trouble closing deals right now, executives said. Yet interest in Optum's services is growing, including from hospitals that are considering large outsourcing deals where the company takes over many back-office functions, said Witty, who is the chief executive at Optum.
Health care spending is being fundamentally altered by COVID-19, which impacts operations at UnitedHealthcare.
With the current halt in elective surgeries and procedures, the share of premium revenue spent on health care could be very low in the second quarter, said John Rex, the company's chief financial officer. But in the second half of the year, those surgeries and procedures could return in earnest, Rex said, with pent-up demand driving unusually high health care costs.
Yet there are many unknowns.
""Individuals with chronic conditions are among those for whom we have considerable concern in this environment,"" Rex said. ""While we are mitigating the impact through other means, mistreatments can aggravate health status, resulting in initially more intense care needs as the system reopens.""
Rex added: ""The impact of testing and coverage expansion, such as serologic tests — these are just a few of the factors we must consider.""
For the quarter ending March 31, the company saw a profit of $3.4 billion — off by about 3% from the same period last year — on revenue of $64.4 billion. On a per-share basis, earnings of $3.72 beat by 9 cents the profit expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
""It feels awkward to be talking about earnings outlooks at this moment,"" said Wichmann, the UnitedHealth Group chief executive. Maintaining the financial guidance is ""the most reasonable baseline posture in these uncertain times as we continue to grow and operate our businesses while assessing the multitude of potentially offsetting factors.""
Witty will spend the rest of the year co-leading the WHO effort, which is a partnership with other groups trying to speed vaccine development.
""We couldn't be more proud to see one of our own serve in this way,"" Wichmann said during a conference call with investors.
Before Witty joined the UnitedHealth Group board in 2017 and took the top position at Optum one year later, he was chief executive at the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline. During that time, Witty ""gained global recognition for his efforts to develop and expand access to critically needed vaccines,"" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement."
"April 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/u-s-sen-amy-klobuchar-trump-votes-by-mail-why-can-t-everyone/569661672/,StarTribune,U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Trump votes by mail. Why can't everyone?,"In a democracy, no one should be forced to choose between health and the right to vote.
Imagine if days before the November election you learn that your polling place has been closed, that your request for an absentee ballot has gone unfulfilled and that you have to risk a grave infection by standing in line — possibly for hours — to claim your stake in our democracy.
If that sounds outrageous to you, it should. But it’s exactly what happened in the Wisconsin election last week. First the Republican-controlled state legislature blocked Gov. Tony Evers’s efforts to delay the election for public safety reasons, and then the U.S. Supreme Court reversed his order to extend the absentee ballot deadline.
In Milwaukee, which has the largest minority population in the state, the number of open polling places was shrunk to five from 180, as poll workers dropped out. In Green Bay, the number plunged to two from 31. Needless to say, the lines were hours long. Voters wore homemade face masks to protect themselves from contracting the coronavirus — if they were willing to risk voting at all.
And if you think there ought to be a better way, you’re not alone. I know of one person who, with an election approaching in his newly adopted state, simply requested an absentee ballot from the comfort of his own home — so he could vote safely and easily by mail.
His name? Donald Trump. His address? 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. If it’s good enough for him, it’s good enough for all Americans.
I’m lead sponsor on a bill, with U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, that would require every state to allow its citizens to vote easily by mail. We are asking Congress to help states ramp this up in a big way, with funding for everything from workers to envelopes to postage.
My husband, John, just recovered from COVID-19. I know firsthand that it’s a brutal illness, even if, like him, you’re 52 and healthy — and for too many, it’s deadly. Public health officials have warned us that we simply don’t know how long it will last — or if there will be a second, third or fourth wave, once we reopen businesses and resume our lives. And many of those same experts will tell you that many Americans will still be at risk on Nov. 3, the date of the general election.
That is why we must reform our election systems, so that sheltering in place can also mean voting in place. And we must do it now, while we still have the time to preserve everyone’s ability to vote in November.
What we’re proposing is neither radical nor untried. About a quarter of voters already cast their ballots by mail. In fact, all states offer some form of it. Five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington — vote almost entirely by mail. And these are states that have elected Republicans and Democrats alike; there’s nothing partisan about full participation. At the same time, both Democratic and Republican governors and secretaries of state have recently taken actions to make voting by mail more accessible during this pandemic.
It’s troubling that many states still insist on making it hard to mail in a ballot. Sixteen states require voters to provide an excuse to obtain an absentee ballot (though several have lifted that requirement for their primary elections); six states also require more than one witness, or a notary, to validate a mail-in ballot. Imagine trying to drum up witnesses — much less a notary — in the thick of a public health crisis. We need to do away with the hurdles and the back flips once and for all.
In addition to providing reforms and necessary funding to states to ensure safe voting by mail, our legislation would require every state to offer at least 20 days of early voting at polling locations. This is so important in a pandemic because it shrinks the lines at the polls. It’s critical to those Americans who have disabilities, need language assistance or don’t have easy access to mailboxes even in the best of times.
Reform won’t come without a cost. We are pushing for ample funding to help states immediately prepare for mail voting, in addition to the $400 million Congress has already approved for that purpose, as well as for more early, in-person polling locations and protecting the health and safety of poll workers.
As we debate the next federal legislative relief package for COVID-19, here is what we know for sure: Failure to prepare for this pandemic has cost so much. Lives have been lost. Businesses large and small — representing lifetimes of hard work — now stand boarded up.
Yet there were so many signs it was coming.
November is coming, too. We need to make sure all of America doesn’t suffer what Wisconsin just did.
And if you want to know what it’s like to vote in a healthy, safe and secure way — from the comfort of your own home — just ask President Trump. He’s been doing it for years."

Tim Walz to halt rent, mortgage payments","To prevent “mass displacement” of struggling families and business closures, a coalition of local elected officials have asked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to suspend rent and mortgage payments and halt commercial property evictions amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Twenty-three elected officials — including a majority of the City Council members in Minneapolis and St. Paul — signed off on the request, which was sent to the governor earlier this month.
“Debt is piling up for renters and mortgage-holders, despite many not having a steady income for the foreseeable future,” the group wrote to the governor. “Mass displacement, home foreclosures, and the shuttering of businesses are imminent unless aggressive measures are taken immediately.”
They wrote that they feared the pandemic would exacerbate the housing crisis and be “felt most acutely by immigrant, Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities.”
“The recent temporary moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, and the expansion of unemployment insurance, are vital first steps in heading-off this looming financial devastation,” they wrote. “However, we are still far from making families whole, and preventing evictions and foreclosures down the line when families cannot repay the debt they are accruing.”
Walz issued an executive order last month halting residential evictions but noted that “Nothing in this Executive Order relieves a tenant’s obligation to pay rent.”
Walz spokesman Teddy Tschann said earlier this month that the governor has asked the Legislature for an increase to the Family Homeless Prevention and Assistance Program to help people cover rent and mortgage payments. But there’s no deal yet.
“Although the moratorium did not change tenants’ obligation to pay rent, this is a difficult time with potential financial implications for tenants, homeowners, and landlords,” Tschann said.
Both Minneapolis and St. Paul are setting aside money for rental assistance but acknowledge the demand is likely to outpace the supply.
Minneapolis City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who helped organize the letter-writing effort, said he supports the rental assistance efforts but fears it won’t be enough.
“I think the real question is at what point are state and local governments not going to have the money,” Ellison said in an interview earlier this month.
He added later: “Some folks have no money coming in. It’s not really a question of should the rent get paid or should the mortgage get paid. At some point, it’s not going to get paid.”"
"April 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/d-j-tice-is-the-anti-viral-economic-medicine-we-re-taking-safe/569709032/,StarTribune,Is the anti-viral economic medicine we're taking safe?,"Toward the end of Gov. Tim Walz’s April 9 press briefing on the state’s COVID-19 pandemic response, the 24-year National Guard veteran drew on his experiences fighting floodwaters to deflect skepticism about his four-week extension of the stay-at-home lockdown of Minnesota’s economy.
Walz noted that it’s nothing new to erect costly defenses against looming threats, even when we must base our actions on uncertain predictions about the scale of the danger.
“We’ve done this before,” the governor said. “I have been activated and have filled sandbags for weeks that never, ever got wet. They never got wet. We wasted a ton of time and a ton of money. But all of the modeling on the flooding showed us it was going to happen and it made sense to do it … .”
The governor’s reliance on this analogy goes to the heart of what, at bottom, some doubters find unsettling about the economic havoc Walz and other political leaders continue to believe America must inflict on itself in an effort to hold back the coronavirus tide.
The “ton of time” and “ton of money” invested in filling surplus sandbags somehow doesn’t quite seem equivalent to decisions that have set off a staggering economic collapse of unknown but perhaps unprecedented depth.
State officials reported this week that the ranks of unemployment insurance claimants in Minnesota soared nearly sevenfold in just the last month, with about 15% of state workers being idled more or less at once. Latest national estimates project the annualized rate of contraction in economic output at an unheard of 40% between April and June. We’ve achieved “easily the worst stretch of U.S. job losses on record,” according to news reports Thursday.
That’s a whole lot of sandbagging.
Walz, along with Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm and her team of researchers, have taken pains in recent weeks to explain the epidemiological models they have used to project COVID-19 cases and outcomes. Skeptics have questioned the conflicts between Minnesota’s projections and those of other models — along with a steady stream of downward adjustments to the death projections.
The questions are legitimate. The answers, meanwhile, have been illuminating and candid. And the bottom line simply seems to be, as Walz might say, that projecting an epidemic, like projecting a flood crest, is an uncertain affair. It makes sense not to be overly optimistic.
But what hasn’t been much discussed, or much in evidence, is the inquiry and examination Walz and other governors have been using to forecast the cascading economic harm that will eventually be done by shuttering many thousands of businesses and throwing many millions out of work, depending on how long it all lasts. Economic projections are difficult, too, but Walz and the other policymakers seem content to lament the economic pain all around them, and to express their longing for the earliest possible return to normal.
Such noble emotions don’t give much more assurance of a painstaking analysis than a phrase like “ton of money” does. Sympathetic feelings may not produce the kind of rigorous calculation we need as to when the public welfare damage from self-administered economic paralysis will begin to exceed the public welfare gains we can achieve in reducing sickness and premature death.
In short, what we need is a cost-benefit analysis — a determination of when the benefits of an intervention cease to outweigh the harms of its unintended but unavoidable costs or side effects. To determine that, those costs and side effects have to be discussed and examined as carefully as the hoped for benefits of social distancing.
Always controversial and uncomfortable when life-or-death issues are involved, cost-benefit evaluations have become standard in many regulatory processes. Rulemakers are often required to show that a particular safety requirement or pollution standard is worthwhile — after all of its effects are considered. Assessments of “safety and efficacy” for pharmaceuticals and medical devices and therapeutic procedures involve a cost-benefit calculation. The reason drug commercials feature long recitations of horrendous possible side effects is that risks remain even in officially safe and effective therapies. It’s just that the benefit has been judged to be worth those risks.
It simply has not been clear in much of the public discussion and debate over the lockdown that a serious balancing test of this kind has been applied. Instead, we’ve heard many echoes of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s much noted remark, as the Associated Press puts it, “that if all of his sweeping, expensive measures to stem the coronavirus saved one life, it would be worth it.”
There is no reason to question anyone’s motives or best efforts. Much of the problem lies in an asymmetry in the vivid visibility of the ravages of the disease compared with the ravages of the cure. Many, many millions of Americans are in households that have suffered job losses. Many watch helplessly as businesses wither.
But such vast miseries are too enormous and diffused to feel vividly and viscerally. The daily COVID-19 death count — delivered breathlessly by the media in a way it never reports the every day death toll from familiar causes — dramatizes tragedy on a more human scale.
What’s more, with the vast majority of governors having once put in place sweeping lockdowns, which among them now can dare to be the first to relax restrictions? No doubt this political dilemma — and a desire to create safety in numbers — is part of the motivation for the “pacts” now being formed among neighboring states to coordinate plans for reopening their economies.
It might also help to prepare the public for the unknowable results of that risk-taking if leaders talked more candidly about our need to fully consider all the dangers we confront in this struggle."

"April 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-hospitals-stretching-conserving-covid-19-masks/569677902/,StarTribune,"Minnesota hospitals stretching, conserving COVID-19 masks","Hospitals are using ultraviolet decontamination to stretch their supply of high-filtration N95 masks that protect doctors and other caregivers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which to date has caused 87 deaths and 1,809 lab-confirmed infections in Minnesota.
M Health Fairview hospitals now allow N95s to be reused up to six times if they are decontaminated after each use and remain intact — which dramatically increases its capacity of personal protective equipment, or PPE.
“We’re hopeful we can get at least two times [more use out of masks] or up to six times, somewhere in that range,” said Dr. Abraham Jacob, M Health Fairview’s chief quality officer.
A PPE shortage has been a grave concern for Minnesota health officials as they predicted the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by a new, highly infectious coronavirus to which nobody initially had immunity. Nurses have voiced concerns as well about a shortage, but also about the safety of reusing decontaminated masks.
Gov. Tim Walz unveiled wide-ranging estimates last week, including that Minnesota could run out of PPE at the peak of the state’s outbreak this summer. The governor said he is feeling more confident this week due to new shipments, efforts to stretch existing supplies, and the possibility that COVID-19 outbreaks in other states will peak and reduce nationwide PPE demand.
“Those are the things that keep you up,” Walz said of a mask shortage. “I think there’s reasons to believe that we are building toward the capacity that we need.”
New problems emerge, though. Minnesota’s emergency stockpile has increased from 377,000 N95 masks on April 7 to 409,000 now — with another 1.6 million scheduled for delivery. But the state lists a supply of only 68,000 gowns — and no more set for delivery.
Walz on Wednesday also reiterated his demand for medical providers to increase the state’s capacity for diagnostic molecular tests for COVID-19 to 5,000 per day. He also wants thousands of daily antibody tests, such as those recently unveiled by the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic, to determine when people have recovered from infection.
“Until we get a vaccine, we are going to have to be able to identify who is sick,” he said.
Mayo is hoping to double its capacity from 10,000 to 20,000 antibody tests per day so that it can perform surveillance to understand the breadth of the pandemic, said Dr. William Morice, president of Mayo Clinic Laboratories.
“One of the uses for this test at some point will be to test as many individuals as possible so we really have a good sense of how much this infection has actually spread,” he said.
‘Uncharted territory’
Duluth-based Essentia Health adopted an N95 mask decontamination process this month that was developed in Nebraska and listed as a “promising” contingency by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention due to any shortages.
HealthPartners on Wednesday announced plans to use ultraviolet light from a disinfecting robot to treat hundreds of N95 respirator masks daily. Allina Health and Mayo Clinic are exploring technological options, too.
“We are in uncharted territory, and we need to be flexible,” said Dr. Mark Sannes, a senior medical director at HealthPartners, a Bloomington-based health system.
Nurses’ union leaders have objected, though, citing concerns that certain UV decontamination approaches might leave residue or substances on the masks that would be harmful for nurses to inhale.
“I find it very alarming that everyone is getting so excited about this because they could look up the same research,” said Mary Turner, president of the Minnesota Nurses Association and a critical care nurse treating COVID-19 cases at North Memorial Health Hospital in Robbinsdale.
Union leaders are lobbying Minnesota’s congressional delegation to instead urge President Donald Trump to enact wartime levels of production nationwide of masks.
HealthPartners said in a statement that Maplewood-based 3M, the mask manufacturer, conducted tests that confirm N95 respirators could be decontaminated up to 10 times without causing significant damage to fit and filtration. Fairview and 3M also collaborated on weeks of testing to make sure the UV treatment caused no degradation or holes in the masks.
3M in a technical guide this month said it is examining multiple methods of safely sterilizing N95s but discourages the use of ethylene oxide due to inhalation risks, as well as ionizing radiation, microwaves or high temperatures that damage the masks.
Normally, doctors and nurses treating a patient would discard N95 masks between patients, Sannes said. Now, caregivers are using one N95 mask per day.
Some caregivers have been following a CDC-listed strategy of putting masks into paper bags at the end of shifts, and not using them for five days, because the virus can’t survive that long, Sannes said. With robotic disinfection, at the end of shifts caregivers put their masks on designated shelves for cleaning.
Unlike common medical masks, N95s are fitted to provide extra protection, meaning they can’t be tossed in group bins for decontamination.
At Fairview hospitals, caregivers put the masks in paper bags and write their names on them. At a time when items as simple as cotton swabs for lab testing are in short supply, Jacob said he has contemplated the possibility of paper bags running short.
Early signs of payoff
Minnesota on Wednesday reported another 114 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases and eight deaths — all in long-term care facilities.
State health officials have responded with increased training and oversight of long-term care facilities, because residents are at higher risk of severe infections due to their age and health status.
State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said there are early signs of a payoff. While 108 long-term care facilities have reported outbreaks involving infected workers or residents, only half have had more than one case.
“It really does suggest to us that infection control is really helping limit the spread of those infections,” she said.
Shortages of personal protective equipment affect long-term care facilities as well. Walz said the state needs millions more PPE items than it has in stock, and he has been frustrated by the irregular supply coming from the federal government as well as a seizure of items in China that had been bound for Minnesota.
In the last week, though, Minnesota companies have stepped up efforts to secure masks and other supplies from their locations around the globe, said Alice Roberts-Davis, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Administration who is heading up the state’s COVID-19 supply procurement.
“We are starting to see a pretty steady flow of PPE into the state that we are able to get to our front-line health care workers,” she said."
"April 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-jobless-rate-nears-20-though-precise-figure-is-elusive/569696822/,StarTribune,Job losses hitting nearly 20% of Minnesota workers,"New data released Thursday suggests close to one in five Minnesota workers is unemployed or lost work in the past six weeks, a clear sign that the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus, one that has struck with stunning speed, is the worst since the Great Depression.
The national picture is similarly grim, with another 5.2 million Americans filing for unemployment this week, bringing the total over the past four weeks to more than 22 million.
""Every piece of evidence that's coming in says that in terms of magnitude, this is comparable right now to the Great Depression from 1929 to 1933,"" said V.V. Chari, an economist at the University of Minnesota.
But in contrast to that era, the damage now is unfolding over a handful of months rather than years.
""This is unprecedented in American economic history. It's horrific,"" Chari said. ""It's causing widespread, extensive economic damage.""
U.S. public life remains shut down, and the testing needed to build public confidence and hasten a return to a more normal way of life is weeks away in Minnesota and most of the country.
Employment, income, housing starts, manufacturing indices and retail sales have all shown sharp contractions. GDP, which is driven by consumer spending, will as well.
""Even if people get their jobs back, it's going to take a while for consumer spending to go up,"" said Charlie Weaver, executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership. ""You don't have the disposable incomes available to people that they used to have, to buy a [nicer] bed or a four-wheeler or discretionary things that they would be buying.""
The state Department of Employment and Economic Development released job figures for March on Thursday, based on surveys conducted before Minnesotans started practicing social distancing and closing nonessential businesses.
As a result, the Minnesota unemployment rate for March will go in the books as 3.1%, unchanged from February.
The data showed 118,543 people meeting the criteria for unemployment: They were looking for a job but didn't have one.
Already, the data is woefully out of date, and the official figures won't show the chaos of recent weeks until the next report on May 21.
As well, the strict definition of unemployment, which is standard for U.S. labor statistics, is also misleading: Though 46,000 fewer Minnesotans were working in March than in February, the state counted only 8,000 as newly unemployed.
And this was all before Minnesotans were ordered to stay home at the end of March.
Since March 16, more than 482,000 Minnesotans have filed for unemployment, and though the government doesn't necessarily view those workers as unemployed, that number is likely an undercount because not everyone who lost work has filed a jobless claim.
The lag in economic data and the gap between the numbers and reality — the April U.S. jobs report captured only a sliver of the damage done in March — has frustrated economists and confused the public.
An economist at Arizona State University, Alexander Bick, published a preliminary paper on Wednesday attempting to create real-time labor market statistics, arguing that the three-week lag that serves policymakers well in normal times is not suited for the current crisis.
Bick and his research partner Adam Blandin estimate the economy has lost 24 million jobs since the Department of Labor last collected data and that the U.S. unemployment rate is 20.2%, up from the 4.5% announced the first week of April.
They calculate that hours worked declined by 25% over the past month, with half of the decline coming from layoffs and the other half coming from reductions in hours.
""Declines were most pronounced for workers who were female, older and less educated,"" Bick and Blandin wrote.
The uncertainty of the virus — over how many people will die, how long immunity may last, and the potential severity of second or third waves of the outbreak — is devilish for businesses, workers and the economy.
""Even if we determine that the coronavirus is not a serious threat, we will see a prolonged period of weakness in the economy as we figure out how to live in a new normal,"" the U's Chari said.
""If the virus turns out to be much more resistant to any policy measures, then you're going to see extended periods of shelter-in-place.
""On top of all that, there are serious concerns about a second or third wave. So I don't know. It looks pretty grim.""
And the worst of the economic pain will be felt by the young, Chari said, those entering the job market or those who will enter the job market in the next year or two. The effect on their income will be lifelong.
""The longer this continues, the longer you are condemning a whole generation of bright-eyed 18-year-olds, the future of this country, to starting off and then quite possibly for quite a long time, being substantially poorer,"" Chari said. ""Especially disadvantaged kids."""

Tim Walz’s “moon shot” proposal for 5,000 daily COVID-19 diagnostic tests in Minnesota appears within reach after the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic unveiled aggressive in-state solutions for a global testing shortage.
While contingent on $20 million in state funding, the U on Thursday proposed ramping up its lab capacity in Minneapolis to conduct 10,000 daily molecular tests to diagnose active infections and 10,000 daily serological antibody tests to find people who have recovered.
Walz has called for more in-state testing to track the outbreak before he scales back the current stay-at-home order, which is scheduled to end May 4. The U should be ready then, said Dr. Timothy Schacker, the U medical school’s vice dean for research.
“Our aim is to be up and running by that time, for sure,” he said.
The two testing types work at opposite ends of the COVID-19 spectrum — with the molecular tests of nasal or throat swabs finding the active presence of the virus, and the serological tests of blood serum finding virus-fighting antibodies after people have recovered. Walz has said both are needed to map the severity and course of the pandemic.
Mayo Clinic’s commercial reference lab, the third largest in the country, already had capacity for 7,500 molecular diagnostic tests per day and has been a key resource early in the pandemic. About 25,000 such tests, more than half of the 41,675 performed so far in the state, were done by Mayo.
Now the Rochester, Minn., lab is looking to increase that capacity and double the number of antibody tests — from 10,000 to 20,000 per day — which among other things could be used for surveillance of entire work sites to determine which workers have recovered and are no longer infection risks.
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has proved more infectious than expected — with Chinese researchers publishing estimates in Nature Medicine this week that 44% of infections are transmitted before patients have symptoms.
Testing for immunity
Whether people have immunity following infection with this virus — which first emerged in December in Wuhan, China — is unclear, but research of the SARS coronavirus pandemic in 2002-2003 found evidence of immunity that lasted for years.
“We are inferring that there is protective immunity here,” said Dan Huff, an assistant commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Health, in testimony regarding testing to the House Health and Human Services Finance committee on Thursday.
Republican lawmakers have grown increasingly critical of the economic toll of the ongoing statewide stay-at-home order.
At Thursday’s Senate HHS Finance and Policy Committee hearing, Sen. Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, asked why the state was taking a broader stay-at-home approach when modeling showed similar outcomes under a scenario that restricted only the elderly and people with other health problems at greatest risk of complications from COVID-19.
Walz did not participate in a daily COVID-19 media briefing Thursday. But earlier this week, he said the state wasn’t ready for a scaled-back approach until it had enough testing capacity to track the spread of the virus.
Mayo and the U aren’t the only labs adding capacity. HCMC in Minneapolis can now conduct 600 diagnostic tests per day, which Dr. Daniel Hoody, chief medical officer, said is a key resource in an urban area given national studies showing that COVID-19 has been harder on minorities.
“The pattern is irrefutable,” Hoody told lawmakers at the House hearing on testing.
With the addition of 103 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases and seven deaths on Thursday, the Minnesota Department of Health reported a total of 1,912 cases and 94 deaths statewide. Limited testing has undercounted the true number of infections, though, with state health officials predicting there could be 100 cases for every lab-confirmed case.
State health leaders are preparing for the ramp-up in testing by discussing which priority groups should receive them first.
‘Long ways to go’
The Health Department already has a long list of target groups for molecular testing, including people who get sick who are elderly, child-care workers or emergency first-responders, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.
While testing of asymptomatic people could help identify more cases early on — when infected people appear at greatest risk of spreading the virus — Ehresmann said the state will continue to work through these high-risk groups first when they get sick.
“We will move to another level of symptomatic testing first before we would start asymptomatic testing,” she said, adding that “we have a long ways to go.”
The Health Department’s priority list is only a guide, though, and one lab is planning to use its newly created capacity of 400 COVID-19 diagnostic tests per day in a different way.
OralDNA Labs in Eden Prairie plans to offer testing, symptoms or not, to all dentists in Minnesota, which could take the pressure off emergency departments that are receiving patients with dental emergencies. The lab also will offer testing for free to Eden Prairie firefighters.
“One of the characteristics of this virus that is so dangerous is that it can be spread by carriers who are completely unaware that they are infected,” said George Hoedeman, chief executive of the lab. ”Testing will be an important tool to reopen dental offices and the state of Minnesota.”
Mayo and U officials also unveiled new forms of testing they are studying. Mayo researchers are trying to test for the presence of the coronavirus in tissues, which among other things would be important for evaluating transplant donors, and for ways to predict severe illness.
The U is exploring a faster diagnostic process, which might be slightly less accurate, Schacker said, but would cut out a prolonged step of extracting RNA from specimen samples, and would not require chemicals and supplies that are in short supply worldwide."
"April 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/authorities-warn-consumers-to-beware-of-coronavirus-related-scams/569736562/,StarTribune,Authorities warn consumers to beware of coronavirus-related scams,"Authorities warn consumers to beware of coronavirus-related scamsLocal authorities have warned residents to beware of predatory scammers who are using the ongoing pandemic to defraud Minnesotans.
The coronavirus crisis has created a ""perfect storm for scam activity,"" said Bao Vang, spokeswoman for the Better Business Bureau (BBB) of Minnesota and North Dakota.
Consumers are more susceptible to fraud because they are isolated and not as exposed to news, experiencing more financial and emotional vulnerability and desperation, spending more time online and generally feeling more distracted, Vang said.
Last week, the local BBB and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hosted a webinar on how to avoid scams during the COVID-19 crisis.
""In times of uncertainty or disasters there is a greater risk for consumers and businesses falling victim to the skillful yet malicious intent of fraudsters,"" BBB President and CEO Susan Adams Loyd said.
Public safety departments, financial institutions and other agencies have also sent warnings to consumers on coronavirus-related fraud.
""As we come together to combat COVID-19, Minnesotans need to be just as vigilant about protecting their pocketbooks from scammers as they are about keeping themselves and their communities healthy,"" said Attorney General Keith Ellison in a statement last month.
The FTC's database of consumer fraud complaints reported 18,000 complaints and $13.4 million in losses to coronavirus scams nationally.
Some of the most common coronavirus scams include:
• Fake treatment and miracle cures. Beware of websites selling bogus products as cures. Ignore online and telephone offers for vaccinations, tests and cures.
• Suspicious e-mails or texts from purported organizations or government agencies like the World Health Organization or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Often words are misspelled. Don't click on links or e-mails from sources you don't know that could contain malware.
• False debt-relief inquiries. More fraudulent robocalls are offering fake debt-relief programs or telling consumers to pay money up front or give personal information to get stimulus checks. Be cautious of someone who says they can get you money immediately. Just hang up the phone.
• Fake charities. Often during a crisis, scammers create fake organizations to solicit donations. Before you donate, do research on the groups for verification. Beware of solicitors who want donations in cash, gift cards or money wire.
• Employment scams. When people are underemployed or unemployed, they might look for other jobs. Resist the temptation to rush into applying and sending personal information without researching a company. If job listings sound too good to be true, they likely are.
If residents believe they have been the victim of a scam, a complaint can be filed with the Minnesota Attorney General's Office online or by calling (651) 296-3353 (metro) or (800) 657-3787 (greater Minnesota). Consumers can also report scam activity and suspicious behavior to the BBB at bbb.org/scamtracker. You can also call the BBB at 651-699-1111 to speak with a local representative."
"April 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/germany-s-exemplary-covid-19-response/569742292/,StarTribune,Germany's exemplary COVID-19 response,"Germany’s coronavirus mitigation measures have resulted in a “fragile intermediate success,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday as she announced that the country would begin to slowly open back up starting this week.
“Fragile intermediate success” sounds more hopeful than boastful. But that’s in keeping with Merkel’s cautious, consensus-building style that was just one of the factors contributing to a relatively low COVID-19 death toll of 4,105 for 138,369 documented cases through last Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University data. By way of comparison, hard-hit Italy and the United Kingdom have tragically had much higher totals: 22,170 deaths and 168,941 documented cases in Italy and 14,606 deaths amid 109,754 cases in the U.K.
Germany’s tracking of cases through aggressive testing has helped keep the fatality rate low through early identification of carriers, including asymptomatic ones. The outbreak in Germany also developed differently, with relatively younger patients who contracted the virus at ski resorts, or in the original epicenter, a Bavarian car parts company, where researchers were able to track the first transmission to the passing of a saltshaker, according to a report from the World Economic Forum.
Germany tested and traced aggressively, and because of prior planning did not face any shocking shortages of tests, ventilators, personal protective equipment and ICU beds, among other necessary elements of a modern health system, let alone modern society. More profoundly, Germany, despite the deep political and social divisions endemic to any Western democracy, has widespread consensus on the severity of the pandemic and the strategy to fight it.
And it’s not just coming from the top; Germany has a federalist system similar to the U.S. (which mostly designed it in the postwar era), and so Merkel worked closely with state and regional leaders. But in the end, she led, according to Jorn Fleck, associate director at the Atlantic Council. Merkel deployed a “personal plea with the Germans to understand that this is a common effort, that we have to stay together, that we have to take care of everyone in society and especially those that are more vulnerable,” Fleck told an editorial writer. Merkel addressed the nation for the first time outside of the traditional Christmas address, Fleck said, adding to the gravity of the appeal.
The contrast couldn’t be stronger to President Donald Trump’s endless riffing at his mostly nonproductive news conferences.
And unlike the president’s hastily arranged, ad hoc councils to open up the economy (many members only learned of their participation when Trump read their names during a White House briefing), Merkel turned to the Leopoldina, of German National Academy of Sciences, an august institution that began in 1652 and includes a range of experts, including social scientists.
Merkel’s “calm demeanor is an asset,” Henning Schroeder, director of international programs at the University of Minnesota’s College of Pharmacy, told an editorial writer. Referencing her background as an engineer, Schroeder added that “the way she operates and tackles problems you can tell that’s her background.” And, Schroder concluded, it’s a good sign that Merkel turns to experts. “Even if they are from an ivory tower, they know more than talk-show hosts.”
Germany, Merkel said, doesn’t have “much room to maneuver.” Whatever it does have is due to the chancellor leading a rational, data-driven scientific consensus on how to mitigate the crisis — an approach that has been tragically lacking in Washington."
"April 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/covid-19-let-s-work-together-on-a-plan-to-reopen-minnesota-s-economy/569742482/,StarTribune,"Tom Emmer, Paul Gazelka: Let's work together on a plan to reopen Minnesota's economy","Over the past month, hundreds of business owners, employees, parents and residents have flooded our offices with messages of confusion and concern about our state’s response to the coronavirus and what it means for them. The fear is real, and the concern about contracting a virus with no known cure weighs heavy on their minds. However, equal concern is expressed about the lost paychecks, the survival of businesses, the disruption in education and the long-term upheaval of supply chains resulting from the extended stay-at-home order currently in place.
Businesses of all sizes — from hair salons to the Mayo Clinic and Best Buy — and Minnesotans at every rung of the income ladder are feeling the impact of this unprecedented action. The frustration and sense of helplessness could not be more palpable. As we shared this feedback with Gov. Tim Walz, we have seen additional exemptions added to the list of essential businesses, including landscapers, marinas and dock installers.
However, simply expanding the list of “essential” businesses one at a time is the wrong approach to keeping Minnesota’s economy afloat.
We recognize there is no perfect science to determine exactly “how” and “when” to lift the broad range of restrictions currently in place. However, with more than 451,470 unemployment insurance claims filed since March 16, understanding the long-term economic impacts of the governor’s extended executive order is a priority on footing equal to that of getting expansive COVID-19 testing in the state.
Unfortunately, the lack of public coordination, data and planning from our state’s executive indicates this is not the case.
Now, this is not to say we are completely without progress. Earlier this week the governor signaled a renewed interest in working with state legislators to measure and coordinate the economic impacts of our response. Elements of his administration’s health modeling also indicate that we can protect the elderly and vulnerable while opening the economy without significant change in the risk to the population from COVID-19. And the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) has begun listening to the calls from businesses to establish recommendations for reopening.
Nevertheless, workers, families and businesses in Minnesota remain without certainty or a clear plan of action to get them back to work.
Elected leaders — during times of calm or crisis — must chart and adjust course as necessary to achieve the best possible outcome for the people they serve. We understand that reopening Minnesota will look different for various industries and from business to business. Rather than a one-size fits all “essential” business qualification, we propose allowing businesses to meet the social distancing and sanitization guidelines in their own unique ways so they can open safely and quickly.
Minnesota is home to amazing people who are up to the challenge and will do what’s right and healthy for themselves and for their customers. We hear over and over again, “I can open up and keep people safe,” and we should trust our small businesses and employers to do the best thing for their employees and customers.
Moreover, though the totality of Minnesota’s wage, revenue and economic losses from COVID-19 remains to be seen, they will continue to grow the longer our state remains closed. As the governor seeks to abate these losses, we strongly encourage him to refrain from following the lead of his counterparts in other states who are devising their COVID-19 response around an expectation that the federal government will make them whole through more multitrillion-dollar stimulus packages. Those expectations are severely misguided and only contribute to the larger and more existential crisis for Minnesota and the United States in the future: government stimulus simply cannot revive our entire economy.
Getting people back to work is not only healthy for the economy, but healthy for the mind and spirit of the hardworking people of this state. We have absolute confidence Minnesotans can reignite our economy while staying physically healthy by following recommended distancing and sanitization guidelines.
We recognize there is no playbook or instruction manual on how to respond to a situation like this. And we can say with confidence that every elected official has been working around the clock to do what they feel is right for the residents of our great state. But every Minnesotan deserves certainty that our response to one crisis will not create another.
Gov. Walz needs to put forward a plan to reopen Minnesota’s economy as soon as possible and give all Minnesotans the certainty they need to get back to work. Collaborating with private and public partnerships, listening to businesses of all sizes, Minnesotans deserve a road map to reopen Minnesota, prevent catastrophic COVID-19 surges, and stabilize the lives and livelihoods of our great citizens."
"April 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/feds-announce-19-billion-aid-plan-for-u-s-farmers-food-industry/569749212/,StarTribune,"Feds announce $19 billion aid plan for U.S. farmers, food industry","WASHINGTON - Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue rolled out a $19 billion rescue plan Friday for a long list of agriculture sectors that say the ripple effects of the COVID-19 pandemic through supply chains and markets will force many farmers out of business.
Perdue is likely to come under scrutiny over fairness in distributing billions of dollars in direct payments to a cross section of farmers and ranchers, just as he was regarding distribution of trade aid to compensate farmers for lost foreign markets during trade disputes. However, few in agriculture are likely to question the need for help during the pandemic.
In a statement, the secretary said he is pulling together funding and authorities provided in two economic relief packages and using $873 million of existing USDA funding for food purchases. The department’s umbrella name for the aid package is the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program.
Of the $19 billion, $16 billion in direct payments to farmers and ranchers will be “based on actual losses for agricultural producers where prices and market supply chains have been impacted and will assist producers with additional adjustment and marketing costs resulting from lost demand and short-term oversupply for the 2020 marketing year caused by COVID-19,” Perdue said in the statement.
Eligibility criteria, payment rates and other implementation details will be released at a later date, the USDA said.
The department will use $3 billion to purchase a variety of agricultural and food products. Purchases are a standard tool the USDA uses to remove surplus products from the market to keep market prices from declining.
However, the USDA is taking a new approach to deal with COVID-19 and will spend money with regional and local distributors hit hard by closures of restaurants, hotels and other institutional food service providers. The USDA will buy $300 million a month in fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products and meat. The food will be sent by distributors and wholesalers in preapproved boxes to food banks, community and faith-based organizations, and other nonprofits that serve low-income people.
Several agriculture-related industries and their congressional supporters, including apple, biofuel, bison, catfish, cattle, corn, cotton, dairy, pork and soybeans, have argued for aid since Congress approved the most recent U.S. economic relief bill.
COVID-19 has highlighted the interconnectedness of the food and agriculture supply chains. Public health closures and service restrictions on farmers markets, restaurants and institutional food service affected small farmers who sold direct to consumers as well as larger beef, poultry and pork operations.
Stay-at-home directives in cities and states reduced demand for gasoline and biofuels made from corn and soybeans. Slowdowns and temporary closings of meat, poultry and pork slaughtering and processing plants due to rising numbers of employees sickened or killed by COVID-19 means the plants require fewer animals from farmers and lower prices for livestock. The bottleneck, however, means higher retail prices amid strong consumer demand.
This marks the third time in three years that Perdue has directed massive spending to aid farmers and ranchers, many of whom have experienced six years of low prices and two years of trade fights.
In 2018 and 2019, the department provided a total of nearly $23 billion in direct payments to help producers that lost sales to overseas markets as China and other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs that made selected U.S. farm goods more expensive than their competitors. The department also made $2.6 billion in purchases over those two years for products it sent to food banks and federal nutrition programs."
"April 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/executive-survey-minnesota-business-leaders-watch-walz-closely-his-next-decision-could-break-some/569739292/,StarTribune,Minnesota business leaders say Walz's next move could make or break them,"As doctors and nurses wage the primary battle against the coronavirus, a secondary conflict is gaining intensity: how to ease the price paid by closed businesses, schools and idled workers. Since mid-March, more Americans lost their jobs more quickly than any time in history. Minnesota just six weeks ago was one of the strongest economies in the country, but now nearly one in five people in the state’s labor force is jobless.
Pressure grew all last week for government leaders to chart an end to their stay-home orders and nonessential business designations — and to allow businesses and consumers to adapt to the new reality.
In New Ulm, a co-owner of the Penazz Aveda hair salon, Melissa Lawson, said her stylists and customers are ready to go as soon as Gov. Tim Walz allows. “We’re going to open right away. That Monday if possible,” she said, assuming he will designate a Monday start. “It will be busy.”
But business will be different, Lawson added. Stylists will wear face masks and gloves and sanitize more often. Customers will not be allowed to bring a friend or a child. “We’ll probably eliminate our front seating area,” Lawson said.
Many Minnesota businesses have already made sweeping changes. Others are being told they can’t open. For some, Walz’s next decision could make or break them.
The Star Tribune last week interviewed decisionmakers in businesses around the state about when and how to start the next chapter of the crisis. Here’s what they said:
Patina Stores Inc.
Christine Ward, owner of Patina Stores, a gift and furnishings retailer that has been around the Twin Cities for 25 years, said Walz holds the fate of the company in his hands.
Ward last week received a Small Business Administration loan to cover payroll costs and must start using the funds this week. But the state won’t let work happen in Patina’s eight stores.
She wants Walz to give retailers like Patina the same opportunity to do business that he has to liquor stores, coffee shops and garden centers. She said smaller stores can more easily adapt to the new normal than the stores that are currently drawing crowds.
“The safety and health of our employees and customers is the most critical issue for us,” Ward said. “We can match what other businesses that were allowed to remain open are doing. As entrepreneurs, we feel we excel in adapting.”
She’s installing plexiglass at checkouts and already stocked masks, gloves and cleaning equipment at the company’s eight stores. She has been able to defer some bills but Patina needs to open next month, Ward said, or it will have to close for good.
“There’s no thinking past the end of May for us. There is too much mounting debt,” she said.
Shoppers will make more cautious choices because of the virus, Ward said. “People are not going to go into a store that feels unsafe,” she said.
Life Time Inc.
Bahram Akradi has been thinking big thoughts about what it will take to get the economy on its feet. The founder and chief executive of Life Time Inc. created a website (bahramakradi.com) to lay out the particulars and last week became one of about 200 corporate heads on President Donald Trump’s “economic revival” group.
Life Time has furloughed nearly 37,000 workers — about 90% of its workforce — and put on hold nearly $1 billion in new development. The Chanhassen-based company is maintaining health coverage of its workers and set aside $10 million for employees who need more help than unemployment insurance can provide.
Bringing workers back will require “massive, massive, massive testing,” he said, adding Life Time will pay whatever it takes to get his workforce tested and vaccinated.
“If we couldn’t get access to tests in the broader community for two more months, that would be really bad,” Akradi said. “If we could get tests in the next week or two, that are easy and able to be broadly used, we can have this thing behind us in three weeks.”
With more than 150 locations in 41 major markets in the U.S. and Canada, Akradi suggested that fitness centers in cities that have hit their peak, such as New York, might open sooner than Minnesota, where public health officials said social distancing has successfully delayed a predicted surge of critical cases.
“Our governor has done a great job protecting Minnesotans. We’ll potentially have a later peak,” he said.
Xcel Energy Inc.
About half of the 5,000 workers at the state’s biggest utility have been working from home over the past month. The other half, chiefly in power plants and in the field, are deemed “essential” under the state’s work order.
Ben Fowke, the company’s chief executive, said Xcel will be “conservative” about bringing workers back to offices until there is more testing for the virus and its antibodies. “I don’t feel a tremendous amount of pressure to bring people back absolutely as soon as possible,” he said.
The company will continue minimizing contact between workers and it routinely tests the temperature of people in the power plants. Remote work and more flexibility in work hours may become standard at the company because of the experience of the past month, Fowke said.
“We will go slow regardless of what the orders allow us to do,” he said. “We have learned how to work remotely, and we want to keep our workers safe.”
Digi International Inc.
With offices around the globe, the Minnetonka-based maker of cellular gateways, chipsets and components for internet-of-things products began coping with the virus in January by closing offices in China, where the outbreak began. Its offices in Beijing and Shanghai have now reopened but employees in locations where schools are closed are still chiefly working from home.
“That part of the world is not new to these outbreaks,” Chief Executive Ron Konezny said. “We’ve had the chance to learn quite a bit from them.”
While most employees are working remotely, Digi modified offices and warehouses to encourage people to keep a safer distance from each other. Digi and other companies will probably curtail business travel for a long period, Konezny said. Traditional interactions with business partners and customers, at conventions or lunches and dinners, will also be reduced.
“There won’t be a moment when, boom, everything is done,” he said. “This is going to be more localized and more on and off.”
The company will take cues from government officials in all the places it operates, Konezny said.
“What we’re seeing with our employees is that local government has an important impact on how they feel,” he said. “If we make a decision that’s inconsistent with the local authority, that starts to question well why is Digi doing this?”
Two Inlets Resort
Kayla Daigle and her husband, James, bought the Two Inlets Resort in Park Rapids two years ago and are expecting to open the doors May 7, ahead of the Fishing Opener.
It’s a dicey time financially for the new owners, who have a 5-year old son and 2-year-old daughter, and bills that will come due whether or not the 13 cabins are occupied. “To say I’m concerned would be putting it lightly,” Kayla Daigle said.
The resort occupies a small stretch along the shore of Two Inlets Lake, a short drive from Itasca State Park.
Daigle studied the latest guidelines from the CDC and Minnesota public health officials, and is already making adjustments.
The traditional potluck won’t happen. They’re stocking up on gloves and masks and will set up sanitation stations at key locations, such as near the fishing pier. And she talked to a nurse friend to see if he would be available to come up for the summer to do health screenings, answer questions or provide medical care if needed.
“We just want our guests to feel safe and still be able to enjoy their summer vacations where they recharge for the year,” she said.
Rather than have guests come into the lobby to check in, Daigle may figure out a way to do a drive-up or handle things via text. The couple may limit visitors to six nights instead of the usual seven to give cabins a day to air out before cleaning begins. They have thought about not providing linens at all.
“We’re being creative,” she said. “We’re relatively small so we can problem-solve around those things better than other resorts. We feel like a family around here.”
Redpath and Co.
Mark Gibbs, managing partner for the St. Paul-based accounting firm, said nearly all of its 165 employees are working from home — and can stay there even after a stay-home order is lifted.
“People who aren’t comfortable can still work at home, as can those who need to work at home because they are also taking care of kids not in school or day care,” Gibbs said.
The firm’s offices in St. Paul and White Bear Lake are filled with cubicles and offices that already impose some social distancing. But the company also stocked up on hand sanitizer and other cleaning materials.
Gibbs said he anticipates fewer face-to-face meetings and more video chats. The firm has purchased numerous licenses for the Zoom video platform. It also recently purchased software for clients to sign documents electronically, instead of exchanging paper documents. “We might have done this anyway, but this crisis made us jump into the technology sooner,” he said.
“We are trying to follow the orders,” Gibbs said. “The governor’s order has a lot of impact.”
Digi-Key Electronics Inc.
Around 2,300 employees for Digi-Key Electronics, the components distributor based in Thief River Falls, have been working from home during the pandemic.
“We transitioned to that over about two days, so kudos to our IT staff,” said Kevin Brown, its vice president of communications.
More than 600 are performing essential work at the firm’s warehouses, he said.
When the stay-home order is lifted, the company will bring employees back to offices in phases, he said.
The company has already implemented “extreme sanitization procedures” for staff working now, including sanitization breaks every two hours, a tunnel that uses UV rays to disinfect the bins used to move products around the warehouse, gloves and masks for workers, more separation between employees, and a contract with an outside cleaning firm to disinfect the warehouses at the end of each day.
“We’ve also become much more adept at videoconferencing,” Brown said."
"April 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/rally-urges-gov-tim-walz-to-liberate-minnesota/569736462/,StarTribune,Trump-backed rally urges Gov. Tim Walz to 'Liberate Minnesota',"Emboldened by tweets from President Donald Trump, hundreds of people rallied outside Gov. Tim Walz’s residence Friday to oppose his stay-home orders imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The “Liberate Minnesota” rally, estimated by St. Paul police at about 800 protesters, was cheered by Republican leaders in Minnesota who have grown increasingly critical of record job losses that have followed the social distancing directives.
In a sign of the deepening partisan rift over the COVID-19 pandemic in Congress and in state houses across the country, rallies aimed at Democratic governors have accused them of “tyranny,” echoing themes of the Tea Party movement of the Obama era.
However, unlike in the Tea Party era, the sitting president is actively fomenting the protests, though few have been directed at GOP governors pursuing nearly identical policies.
Trump, picking up on the name of the Minnesota protest organizers, tweeted in all caps: “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” on Friday and sent the same slogan out regarding Michigan and Virginia, also states with Democratic governors.
Trump’s attempt to raise anger against those governors came just a day after he abdicated any responsibility on the topic of opening up states again and said governors would “call your own shots” on easing restrictions.
Protest groups have been organizing in other states, notably Michigan, where thousands of people, some armed, some wearing masks, flouted social distancing and stay-home orders Wednesday in a rally on the steps of the State Capitol.
Protests also have taken place in Virginia and Kentucky. A similar rally is planned for April 24 in Madison, Wis.
Walz said Friday afternoon that he had tried calling Trump and Vice President Mike Pence but had not received return calls.
“I just don’t have time to figure out why something like that would happen,” Walz said of the president’s tweet. He added he was doing what the president asked all governors to do Thursday — lead the local response.
“I think we are moving in the right direction,” Walz said.
The main organizers of the St. Paul rally, Michele Even of Credit River Township and Don Huizenga of Anoka, have ties to conservative activism and Minnesota Republican politics.
Even said that politics is not the point, but rather to express concerns about what they see as an overly drastic response that is devastating thousands of small businesses and other sectors of the economy. “The shutdown of our state reaches across party affiliations,” Even said. “It affects every citizen of our state regardless of where you stand politically.”
The St. Paul rally played out as state lawmakers gave final approval to legislation allowing restaurants to sell takeout alcohol, a demand of the powerful hospitality industry at the Capitol. Although the new liquor rules have bipartisan support, Republicans in the Minnesota House took turns railing against Walz’s emergency powers and sharing stories about the hardships of constituent business owners.
“Our citizens want hope. They want to know that there is an end date,” said Rep. Mary Franson, R-Alexandria. Franson, wearing a red “Let Minnesotans Work Again” T-shirt, has vowed on Twitter to ignore Walz’s stay-home order.
That order is set to last until at least May 4. Some GOP leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, have come out against any extension.
But some Minnesota business leaders have cautioned against reopening the economy too quickly, and national polls have generally shown clear support for the shelter-in-place directives across party lines.
A new Politico/Morning Consult poll found the vast majority of voters support continuing the social-distancing measures. More than eight in 10 voters — including 72% of Republicans — said Americans “should continue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy.”
Only 10% said Americans “should stop social distancing to stimulate the economy, even if it means increasing the spread of coronavirus.”
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, urged a cautious approach in a Fox News interview Thursday night.
Despite Minnesota’s business closures, Walz administration officials say that nearly 80% of jobs are estimated to be in critical fields that are still operating. Walz has recently allowed a few more sectors, such as lawn care, to resume work.
Friday’s protest came as Walz lifted restrictions on golf courses and other outdoor venues, a move that was welcomed by Republican lawmakers.
“I hope this is just a first step that paves the way for other businesses to open in a way that protects the health and safety of employees,” House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said in a statement.
Daudt led an effort in the Minnesota House on Tuesday to end Walz’s peacetime emergency powers and begin the process of reopening the state economy. The resolution failed on a party-line vote.
Republicans in the Minnesota Senate also have set up a web page to take suggestions from business owners on how to open their businesses safely and maintain social distance. Jason Lewis, a GOP candidate for U.S. Senate, announced an RV tour of the state to highlight the shutdown struggles of business owners.
Lewis, running against DFL incumbent Sen. Tina Smith, showed up at the rally outside the governor’s residence.
Many of the protesters waved American flags; also on display were flags, signs and banners supporting Trump. Other protesters carried handmade signs bearing messages ranging from “Say no to tyranny” to “Facts not fear” and “Live Free or Die Trying.”
Most in the crowd, especially near the residence’s gates, did not practice social distancing as recommended by state and federal health authorities. A few protesters wore masks; most didn’t.
The atmosphere was raucous but mostly tame, though there were some confrontational moments at the edges. At one point, a man walked down the Summit Avenue bike path with his middle fingers hoisted in the air. Another man followed close behind shouting, “Spit on me, boy! Spit on me!”
Don Vergin, a 67-year-old retired postal worker, drove hours Friday morning from the western Minnesota town of Benson to join the protest.
“I’m concerned about people losing their jobs and losing their homes,” Vergin said. “I came here because I want to support speeding up the reopening of Minnesota.”
Vergin said his son was unemployed before the virus outbreak. “He’s looking for work, but this makes it so much harder.” Vergin was carrying an American flag and a handmade sign that read, “All Businesses are Essential.”
Minnesota Libertarian Party Chairman Chris Holbrook held two of the flags that were common in the crowd — “Don’t Tread on Me” and the American flag. “I’m pleased with the turnout. I’m also disappointed it’s a little more of a Trump rally than I thought,” Holbrook said of the protest, adding, “It’s not as bad as that one in Michigan looked like.”
Despite the pushback against the business closures, rally organizers said they would encourage participants to take whatever safety measures they wanted — whether that be social distancing, remaining in their cars or wearing protective equipment.
“I will be wearing a mask,” said Huizenga, a construction manager and past candidate for Minnesota Senate. “You can make people aware of the risks, you can get the information out there, everything they’re doing now,” he added. “But then you let the market respond collectively, and people can figure out for themselves what are the proper precautions. We just think it’s not government’s role to dictate such a severe response.”"

Tim Walz cautions that moves to allow more crowds, activities will be gradual ones","Amid increasing calls to remove restrictions on more businesses, Gov. Tim Walz said changes will be made gradually, such as Friday’s order to open up golf courses, shooting ranges and other outdoor activities.
Minnesota’s stay-at-home order expires May 4, part of an effort to reduce social interactions by 80%, giving time for the health care system to secure more beds, ventilators, masks and other equipment, as well as staff, in hopes of containing the spread of COVID-19.
Walz said it would be impractical to maintain stay-at-home until a vaccine is developed ­— which could take at least 18 months — but said social distancing will become the norm no matter how many restrictions are lifted and when.
That means events with big crowds, such as a ballgame at Target Field, or bars and restaurants or backyard parties that draw a large number of people, are not likely to come back soon.
“The things we want probably more than anything … are going to be some of the last things we will bring back on,” Walz said.
While the debate about stay-at-home continues, Minnesota on Friday reported some of the largest one-day increases in confirmed cases and deaths.
Another 159 people tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Minnesota Health Department.
With the new cases, Minnesota has passed the 2,000 mark for the first time and now has a total of 2,071 coronavirus infections. Ten days ago, the state had 1,069 cases.
Seventeen more Minnesotans have died, bringing the total number of fatalities in the state to 111.
Although the one-day total of deaths is the largest ever, it could include deaths that occurred over the past several days, as there can be a lag time in reporting and verifying the death records.
Twelve of the 17 deaths were among residents of long-term care facilities, which have been hit hard. So far, 123 nursing home or assisted living facilities have at least one case, although about half have just one.
All but two of the deaths reported Friday were in people above age 70, with the others in their 60s.
Pork plant cluster
State health officials reported a cluster of cases at the JBS pork plant in Worthington. The outbreak was discovered after COVID-19 testing Thursday found a jump in cases in Nobles County, bringing the total there to 30.
Walz acknowledged that the JBS outbreak and future outbreaks could be prevented had there been more testing for COVID-19.
But a shortage of supplies has hampered testing efforts across the nation.
The University of Minnesota, Hennepin Healthcare and the Mayo Clinic are launching ambitious efforts to broaden testing availability, including new tests that detect antibodies, an indication that someone who has been infected with the coronavirus has recovered.
“If antibodies are detected it indicates that the person has been affected by the virus in the past and may have some protection,” said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director at the Health Department.
But because COVID-19 is so new — it first emerged in December — researchers are unclear how long immunity protection will last and how many antibodies a person will need to fight off reinfection.
“For some diseases like measles, protection is lifelong,” Ehresmann said. “For other diseases, protection is limited.”
That uncertainty adds another wrinkle to the question of who should be allowed to travel in the community with few restrictions, even if they test positive for the disease antibodies.
Minnesota Senate Republicans contend that restrictions should be lifted because Minnesotans have helped the health care system prepare.
“We need to trust our citizens, churches, nonprofits and business owners to operate in a safe manner following all of the CDC guidelines,” said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake. “The stay-at-home order is achieving its goal of preparing for a surge and now it’s time to save our economy and way of life.”
The Senate Republican Caucus said it has received more than 1,600 suggestions two days after opening an online portal soliciting ideas about reopening the economy.
Going to snowball
To bolster the case for Walz’s stay-at-home order, two health care leaders appeared with him during Friday’s daily media briefing.
North Memorial Health Hospital’s intensive care units are gradually starting to fill up, said Mary Turner, a medical intensive care nurse and president of the Minnesota Nurses Association.
Patients needing ventilators to help with breathing can remain on the unit for weeks.
“Just when we think they are going to get better and we take out the tube, we have to put it back in,” Turner said. “This terrible virus attacks not only the respiratory system, it is attacking the heart, it is attacking the kidneys. It is spreading throughout the whole body.”
Nurses store masks and other protective equipment in bags that hang on the walls.
“We are rationing and we are being careful with it,” Turner said.
Two of the hospital’s four intensive care units are nearly full and she expects the others will be soon.
“It is going to start snowballing faster and faster,” Turner said. “They are all going to be full.”
Dr. John Hick, an emergency physician at Hennepin Healthcare who is advising the state on health care preparedness, said progress has been made but more is needed.
“From a supply standpoint we continue to operate in a scarcity situation,” he said. “We’ve bought time … to support building out a plan for accommodating a surge of COVID-19 patients.”
The state’s emergency departments have seen a sharp decline in the number of patients, which could mean that people are deferring needed medical care.
“We are very concerned that people may be too fearful to come into the emergency department,” Hick said. “The emergency care system is there for you all the time.”"
"April 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-money-race-cash-flows-in-state-federal-campaigns/569764242/,StarTribune,"Minnesota money race: Cash flows in state, federal campaigns","Campaign cash continued to flow in Minnesota in the opening three months of the 2020 election year.
Fundraising reports for federal candidates were due April 15. The quarterly cash reports are closely watched by political handicappers and donors looking to gauge candidates' strength.
As is often the case, most incumbents maintained a cash advantage both in money raised and cash on hand. Dan Feehan, a Democrat running a rematch against GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn in southern Minnesota's First Congressional District, is the only challenger who ended March with a bigger bank account than his incumbent rival.
The fundraising quarter, which spanned Jan. 1 to March 31, included the first few weeks of coronavirus-related slowdowns and eventual shutdowns. The change has already had an effect.
DFL Party Chairman Ken Martin said it ""created a huge financial crunch for everyone in politics ... particularly challengers."" Those pressures will likely be more apparent in the next round of filings, due in mid-July. Martin said the state party could see a 75% revenue drop.
""The second quarter of this year is going to be the most difficult and challenging for the state party,"" he said. ""Everyone's tightening their belt.""
State fundraising heats up
It's not just federal races attracting cash. The year's first updates from state-level candidates and committees were also due last week. With no statewide offices up for a vote, all eyes will be on the battle for control of the Minnesota Legislature.
Similar to the federal dynamic, the caucuses in power maintained an overall fundraising edge. The Senate Victory Fund, working to protect the GOP's narrow majority in the upper chamber, ended the quarter with more than $2.2 million on hand, compared with $647,000 in the Senate DFL Caucus account. The House DFL, meanwhile, has $1.1 million available and the House GOP has $487,000.
Minority parties in both chambers outraised their opposing caucus. House Republicans took in about $364,000 over three months, about $37,000 more than DFL rivals. The Senate DFL Caucus took in $645,000 — close to double that of the Senate GOP — thanks in large part to more than $300,000 in transfers from the state DFL Party.
Franken spreads the cash
Former U.S. Sen. Al Franken is still spending down his Midwestern Values Leadership PAC. But in addition to paying for consultants and travel related to his ongoing political work, the Minnesota Democrat is increasing his political contributions.
Franken donated $5,000 to Mississippi U.S. Senate candidate Mike Espy and another $50,000 to Win Minnesota, a PAC supporting Democrats.
Former lawmakers are allowed by law to use such funds in this way. A Franken spokesman previously told the Star Tribune that the PAC ""will be fully engaged in helping Democrats in 2020."""
"April 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/as-governors-battle-trump-over-pandemic-walz-plays-minnesota-nice/569772672/,StarTribune,"As governors battle Trump over pandemic, Walz plays Minnesota nice","President Donald Trump said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker is “always complaining” after he criticized the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s frequent criticism of Trump’s “slow” response earned her the nickname “Gretchen ‘Half’ Whitmer.”
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told the president the nation needed a “Tom Brady” not a “backup quarterback” in addressing the global pandemic. A day later, Trump referred to Inslee as a “failed presidential candidate” who is “constantly chirping.”
Those governors, all Democrats, have been outspoken in their criticism of Trump amid frustrations over a lack of testing kits and personal protective equipment. But in Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz, also a Democrat, has held back, toeing a fine line between pushing his own administration’s response to the pandemic while not criticizing Trump’s.
“I can only make a judgment as governor that I believe is in the best interest, the health and safety of Minnesotans and stick with that,” Walz said during a recent coronavirus press briefing. “I certainly … have not had open clashes with the administration. We’ve worked together, we have been grateful for the work we are doing together.”
Walz, a first-term governor and former member of Congress, has taken actions that go far beyond any push from the federal government. He’s used executive emergency powers to close down schools, businesses and most public places and asked Minnesotans to stay home unless absolutely necessary. But his relationship with the federal government has also never been more important, as states compete for a limited number of supplies to respond to the coronavirus.
In states where governors have pushed back, like Washington and Michigan, Trump has dangled the prospect of withholding federal aid. He told Vice President Mike Pence, a former governor of Indiana who has been leading the administration’s response to the virus, not to return their calls. “You know what I say? If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call,” Trump said.
“Given how vindictive the president is toward some of the other governors who seem to be giving him a hard time publicly, Governor Walz is doing exactly what he should, which is maximize what he can get for Minnesota,” said former DFL Gov. Mark Dayton, whose time in office overlapped two years with the Trump administration. “The extent that that’s influenced at all by the relationships that the governor has with the president, the vice president and with others, that becomes a critical variable.”
So far, Walz’s approach has been more Minnesota nice: avoiding direct confrontation while also signaling frustrations. He has voiced concerns about the lack of testing kits, masks and ventilators flowing to states, saying he wished the federal government would fully utilize the Defense Production Act, a wartime law that allows the government to direct industrial production.
At times, he’s had to directly contradict the message coming from the White House, suggesting it was “not helpful” when the president initially said he wanted to reopen businesses by Easter. But he did not mention Trump by name.
In return, Trump hasn’t issued blistering attacks on Walz like he has other governors, commenting on Minnesota’s stay-at-home order for the first time Friday to coincide with lockdown protests at the governor’s residence. “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” Trump tweeted, issuing identical tweets about protests planned in other states. Walz said he called Trump directly to ask what the state should be doing differently to put people back to work and not compromise their health. He didn’t get a response, Walz said.
“I just don’t have time to try to figure out why something like that would happen,” he said. “I just have to lead from Minnesota’s perspective.”
While former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty disagreed politically with Democratic President Barack Obama, he was careful about his messaging as the federal government doled out stimulus relief during the recession, said Tom Hanson, who led the effort under Pawlenty.
“Even Governor Pawlenty was circumspect about criticizing the president when we are trying to accept and administer these programs that people need,” he said. “I was aware of it at the time, and wanted to make sure we did nothing to complicate things at the federal level.”
But behind the scenes, Walz has also been working with governors of six Midwestern states with stay-at-home orders to create a regional plan, announced last week, to reopen the economy. They’re following the lead of governors in the Northeast and on the West Coast, who are also banding together, a move Trump initially suggested in a tweet amounted to “mutiny.”
For citizens, the pandemic has been a rushed civics lesson on executive power, featuring public spats between state executives and the commander in chief of the nation over who has the final authority on decisions like opening and closing businesses during a public health crisis. At one point, Trump said the president has “ultimate authority,” but in a call with governors last week, his tone shifted, announcing new federal guidelines to help states lift social-distancing measures. He told the governors, “You are going to call your own shots.”
Walz doesn’t gain anything politically by attacking a president who nearly won Minnesota four years ago, said University of Minnesota political science professor Kathryn Pearson. And it could hurt his ability to continue work with a divided state Legislature.
“He’s very solution-oriented about what’s best for Minnesota without also using his bully pulpit to blast the president,” Pearson said. “There’s nothing helpful about that for him in terms of political support from Republicans in his own state, both leaders and the public, and there’s nothing to be gained in terms of substantive resources.”"
"April 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/after-call-with-gov-walz-trump-signals-fast-help-on-the-way-to-minnesota/569790072/,StarTribune,"After call with Gov. Walz, Trump signals 'fast' help on the way to Minnesota","In the span of 72 hours on his Twitter feed, President Donald Trump went from cheering on Minnesotans protesting a stay-at-home executive order to praising a call he had with Gov. Tim Walz and promising to get the Democratic governor ""all he needs, and fast"" to respond to coronavirus.
The tweets mark the first time Trump has weighed in on Minnesota's coronavirus response and leadership, and his tone toward Walz is a departure from the more combative public relationship he's had with other governors in Michigan, New York and Washington.
""Received a very nice call from @GovTimWalz of Minnesota,"" Trump tweeted Monday. ""We are working closely on getting him all he needs, and fast. Good things happening!""
The turnaround happened over the weekend, following a tweet from Trump Friday to ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA,"" adopting the slogan of hundreds of protesters who gathered at Walz's St. Paul home to oppose an order to stay home unless absolutely necessary to limit the spread of the virus. After the tweet Friday, Walz said he called the president and vice president to ask what they thought he should be doing differently to safely open the state back up.
Trump returned that call Saturday night, Walz said, and they talked for 10 minutes about the state's stay-at-home order, challenges with testing capacity and struggles to get enough personal protective equipment. He said he left that conversation feeling that the state and federal response to the virus were aligned.
""I'm not interested in adjudicating why we don't have these things now, I'm just interested in how we get them. That's what I expressed to the president,"" Walz said. ""He echoed that and expressed great desire to work with us.""
In the past, Walz has signaled frustrations about the limited number of tests flowing to states, but he's been careful not to directly criticize the president by name. Governors like Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, Jay Inslee in Washington and J.B. Pritzker in Illinois have been more openly critical of the president's response and have been the subject of blistering attacks from Trump in return. In some cases, Trump has suggested he won't return their calls because of the attacks.
Walz said Monday that he doesn't think that approach is useful. ""Minnesotans and Americans, in general, they don't need to see us fight,"" he said.
The tweet is also the first sign that help for Minnesota could be on the way from the federal government, as the state competes with others for critical testing supplies, protective gear for healthcare workers and ventilators for hospitals.
The governor said he believes prominent business leaders from Minnesota put in calls to the president and said ""talk to the governor, he's trying to get this right.""
""The president said I'm hearing from friends in Minnesota that you're doing things that need to be done and you're listening to them,"" Walz said.
The call caps a tumultuous few weeks between governors and the administration, including a debate over who has authority to decide when to reopen shuttered businesses. Last week, Trump rolled out new guidelines to help states lift social-distancing measures. He told the governors: ""You are going to call your own shots."""
"April 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/walz-business-disruptions-could-last-18-months/569806402/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz: Business disruptions could last 18 months,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz warned Monday that social distancing practices brought on by the growing COVID-19 epidemic are likely to disrupt business in the state for a year or more no matter when his administration lifts its contested stay-at-home orders.
Speaking after meetings with state business leaders — as well as a conciliatory phone call with President Donald Trump — Walz said stores, restaurants and other public places will long have to adapt to public concerns about the coronavirus, likely until there’s an effective vaccine.
“I think most of these retailers and businesses understand they’re going to have to change the way business is being done for about the next 18 months,” Walz said. “They’re going to have to do that regardless of what a stay-at-home order looks like because people are naturally understanding that we’re going to have to social distance because their shopping and their retail buying experience is going to change dramatically.”
Walz has previously indicated that he plans to reopen business in stages as safety measures dictate.
Walz’s remarks followed a tweet from Trump signaling an apparent truce with the DFL governor over his current stay-at-home order, which runs until May 4.
“Received a very nice call from @GovTimWalz of Minnesota,” Trump tweeted Monday. “We are working closely on getting him all he needs, and fast. Good things happening!”
The president’s overture represented a turnaround from Friday, when he tweeted “LIBERATE MINNESOTA,” adopting the slogan of hundreds of protesters who gathered at Walz’s St. Paul home to oppose an order to stay home unless absolutely necessary. After the tweet Friday, Walz said he called the president and vice president to ask what they thought he should be doing differently to safely open the state back up.

“I’m not interested in adjudicating why we don’t have these things now, I’m just interested in how we get them. That’s what I expressed to the president,” Walz said. “He echoed that and expressed great desire to work with us.”
While Walz said he saw no “percentage” in battling the president, their call came amid deepening political fissures over on how — and how fast — Minnesota should ease state-ordered business closures meant to slow the spread of the virus.
Partisan tensions flared again at the State Capitol Monday as Republicans raised new doubts about the modeling guiding the governor’s decision and legislators feuded over how to handle the final four weeks of the session.
After a month of a reduced floor schedule due to coronavirus, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, announced last week that the upper chamber would return to a “new normal” of meeting in person every three days. The move was criticized by Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, DFL-Woodbury, who released a letter to Gazelka raising “serious concerns” about plans for more frequent floor sessions.
We “trust that your highest priority is the health and safety [of] both legislators and staff and our role in spreading the disease among our communities,” Kent wrote. “Consequently, Senate floor sessions should only be called when the work being conducted is of the highest priority and relevant.”
Gazelka said that he too acknowledges that COVID-19 is not likely to go away for at least a year but that the long timeline for a full containment of the virus is even more reason to be “willing to move forward sooner than later” on reopening more business.
“It’s not going to be easy until either there’s a vaccine or there’s herd immunity where enough people have gotten the virus and overcome it,” he said. “That’s why I talk about being willing to face this.”
He said he worries about the lasting impact a prolonged stay-at-home order could have on small businesses, including resorts and retail shops. “They need to be open to survive and I think the consequences right now are dire,” he said. “If we don’t move and open them up pretty soon, they’re not going to open.”
Republican Sen. Michelle Benson, who chairs a key Senate Health Committee, noted that an alternative scenario mapped by state and University of Minnesota epidemiologists projects a similar number of deaths and ICU cases under a more tailored stay-at-home approach.
“There’s an argument to be made we could have businesses start opening the spigot on economic activity, start opening things up slowly and thoughtfully, provide shelter in place for those most vulnerable and have the same outcomes for ICU capacity and mortality as the [option] the governor has chosen, which keeps us sheltered in place much longer,” she said.
Benson said Monday she believes it is also time for the state to allow some elective medical procedures to resume. She said the current ban has resulted in plummeting revenue for providers and discomfort for patients. “This needs to be done step by step so we don’t get ahead of ourselves, form a big wave and then re-shut down things that are open,” she said.
Walz, meanwhile, sought to defuse partisan tensions over the business closures, which he acknowledged have been painful in terms of lost jobs and income. He talked earlier in the day with members of the Minnesota Business Partnership and Best Buy chief executive Corie Barry, whose company has announced plans to furlough some 51,000 hourly workers.
As part of his daily press briefing, Walz was joined by Ecolab chief executive Doug Baker to discuss ways the business community can help the state procure personal protective equipment and strengthen the response to COVID-19.
“Clearly these are difficult decisions,” Baker said. “We empathize and we also really appreciate all the hard work that’s been going into this.”
Walz spent about 15 minutes speaking with 95 Minnesota CEOs led by Charlie Weaver, president of the Minnesota Business Partnership.
“We may never get back,” Weaver said of any “new normal.” “I believe that we’re never going to get back to the way it was before. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Every company is changing and learning as a result of this in terms of how they’re going to operate.”
Weaver said the group doesn’t dispute the governor’s assessment of how long it might take to recover.
“I think he recognizes that this is a disaster from an economic standpoint and we’ve got to try to get people back,” Weaver said. “When they do get back, I think 18 months is a good timeline for how long it’s going to take to acquaint businesses and small businesses to the new normal.”
Weaver said Monday’s call covered plans to devise protocols for easing restrictions on businesses. Walz told the CEOs that his administration planned to “move as quickly as we can and as safely as we can,” Weaver said.
Testing also factored heavily into the call, Weaver said, as most CEOs want to be able to test workers or, in the case of restaurants, potential diners. Weaver described the governor as “guardedly optimistic.”"
"April 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/cities-scramble-and-worry-as-budgets-take-hits-from-the-virus/569821342/,StarTribune,Minnesota cities scramble as budgets take hits from the virus,"The coronavirus pandemic is opening giant holes in city and county budgets in Minnesota and across the country, choking tax revenue and forcing officials to weigh layoffs and deep service cuts.
Officials in Bloomington, home of the temporarily shuttered Mall of America, learned this week that they are facing a budget shortfall of more than 20%.
Roseville has furloughed nearly four dozen seasonal and part-time workers as parks and ice arenas remain closed. In Duluth, officials have started dipping into the city’s $10 million reserve fund and face a shortfall of up to $25 million.
“So much is unknown,” said Bradley Peterson, executive director of the Coalition of Greater Minnesota Cities. “That’s what is fueling the anxiety.”
Local officials also are facing unexpected new costs, such as the urgent need for new technology for staffers working at home and protective gear for those who must stay at the office.
A survey released last week by the National League of Cities found that more than 2,100 cities across the country expect budget shortfalls and anticipate having to cut programs and staffers. Officials in nearly half those cities said they likely will have to cut public safety departments.
“We hope the state and federal government will come up some sort of relief plans for cities,” said Bloomington City Manager Jamie Verbrugge. “But we recognize hope is not a plan.”
Some help may be on the horizon. Sen. Roger Chamberlain, R-Lino Lakes, who chairs the Senate Tax Committee, said a $300 million package is in the works to provide tax cuts and business incentives. House Tax Chairman Rep. Paul Marquart, DFL-Dilworth, added that he might consider a recovery package for cities toward the end of the session.
Meanwhile, Congress recently approved $150 billion in aid to states to be used to help local governments to respond to the pandemic.
As layoffs mount and businesses struggle for survival, local officials are trying to ease the burden for taxpayers while honoring their financial commitments. On Tuesday, the boards for both Hennepin and Ramsey counties joined a growing list of counties that won’t penalize residents for delaying property tax payments for up to two months.
But that in turn could strain cities’ ability to make bond debt payments that are due in August. If the economy worsens and residents can’t pay their taxes, it could create significant budget problems in Minneapolis, said city spokesperson Sarah McKenzie.
The state’s largest cities are expected to experience some of the greatest financial hardships. In Minneapolis, officials predicted revenue will drop by as much as $200 million, or nearly 12%, depending on the duration of the pandemic.
St. Paul officials said the city could be facing potential losses of up to 70% in revenue directly affected by the pandemic, such as hotel and sales taxes.
No city, whatever its size, is immune. Budget gaps are growing the longer recreation centers and ice skating rinks are closed. Fees from building permits and utilities are shrinking. Firefighter hires and new snowplow purchases are on hold as city leaders grapple with Gov. Tim Walz’s stay-at-home order, which could stretch well into the summer.
Cities are examining the virus’ financial impact in three budget categories, said Peterson, with the Coalition of Greater Minnesota Cities: unplanned expenses for equipment to allow employees to work at home and overtime for first responders; lost revenue from sales and lodging taxes, fees and facility closures; and the long-term ability of businesses to bounce back.
The latter, Peterson said, “is causing the most anxiety.”
The coalition sent out a survey last month to cities for a first impression of the virus’ impact. Nearly 100 responded, and 70% said they anticipate collecting less in property taxes.
Little Falls Mayor Greg Zylka said he worries about downtown businesses that are struggling, including restaurants, shops, a bakery. At the same time, some needs have to be met. Little Falls recently advanced its quarterly funding for the city-owned Pine Grove Zoo to make up for lost attendance dollars. “They still have to feed the animals,” Zylka said.
Metro suburbs are looking for ways to absorb their losses.
Woodbury has delayed the filling of 300 temporary and seasonal positions, Eagan has laid off 100 part-time workers, and Roseville has furloughed 45 seasonal and part-time parks and recreation workers. Suburbs that own sports centers are taking a hit at a time when they would ordinarily be busy with athletic tryouts. Savage has lost $100,000 on its sports dome, and West St. Paul is down $270,000 in ice arena and sports dome revenue.
Brooklyn Park Mayor Jeff Lunde said city officials are looking at cutting expenses. “Are we going to buy that big new snowplow for $150,000 or can we wait a year?” he said.
Bloomington officials said the city may have to delay capital projects, leave jobs vacant or dip into its reserve fund.
“Most people expect a well-run government to have a rainy-day fund,” said Verbrugge, Bloomington’s city manager. “But it’s only good if the rain stops.”"

The FDA on Tuesday morning e-mailed a MedWatch safety alert saying that while the agency will continue reviewing data from test-makers, it doesn’t expect that an antibody test alone “can be shown to definitively diagnose or exclude” the viral infection. Such test results need to be judged in the context of patient history, including the timing of symptoms and exposures and the results of other tests.
COVID-19 is a viral illness that causes the body’s immune system to produce special proteins called antibodies to fight off infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus discovered in Wuhan, China, late last year.
An accurate antibody test could be a major tool to end stay-at-home orders like the one in place in Minnesota, because it would theoretically identify people who have immunity to the novel coronavirus. Researchers have not yet figured out how long COVID-19 antibodies protect those who have them, nor how accurate the tests to detect them are.
“Determining the next steps in our response to COVID-19 is partly dependent on an accurate assessment of our national efforts thus far, and the quality of data for making this decision is dependent on accurate testing products,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement.
The FDA said it is collaborating with the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to establish performance assessments of antibody tests at the NIH, including tests already on the market and others still under development.
Few details were available as of Tuesday. The NIH confirmed that the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, which has expertise in antibody testing because of past work with the human papillomavirus, is validating COVID-19 antibody tests with the FDA.
The FDA said the results of the NIH’s performance assessments may help determine whether tests should receive emergency-use authorizations in the U.S. However, the FDA has also loosened its normal restrictions on how tests get to market, as it tries to balance the need for more testing against the risk of using tests backed by scant evidence of accuracy.
FDA guidelines published in March say companies can sell COVID-19 antibody tests without any authorization or review from the FDA. But the test-maker must do several things first: validate the test internally; tell the FDA about the test; and include disclaimers saying the test is not FDA-approved and cannot be used to definitively rule out COVID-19 infection.
Diagnosing the novel disease is difficult, partly because of its confusing symptom presentation. Many people with COVID-19 experience fever, coughing and shortness of breath, but some don’t, even 14 days after exposure.
In general, the virus seems to cause mild or no symptoms in roughly 80% of cases, while 5% of cases may require critical care in a hospital. But those estimates are based on confirmed cases. Some researchers think the rate of symptomatic cases may be much lower, but it’s impossible to tell without widespread, accurate antibody testing.
There are two major types of tests for COVID-19, molecular and serological. Molecular tests were the first to be developed in the U.S., and they are designed to react to the presence of viral genetic code. They can detect the virus earlier in the course of disease, doctors say, but may be vulnerable to missing cases because of imperfections with nasal or throat specimens.
Serological tests look for antibodies in blood samples. COVID-19 antibodies aren’t thought to be detectable in the blood until 13 or 14 days after onset of symptoms, which typically don’t appear until after an initial incubation period of two to seven days from initial exposure, Mayo Clinic researcher Elitza Theel said.
There’s strong commercial interest in developing “point-of-care” antibody tests capable of delivering a result while the patient waits. At least 90 are under development and some have been submitted to the FDA to get emergency-use authorization based on initial validation testing done by the manufacturers.
But researchers like Theel say there’s a risk that rapid antibody tests could be used too soon in patient care, which could cause negative readings in people who have actually been exposed to the virus.
“The vast majority of individuals are going to be negative if you test them too soon with a serological assay,” Theel said."
"April 22, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/what-i-learned-during-10-days-of-treating-covid-pneumonia/569857042/,StarTribune,What I learned during 10 days of treating COVID pneumonia,"I have been practicing emergency medicine for 30 years. In 1994, I invented an imaging system for teaching intubation, the procedure of inserting breathing tubes. This led me to perform research into this procedure, and subsequently teach airway procedure courses to physicians worldwide for the last two decades.
So at the end of March, as a crush of COVID-19 patients began overwhelming hospitals in New York City, I volunteered to spend 10 days at Bellevue, helping at the hospital where I trained. Over those days, I realized that we are not detecting the deadly pneumonia the virus causes early enough and that we could be doing more to keep patients off ventilators — and alive.
On the long drive to New York from my home in New Hampshire, I called my friend Nick Caputo, an emergency physician in the Bronx, who was already in the thick of it. I wanted to know what I was facing, how to stay safe and about his insights into airway management with this disease. “Rich,” he said, “it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.”
He was right. Pneumonia caused by the coronavirus has had a stunning impact on the city’s hospital system. Normally an ER has a mix of patients with conditions ranging from the serious, such as heart attacks, strokes and traumatic injuries, to the non-life-threatening, such as minor lacerations, intoxication, orthopedic injuries and migraine headaches.
During my recent time at Bellevue, though, almost all the ER patients had COVID pneumonia. Within the first hour of my first shift I inserted breathing tubes into two patients.
Even patients without respiratory complaints had COVID pneumonia. The patient stabbed in the shoulder, whom we X-rayed because we worried he had a collapsed lung, actually had COVID pneumonia. In patients on whom we did CT scans because they were injured in falls, we coincidentally found COVID pneumonia. Elderly patients who had passed out for unknown reasons and a number of diabetic patients were found to have it.
And here is what really surprised us: These patients did not report any sensation of breathing problems, even though their chest X-rays showed diffuse pneumonia and their oxygen was below normal. How could this be?
We are just beginning to recognize that COVID pneumonia initially causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call “silent hypoxia” — “silent” because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature.
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with fluid or pus. Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. But when COVID pneumonia first strikes, patients don’t feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays). Normal oxygen saturation for most people at sea level is 94% to 100%; COVID pneumonia patients I saw had oxygen saturations as low as 50%.
To my amazement, most patients I saw said they had been sick for a week or so with fever, cough, upset stomach and fatigue, but they only became short of breath the day they came to the hospital. Their pneumonia had clearly been going on for days, but by the time they felt they had to go to the hospital, they were often already in critical condition.
In emergency departments we insert breathing tubes in critically ill patients for a variety of reasons. In my 30 years of practice, however, most patients requiring emergency intubation are in shock, have altered mental status or are grunting to breathe. Patients requiring intubation because of acute hypoxia are often unconscious or using every muscle they can to take a breath. They are in extreme duress. COVID pneumonia cases are very different.
A vast majority of COVID pneumonia patients I met had remarkably low oxygen saturations at triage — seemingly incompatible with life — but they were using their cellphones as we put them on monitors. Although breathing fast, they had relatively minimal apparent distress, despite dangerously low oxygen levels and terrible pneumonia on chest X-rays.
We are only just beginning to understand why this is so. The coronavirus attacks lung cells that make surfactant. This substance helps keep the air sacs in the lungs stay open between breaths and is critical to normal lung function. As the inflammation from COVID pneumonia starts, it causes the air sacs to collapse, and oxygen levels fall. Yet the lungs initially remain “compliant,” not yet stiff or heavy with fluid. This means patients can still expel carbon dioxide — and without a buildup of carbon dioxide, patients do not feel short of breath.
Patients compensate for the low oxygen in their blood by breathing faster and deeper — and this happens without their realizing it. This silent hypoxia, and the patient’s physiological response to it, causes even more inflammation and more air sacs to collapse, and the pneumonia worsens until their oxygen levels plummet. In effect, the patient is injuring their own lungs by breathing harder and harder. Twenty percent of COVID pneumonia patients then go on to a second and deadlier phase of lung injury. Fluid builds up and the lungs become stiff, carbon dioxide rises, and patients develop acute respiratory failure.
By the time patients have noticeable trouble breathing and present to the hospital with dangerously low oxygen levels, many will ultimately require a ventilator.
Silent hypoxia progressing rapidly to respiratory failure explains cases of COVID-19 patients dying suddenly after not feeling short of breath. (It appears that most COVID-19 patients experience relatively mild symptoms and get over the illness in a week or two without treatment.)
A major reason this pandemic is straining our health system is the alarming severity of lung injury patients have when they arrive in emergency rooms. COVID-19 overwhelmingly kills through the lungs. And because so many patients are not going to the hospital until their pneumonia is already well-advanced, many wind up on ventilators, causing shortages of the machines. And once on ventilators, many die.
Avoiding the use of a ventilator is a huge win for both patient and the health care system. The resources needed for patients on ventilators are staggering. Vented patients require multiple sedatives so that they don’t buck the vent or accidentally remove their breathing tubes; they need intravenous and arterial lines, IV medicines and IV pumps. In addition to a tube in the trachea, they have tubes in their stomach and bladder. Teams of people are required to move each patient, turning them on their stomach and then their back, twice a day to improve lung function.
There is a way we could identify more patients who have COVID pneumonia sooner and treat them more effectively — and it would not require waiting for a coronavirus test at a hospital or doctor’s office. It requires detecting silent hypoxia early through a common medical device that can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies: a pulse oximeter.
Pulse oximetry is no more complicated than using a thermometer. These small devices turn on with one button and are placed on a fingertip. In a few seconds, two numbers are displayed: oxygen saturation and pulse rate. Pulse oximeters are extremely reliable in detecting oxygenation problems and elevated heart rates.
Pulse oximeters helped save the lives of two emergency physicians I know, alerting them early on to the need for treatment. When they noticed their oxygen levels declining, both went to the hospital and recovered (though one waited longer and required more treatment). Detection of hypoxia, early treatment and close monitoring apparently also worked for Boris Johnson, the British prime minister.
Widespread pulse oximetry screening for COVID pneumonia — whether people check themselves on home devices or go to clinics or doctors’ offices — could provide an early warning system for the kinds of breathing problems associated with COVID pneumonia.
People using the devices at home would want to consult with their doctors to reduce the number of people who come to the ER unnecessarily because they misinterpret their device. There also may be some patients who have unrecognized chronic lung problems and have borderline or slightly low oxygen saturations unrelated to COVID-19. All patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus should have pulse oximetry monitoring for two weeks, the period during which COVID pneumonia typically develops. All people with cough, fatigue and fevers should also have pulse oximeter monitoring even if they have not had virus testing, or even if their swab test was negative, because those tests are only about 70% accurate. A vast majority of Americans who have been exposed to the virus don’t know it.
There are other things we can do as well to avoid immediately resorting to intubation and a ventilator. Patient positioning maneuvers (having patients lie on their stomach and sides) opens up the lower and posterior lungs most affected in COVID pneumonia. Oxygenation and positioning helped patients breathe easier and seemed to prevent progression of the disease in many cases. In a preliminary study by Dr. Caputo, this strategy helped keep three out of four patients with advanced COVID pneumonia from needing a ventilator in the first 24 hours.
To date, COVID-19 has killed more than 40,000 people nationwide — more than 10,000 in New York state alone. Oximeters are not 100% accurate, and they are not a panacea. There will be deaths and bad outcomes that are not preventable. We don’t fully understand why certain patients get so sick, or why some go on to develop multi-organ failure. Many elderly people, already weak with chronic illness, and those with underlying lung disease do very poorly with COVID pneumonia, despite aggressive treatment.
But we can do better. Right now, many emergency rooms are either being crushed by this one disease or waiting for it to hit. We must direct resources to identifying and treating the initial phase of COVID pneumonia earlier by screening for silent hypoxia."
"April 22, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/end-u-s-review-and-restore-funding-to-world-health-organization/569869912/,StarTribune,End U.S. 'review' and restore funding to World Health Organization,"President Donald Trump’s response to the spread of the coronavirus will be dissected and debated for decades to come. Making a scapegoat of the World Health Organization (WHO) during a global pandemic already stands out as one of his worst decisions.
In the midst of the deadliest outbreak in a century, the president has suspended U.S. contributions to the group most likely to stand sentinel on where, how fast and how lethally COVID-19 is spreading across the 195 nations in the world. A traveling virus heeds no borders.
Trump’s dumbfounding resolve to starve the WHO of money, pending further review, appears to be a product of blame-shifting that will cost countless lives, at home and abroad. The president has falsely accused WHO officials of missing the severity and extent of the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak in China late last year.
“Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China’s lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,” Trump said. “Instead, the WHO willingly took China’s assurances to face value.”
The facts show otherwise. WHO publicly sounded the alarm of the Chinese epidemic on Jan. 5.
Fresh reporting shows that more than a dozen U.S. physicians, researchers and health experts were transmitting real-time information about the Chinese epidemic to the White House as early as late last year. Trump’s allegation of a WHO coverup is all the more preposterous considering that the president himself spent weeks praising Beijing’s handling of the crisis.
From Jan. 22 to Feb. 29, Trump on 15 occasions gave public tribute to the Chinese for their response to the spread of COVID-19, according to Politico.
“China seems to be making tremendous progress,” Trump said in late February. “Their numbers are way down. … I think our relationship with China is very good. We just did a big trade deal. We’re starting on another trade deal with China — a very big one. And we’ve been working very closely. They’ve been talking to our people, we’ve been talking to their people, having to do with the virus.”
A 72-year-old institution, the WHO first was created to combat the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in the industrial and developing world. It has no power to direct public health decisions, but acts as a sort of Central Intelligence Agency standing guard — and offering advice and aid — when epidemics emerge.
The U.S. contributes more than any other country, about 20% of WHO’s $2.4 billion annual budget.
To be sure, the WHO’s performance in the face of epidemics has not always been perfect.
During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, it failed to act on information, was slow to challenge government coverups and declared a public health emergency after the epidemic was well underway.
But WHO’s sounding an emergency in the Chinese outbreak of the coronavirus merits no reproach.
The Trump administration should wrap up its “review” of the WHO and assure that more financial aid will be on the way. This is no time to close the eyes and cover the ears of a world watchdog over deadly disease."

News of the April 28 trip came hours after Gov. Tim Walz announced a “moon shot” plan to partner with Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota to ramp up virus testing in the state. Mayo’s national reference laboratory has already conducted 120,000 molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19 nationwide.
Pence cited Minnesota’s “breakthrough” at a White House briefing on Thursday as an example of state-level progress on testing. The vice president said the efforts will be discussed during a Friday conference call with all the nation’s governors.
The Mayo trip will be the vice president’s second visit to Minnesota related to the coronavirus crisis. Pence, who leads the White House Corona­virus Task Force, traveled to 3M World Headquarters in early March. The Maplewood company manufactures protective masks used by health care workers."

The National Guard was called in to help when the number of election judges for the April 7 primary dwindled as COVID-19 cases increased.
Just before the primary, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin blocked efforts by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to delay the election because of the coronavirus pandemic and provide mail ballots to all voters. Then the U.S. Supreme Court reversed his order to extend the absentee ballot deadline.
So hundreds of thousands of voters still showed up at Wisconsin polling places because the election was important to them. But being dedicated citizens shouldn’t have meant risking their health and those around them.
Minnesota needs to learn from its neighbor to the east and take steps that ensure residents’ right to vote without putting public health at risk. Secretary of State Steve Simon is supporting legislation to make voting by mail possible for all Minnesotans during periods of peacetime emergency due to infectious disease outbreaks.
This is not a new way to vote; already 130,000 Minnesota residents participate in mail-in voting because they live in places with fewer than 400 voters. Unlike absentee voting, the ballots don’t need to be requested if voters are registered. Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah already conduct elections entirely by mail, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests moving toward mail voting in jurisdictions where it is allowed. Voters aren’t the only people at risk. Like in many states, numerous election judges in Minnesota are retired residents who fall into the high-risk category when it comes to severity of illness if the virus is contracted.
Despite some politicians using voting as a partisan football, mail-in ballots are a fair, smart way to safely handle November’s presidential election. A new study by Stanford political scientists — reaffirming and expanding on years of prior research — concludes no party gains an advantage when a state switches to universal vote-by-mail.
Just because we all want the pandemic to be over doesn’t mean it will be. All indicators point to this being a marathon and not a sprint. Many experts are saying cases could crest again in the fall."
"April 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/emergency-food-aid-to-help-minnesotans-struggling-with-hunger-during-pandemic/569889092/,StarTribune,Emergency food aid to help Minnesotans struggling with hunger during pandemic,"Minnesota families struggling to put food on the table during the coronavirus pandemic will get emergency relief under an expansion of the federal food stamp program.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) announced that 250,000 Minnesotans who rely on monthly food stamp benefits to feed themselves and their families will receive expanded payments under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. The amount of relief will vary by household, with benefits increasing by an average of about $150 a month per recipient.
The emergency relief will total about $55 million, and comes as state officials and hunger relief organizations struggle to prevent a hunger crisis. Demand at many of the 350 food shelves in Minnesota is double or triple normal levels, just as many food shelves are struggling with a shortage of volunteers. Public health experts have warned that rising levels of hunger and malnutrition can increase the risks of infection.
Second Harvest Heartland, the state’s largest food bank, which helps people apply for benefits through its SNAP outreach program, said March was its biggest month on record for food stamp referrals, with applications at double their normal levels. To help those too frail or sick to visit a food shelf, the nonprofit has distributed nearly 40,000 emergency food kits, with eight meals each, since the first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Minnesota in early March.
“Emergency SNAP supplements will make a real difference to families who need help now,” Human Services Commissioner Jodi Harpstead said in a statement. “Ensuring that Minnesotans with low incomes have the resources they need to put food on the table is critically important during this pandemic.”
Families who qualify for the expanded SNAP benefits will begin receiving them on April 28, and they will continue throughout May on a staggered basis. The funds will be added automatically to the electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards used to purchase food at stores. People who qualify do not have to take any action, DHS officials said.
Under the program, a family of four that receives $497 per month would get an emergency supplement of $149, bringing them to the maximum monthly benefit of $646 for the family. Households that already receive the maximum amount of SNAP benefits will not receive the higher payments.
Nearly 380,000 low-income Minnesotans are enrolled in the food stamp program."
"April 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/gov-tim-walz-announces-increased-covid-19-testing/569860492/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz announces plan to expand COVID-19 testing,"Gov. Tim Walz unveiled his much-anticipated “moon shot” testing strategy on Wednesday so that Minnesota can fully track the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused 179 deaths in the state, and diagnose all cases of people with the infectious illness.
Standing with leaders of Mayo Clinic, the University of Minnesota and HealthPartners, the governor said that this $36 million agreement will result in the most aggressive COVID-19 testing program in the nation and allow for the diagnostic testing of as many as 20,000 samples per day — beyond the 5,000 per day that he had said was necessary.
“We are smothering this issue of testing with talent, I would argue, better than any place on this planet,” he said.
While it might take a couple of weeks to reach full capacity, the state already has the ability to test as many as 8,000 samples per day now that its public, private and hospital labs are coordinating efforts, said Jan Malcolm, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Health.
The department was set to issue a health action alert to all doctors in the state, lifting previous testing restrictions and telling them to at least collect the nasal or throat swab samples for testing from patients with suspicious symptoms.
“We’re standing behind the health care systems to assure if they collect those samples, they’ll get processed,” said Malcolm, adding that the department is telling all doctors to “ ‘test every symptomatic person.’ That is your job as the health care system. Our job is to build this system to make it happen.”
The testing news came on a somber day for Minnesota, which set single-day records with 19 deaths and 154 newly lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19. The toll has been particularly harsh for long-term care facility residents, who make up 129 of the state’s 179 deaths. The total positive COVID-19 case count of 2,721 so far is based on 49,344 tests by the state public health lab and private labs such as Mayo.
State officials also continued to assess the damage of an outbreak in Nobles County that has caused 126 confirmed infections and one death, and resulted in the temporary shutdown of the JBS pork plant in Worthington. Interviews have found most of the people infected in that county are plant workers or their relatives.
Increased testing will no doubt find many more cases, given that only an estimated 5% of the state has been infected by the coronavirus so far, said Michael Osterholm, director of the U’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.
“It’s very important they understand we are in the very first innings of this game,” he said. “This is not going to get over with anytime soon … This virus will not rest until at least 60 to 70% of our population has either been infected, and then hopefully developed immunity, or we have a vaccine.”
Minnesota tried an open-ended testing approach in early March after the first cases were detected in the state, and President Donald Trump issued assurances that anyone in the U.S. who needed a test could receive one. Supplies at the state public health lab quickly ran out, though, of everything from chemical reagents needed for the test, to cotton swabs to collect nasal or throat samples for patients, to the liquid used to transport the samples to labs.
As a result, priority for the limited testing has been given to health care providers, patients already in the hospital and people living in long-term care facilities.
“You can get the care today, but you can’t get the tests today, and that’s what’s going to change,” said Andrea Walsh, president and CEO of HealthPartners.
Walz said he would hold himself personally accountable for any future backlogs in testing for people who need it. He also planned for additional testing data to be publicized on the state’s COVID-19 web page.
Minnesota’s ability to ramp up capacity is based largely on research and know-how at Mayo’s large national reference laboratory, which has already conducted 120,000 molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19 nationwide, and at the U.
Research at the U with the COVID-19 virus allowed for the development of an original testing platform that won’t be as affected by the shortages of supplies for commercial testing kits, said Dr. Jakub Tolar, dean of the U School of Medicine and vice president of clinical affairs.
“The anxiety that comes with not knowing whether you are positive or not is as contagious as the virus itself,” Tolar said, “and it’s one of the phenomenal gestures in this that we can alleviate that anxiety with science.”
Mayo and the U also have developed capacity for thousands of daily antibody tests from blood serum to determine who has already recovered from COVID-19 infections.
Increased testing is the centerpiece of Walz’s plan to trace close contacts of infected people and to quarantine them before they suffer the illness and potentially spread the virus to others. The governor said this is a necessary first step toward reopening more businesses and other public spaces. Schools and many businesses are closed under an executive stay-at-home order, which Walz has extended to at least May 4.
The stay-at-home order was put in place largely to buy time for hospitals to add beds, staff and equipment to handle an expected surge of COVID-19 cases. The state’s hospitals as of Wednesday were collectively treating 240 patients, with 117 in intensive care.
Funding for the testing expansion will come from an emergency COVID-19 response package already approved by the Legislature. The Health Department will be hiring additional staff, Malcolm said, with the expectation of many more contact investigations after more positive cases are found.
As part of the agreement, the state will also create a central lab to accommodate the expanded testing and a virtual command center to monitor testing needs and coordinate responses to potential outbreaks in the state.
The partnership was applauded by state legislators, including Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, who has been the most openly critical of the governor’s stay-at-home order.
“We have to know who is sick and who is recovered in order to safely reopen the state, and testing is one of the best ways to make sure we’re staying safe,” he said. “Testing is important not just to the physical health of our citizens, it’s vitally important to the health of the economy.”
Beyond identification of individual infections, Walz said increased testing efforts will hopefully help the state to head off future business disruptions.
“They will identify emerging hot spots of infection for rapid intervention before they become critical and, we’ve seen this happen, where we have to shut down critical industries,” Walz said."
"April 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/how-joe-biden-should-pick-his-running-mate/569891402/,StarTribune,How Joe Biden should pick his running mate,"Joe Biden intends to name a woman as his running mate. Selecting that woman, however, is a much harder decision, almost certainly the most consequential he will make this year, revealing much about his values and his judgment.
We are already hearing the chatter: Should he choose a woman who can help him get elected because she represents a key swing state, a key ethnic group or an important region? Or should he select a woman who is steeped not only in politics but also in public policy with a proven record in public service who can significantly bolster Biden’s ability to govern?
I believe Biden should focus heavily on governance, because it stems from his own experience as senator and vice president, and because rarely has a running mate had more than a marginal effect on the election outcome. And he must remember that he could well be selecting a future president. Some nominees, alas, apparently didn’t remember, giving us Dan Quayle in 1988 and Sarah Palin in 2008, whom many saw as unqualified.
Biden should assume for these purposes that he will be elected and will immediately face the formidable fallout of the continuing coronavirus pandemic — the 1918 pandemic lasted until mid-1919 — and an unrecognizable economy with probable double-digit unemployment. Both crises will require new thinking, strong leadership, empathy and compassion.
He must also devote immediate attention to lessons learned, so that the issue of public health is elevated to the top of the nation’s agenda. Accomplishing all of this will be a monumental task, and he will need the best talent available to help him, especially in his vice president, who must have the intellect, experience and confidence to advise and, when necessary, to disagree forcefully with him, because too few others will when the stakes are high and the atmosphere tense.
I was privileged 44 years ago to be present at the creation of the modern vice presidency, an almost total transformation of the nation’s second most important office, which for nearly 200 years was derided for its irrelevance. As Walter Mondale’s chief of staff in the Senate and then in the White House, I witnessed firsthand how he and Jimmy Carter reshaped a constitutional afterthought into a huge asset for the president. They decided Mondale would be an across-the-board adviser and troubleshooter for the president, focused heavily on furthering his agenda. To make this work, he would need unprecedented access to both the president and the White House paper flow, including classified national security information. Mondale proposed all this and more to President-elect Carter when we met with him at Blair House in December 1976. At Carter’s request, Mondale sent a memo incorporating the conversation to the president-elect, who quickly approved it.
President Carter went further, offering Vice President Mondale an office in the West Wing, close to his own. He admonished everyone to respond to a request from the vice president as if it came from the president. He added that anyone found undercutting the vice president wouldn’t be around for long. He made me a member of his own senior staff to help facilitate the integration of staffs. No one doubted that Carter was totally committed to this new arrangement, which was the primary reason for its success, yet he still has not received the credit he deserves for this important and lasting innovation.
Subsequent presidents and vice presidents took note, and most adopted, with appropriate variations, the Mondale model. In a sense it has become institutionalized through use; extralegal adaptation has effectively moved the vice president from the legislative branch of government, where he or she presides over the Senate, to the executive branch, where he or she can make a much greater contribution as a unique adviser to the president and become better prepared to assume the presidency if necessary.
After leaving the White House, I offered to explain the modern vice presidency to new occupants of the office of both parties or their top aides. Most heard me out respectfully, with particular interest in the weekly lunches in the president’s private office where Mondale was encouraged to raise in confidence anything on his mind.
Vice President Dick Cheney invited me to have lunch with him and his aide Lewis Libby to learn about the Mondale experience. Libby asked most of the questions, Cheney almost none; he was so oddly incurious that I wondered why I was there. It later became apparent that he had his own understanding of the office, using it to establish his own national-security power center in the White House. He proved to be an outlier among modern vice presidents, whose unspoken mantra is “There’s only one agenda, and it’s the president’s.”
Viewing President Barack Obama’s leadership style up close for eight years had much to do in shaping Biden’s ability to actually be president if necessary. No one knows more about the office of vice president than Joe Biden. When he was elected, he had extensive conversations with his friend Walter Mondale. Biden and Obama worked out their own relationship based on the by-then established principles of the modern vice presidency, adapted to reflect Obama’s needs and Biden’s strengths. It’s unlikely President Obama had been much impressed with Biden’s brief foray into the 2008 presidential contest, but he was probably very impressed with his performance in the Senate during the two years they overlapped, especially on the Foreign Relations Committee. Blending Biden’s legislative skills and knowledge of foreign policy with Obama’s deficit in both areas was a wise move. Obama had the self-awareness to know what he didn’t know and the wisdom to seek it in someone he wanted close by.
Biden has said he wants a vice president with whom he is “simpatico,” presumably meaning someone with whom he is both personally and politically compatible and who can be trusted to help him both campaign and govern. This intangible element is by far the most important factor in the equation, and it should be decisive. The best politics for Joe Biden will be the selection of a woman who will be, and be seen as, qualified to be president of the United States."
"April 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/will-small-businesses-suffer-tax-headache-from-relief-programs/569900832/,StarTribune,Will businesses suffer Minnesota tax headache from relief programs?,"Small-business owners may have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in unexpected taxes next year if they receive relief from the federal Paycheck Protection Program, according to Republican leaders in the Minnesota House of Representatives.
House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt and other Republicans are calling on state lawmakers to act next week on the issue, but Democrats don't see the urgency and some business executives are skeptical about the possible impact to their bottom lines.
The debate centers on the most attractive feature of the emergency loan program: the federal government will forgive any loans for companies that rehire all of their furloughed employees by June 30 and meet other obligations under the program. Congress specifically exempted the relief from federal taxes, but under Minnesota's tax code, a forgiven debt is treated as taxable income.
""Minnesota businesses are fighting just to survive right now,"" said Daudt, R-Crown. ""These loans are a lifeline meant to cover the basics — payroll for employees, rent and utilities. There's no reason forgiven loans should trigger a tax hike at a time when businesses can least afford it.""
Under the program, companies with 500 or fewer employees can get up to $10 million to help them survive the downturn caused by the coronavirus.
So far, 46,383 Minnesota companies have obtained $9 billion in forgivable loans through the program, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration, which oversees the program. If all of that money were subjected to a corporate tax rate of 7%, the average in Minnesota, those companies would have to pay more than $600 million in taxes, according to House Republicans. Those numbers are likely to climb higher now that Congress has added another $310 billion to the program.
However, business owners said that math overlooks an obvious accounting issue. To qualify for forgiveness, companies must spend the funds on payroll, utilities or real estate costs — all of which are legitimate business expenses that can be written off on a company's taxes.
""It might be a nonevent,"" said Mactech CEO Joel Wittenbraker, who obtained more than $500,000 through the PPP for his Red Wing manufacturing company. ""If you give me $100, and I spend that $100 on my employees, I should be able to deduct it.""
Still, Wittenbraker said, he would like to have the issue clarified.
""We've had a lot of conversations about PPP with our accountants and other people, and I never heard a peep about this,"" Wittenbraker said. ""Anytime you don't know what the rules are, you are concerned.""
Jay Abdo, senior partner of the Edina accounting firm Abdo, Eick & Meyers, said he thinks the tax consequences for most firms would be minimal.
""This is a federal program that entices you to spend the money to keep your people employed and pay your rent, and if you do that, it's a wash,"" Abdo said.
Daudt said he has spoken to Gov. Tim Walz, and he said Walz agreed that businesses should not be required to pay taxes on any relief they obtained through the PPP.
""The governor understands the difficulty small businesses are facing and wants to make sure they are able to weather the current crisis,"" said Teddy Tschann, the governor's press secretary. ""He's reviewing options on the best way to do this and is looking forward to working with the Legislature in the coming weeks on this issue.""
Daudt said he is concerned that some small businesses will reserve a portion of their funds for future taxes instead of spending the money on things that will help the economy. He noted that the Legislature previously took action to make sure people who received forgiveness on a portion of their home mortgages did not pay taxes. That measure cost the state about $7 million, according to the House Republican Caucus.
Rep. Paul Marquart, chairman of the House Taxes Committee, said he thinks the Legislature should address the PPP issue at the same time it deals with other tax issues related to coronavirus relief.
""Do we want to help small businesses as much as we can? Yes,"" said Marquart, D-Dilworth. "" But I think we need to make sure we have a full picture before we act."""

Tim Walz calls Minnesota State Fair a 'tough lift' this year given the crowds,"Gov. Tim Walz called holding the Minnesota State Fair during the coronavirus pandemic a “tough lift,” heightening concerns that the end-of-summer tradition will be canceled for only the sixth time in history.
“I wouldn’t make a definitive call, but I also don’t want to give any false hope on this. I think it will be difficult to see a State Fair operating,” Walz said in response to a question at his daily briefing Thursday.
The governor, who acknowledges he loves the fair, added that one of the greatest parts of the Great Minnesota Get-Together is being “elbow to elbow” in the crowds.
“I don’t know how you social distance in there,” he said.
Earlier Thursday, Fair General Manager Jerry Hammer said in an interview that for now the annual event is on track to open Aug. 27 and run through Labor Day as scheduled.
“We have a duty to present the fair and will continue to do so until it’s absolutely clear we can’t,” Hammer said.
A decision to cancel the fair won’t be made until it must be, he said. But he added the call would be made well before Aug. 1, though he couldn’t say whether a decision would come in May, June or July.
Hammer was firm, however, in saying that there will either be a full-on State Fair or none at all. No one is going to be scanning temperatures along with tickets at the gates, he said.
“We’re a big celebration,” Hammer said. “If the health of the people is where you need to take these extraordinary precautions, then maybe you shouldn’t be doing the event.”
No state fairs with the size and reputation of Minnesota’s have yet canceled for this summer.
The Wisconsin State Fair, scheduled to open Aug. 6 in suburban Milwaukee, is still on despite an alternative care facility built at the fairgrounds for patient overflow.
The Iowa State Fair is scheduled to open Aug. 13 in Des Moines, though officials say they “may implement some changes related to COVID-19 protocols.”
State fairs in Illinois and New York are still on for mid-August starting dates.
And preparations continue for the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, the biggest in the country, in late September and early October, though organizers say they will add to the preventive measures already planned.
Sandy Craighead, who chairs the State Fair Foundation, was aware of Hammer’s optimism but expressed some skepticism.
“Any large gatherings, I just don’t see that for a while,” she said.
Stephanie Shimp, co-owner of the Blue Barn in the fairground’s West End, said she ponders the fate of the State Fair several times a day. She needs to place orders for cups on May 1, then order the paper boats and branded liners for thousands of meals.
Eventually, she will have to order the food itself, including 10,000 pounds of chicken for the eatery’s Nashville Hot Chicken on a Stick. She has a photographer coming Friday to shoot the Barn’s new menu item for the 2020 Fair.
“We have to keep going until we’re told otherwise,” she said.
Shimp said the real drop-dead time for her comes in mid-July, when she must hire staff for the event.
With Blue Plate Restaurant’s spots closed, Shimp’s revenue is already limited. She has a sizable mortgage payment to make on the Blue Barn.
“Financially speaking, I want there to be a fair,” she said, but added she’s also worried about health and safety.
“That part of me says, ‘Geez, I don’t know,’ ” she said.
Sweet Martha’s Cookie Jar, which sells thousands of buckets of chocolate chip cookies, issued a written statement saying they’re “cautiously moving forward with planning.”
The fair has been canceled three times for wars, once because it conflicted with the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, and most recently in 1946 during a polio epidemic.
Walz acknowledged it’s tough for Minnesotans to hear the fair is in peril but shrugged and said, “We’ll hope.”
Though the State Fair was created by statute to be run by representatives from the state’s 87 counties in the Minnesota Agricultural Society, it doesn’t receive state money.
Hammer said a decision will be made when the balance tips in one direction. Until then, he said, “We’re not going to do anything that we can’t unwind. Most importantly, we’re not going to do anything that would jeopardize anyone’s health or public safety.”"

"April 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/quarantine-of-truth-taints-china-s-governance-model/569935442/,StarTribune,Rash Report: Quarantine of truth taints China's governance model,"Amid an intensifying effort to show its governance structure as superior to the West’s, China is touting its strict coronavirus quarantine as a model response to the pandemic.
But a different kind of quarantine — of the truth — belies Beijing’s geopolitical push, even if Washington’s haphazard, if not hapless, response keeps it from reasserting democratic governance as the most effective model.
China’s lies began early with the silencing of witnesses to Wuhan’s initial cases of COVID-19. What Beijing tried to cauterize as an internal matter quickly became an international one, sickening citizens worldwide while triggering a global recession that threatens to turn into a depression that could kill many more through starvation.
The opacity endures. Beijing is blocking an independent, international investigation into the outbreak’s origin, and in March expelled 13 Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and New York Times reporters in response to the U.S. limiting the number of U.S.-based reporters working at Chinese state-run media outlets whose product is widely considered propaganda.
Word of the initial outbreak “didn’t get out in time and it cost lives,” said Dokhi Fassihian, the U.S. executive director of Reporters Without Borders, which released its annual World Press Freedom Index on Tuesday.
Out of 180 nations, China placed 177th, just three spots ahead of North Korea.
“By relying on the extensive use of new technology, President Xi Jinping has succeeded in imposing a social model in China based on control of news and information and online surveillance of its citizens,” the report stated. “At the same time, he has been trying to export this oppressive model by promoting a ‘new world media order’ under China’s influence.”
The index reflects 2019 data. The 2020 pandemic is “exacerbating existing problems,” said Fassihian, whose colleague Christophe Deloire, Reporters Without Borders’ secretary-general, wrote in the report: “The public health crisis provides authoritarian governments with an opportunity to implement the notorious ‘shock doctrine’ — to take advantage of the fact that politics are on hold, the public is stunned and protests are out of the question, in order to impose measures that would be impossible in normal times.”
And in fact, amid the COVID-19 chaos, 15 prominent pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers in Hong Kong were arrested last Saturday, and China continues its territorial ambitions in the South China Sea, where the U.S. upped the stakes by sailing two ships into contested waters off Malaysia. And according to a New York Times report, U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Chinese operatives have amped up COVID-19 disinformation campaigns spread virally, and virulently, on social media.
Beijing’s offensive does not mean China wasn’t forced to initially play defense. Some even thought that the lethal malfeasance would be a “Chernobyl moment” that laid bare the barren conscience and competence of the Communist Party.
But because China was in lockdown, an already suppressed press and people did not demonstrate, and in fact a nationalist backlash against internal dissent, let alone the West, was whipped-up within the country.
But internationally it doesn’t appear that this is “the great moment where China surges forward because they handled the virus very effectively in four to six weeks as America flailed and stumbled,” said Evan Medeiros, the chair of Asian Studies at Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service.
Medeiros, along with his Georgetown colleague Michael Green, are co-authors of an influential Foreign Affairs article “The Pandemic Won’t Make China the World’s Leader: Few Countries are Buying the Model or the Message from Beijing.” In an interview Medeiros said that “the global pandemic has created an opportunity where the Chinese are trying to promote their governance choices, their value system, as superior to a Western democratic system. The fact that they were able to get control over the virus pretty quickly, flatten the curve, they’re saying proves the strength of their system.
“So in many ways they’re creating an almost values-based competition with the United States. And as America fails to manage this while at the same time not embracing the values at home or abroad that America has traditionally stood for is like making a fight with one hand tied behind our back.”
America needs all hands on deck to fight COVID-19, let alone covert Chinese social media campaigns and other forms of propaganda it’s propagating about the pandemic and its paradigm of governance. But what’s needed in response isn’t a reinvention, but a rediscovery of our model’s embedded advantages.
“The current geopolitical situation is tailor-made for American leadership,” said Medeiros. However, he continued, “when America looks like it’s struggling it just creates opportunities for China to step forward.”
As China has stepped forward internationally it’s leapt into America’s consciousness and campaign. Two-thirds of Americans now have an unfavorable opinion of China, a sharp spike of 20 percentage points since the start of the Trump administration and the highest since the Pew Research Center began to ask the question in 2005. Accordingly, Sino-American relations and the pandemic are endemic in this year’s election, with President Donald Trump — who has repeatedly replaced references to coronavirus with “Chinese virus” — and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden already trading jabs on China ties. China, Medeiros said, “is going to be as heated an issue in our election as at any time since Tiananmen.”
But beyond politics, governance — of the country and the COVID-19 crisis — is where America could geopolitically counter China.
“An essential component of combating this disease and hopefully eradicating it at some point is American governance,” Medeiros said. “We have all these incumbent strengths that should position America to be able to come out of this better and stronger both at home and also geopolitically.”
Among the necessary elements to do that, Medeiros noted, is that “The government needs to hear from a free and open media, the government needs to be open to criticism from the press. … One of the saddest things I’ve seen from the Trump administration is how they’ve sought to marginalize media that is critical to them and empower media that just applaud them, which is shades of the kind of political system operated in China.” (The U.S. ranked a disappointing, if not dismal, 45th on the World Press Freedom Index, well behind four top-ranked Scandinavian nations.)
“American values,” Medeiros stressed, still endure. “What America represents, First Amendment freedoms, has always been one of America’s greatest strengths geopolitically.”
It’s always the right time to protect and project those values. But amid a great internal and international challenge, they’re needed more than ever."
"April 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/pandemic-targets-america-s-racial-gaps/569934422/,StarTribune,Pandemic targets America's racial 'gaps',"In hot spots around America, it’s become clear that African-Americans are disproportionately contracting and dying from the deadly coronavirus. For every 100,000 black Americans, about 23 have died from COVID-19, a mortality rate more than double that of whites and other groups, according to the independent APM research group.
And in six states and Washington, D.C., black mortality rates are even higher, most dramatically in New York state where the rate has been nearly four times greater.
In Minnesota, blacks comprise about 7% of the state’s population and so far make up about 13% of confirmed cases, although only 3% of deaths. Hispanics comprise 6% of cases and 3% of fatalities, according to state figures. Health experts expect the local minority numbers to rise and more closely mirror the disparities in other states.
Health officials believe the real numbers in Minnesota’s minority communities are likely higher because the state doesn’t have race or ethnicity data for about 20% of documented cases. In addition, much of the testing up to this point has been done in areas or facilities that are mostly white.
Setting aside Minnesota’s situation, the stark national differences are disturbing but not surprising. They are yet another product of America’s well-documented economic “gaps,” which can be seen in everything from education to income to housing. In many areas, Minnesota is known to have even wider disparities than many states.
Health is also on that list. That’s why it’s critical to collect accurate demographic data and to use it to target testing and other COVID-fighting efforts to lower-income black communities.
Like those in congregate homes for the elderly and homeless shelters, blacks are more likely to have underlying health problems that are associated with the worst COVID-19 outcomes — conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma. Disproportionate levels of poverty and other barriers mean less access to nutritious food and regular health care.
Similar poverty, health and access issues threaten to put Latinos and Native Americans at greater risk for COVID-19 complications. Another contributing factor explaining higher case numbers is that large numbers of people of color work in lower-paying, customer-facing service jobs that can’t be done from home.
During last week’s COVID-19 updates, Minnesota officials acknowledged that “existing racial and economic inequities have been exacerbated” by the coronavirus and that they will work toward “long-term protection” of at-risk populations. The announcement last week that Minnesota is working toward testing 20,000 people per day will help.
“This expanded testing capacity will be transformative to our COVID-19 response, especially for vulnerable populations: individuals living in congregate care settings or experiencing homelessness; communities of color and American Indians; and critical workers,” Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said.
Like Hurricane Katrina, the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare America’s deep differences in illness and death by race, ethnicity and income. And the devastating statistics should fuel a national resolve to finally address these unacceptable inequities."
"April 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesotans-eager-to-vote-as-always-but-not-in-the-old-way/569933892/,StarTribune,Minnesotans eager to vote as always — but not in the old way,"How serious are Minnesotans about voting this year? Here’s my personal gauge: As the pandemic’s pain deepened last week, several friends asked me for advice about how to order a mail-in absentee ballot for the state’s August and November elections.
And it’s only April.
I took that smattering of queries as a reassuring sign. What I deem a defining Minnesota trait — devotion to participatory democracy — appears to be holding fast in the COVID-19 storm. But it also has me buying Secretary of State Steve Simon’s prediction that at least half of this year’s ballots are likely to be cast by mail.
State lawmakers ought to take such early interest in absentee voting as a call to action. As much as ever — maybe more than ever — Minnesotans are keen to vote this year. They deserve to do with a safe and orderly process befitting the state with the highest voter turnout in nine of the last 11 presidential elections.
An ability to vote safely and in good order this year will be much enhanced if the Legislature puts an emergency election assistance bill on its must-do list for this COVID-hijacked session. Take it from a leading local elections official.
“We could really use a bill,” said Deborah Erickson. As administrative services director for Crow Wing County, Erickson oversees elections in 64 precincts, some in fast-growing Brainerd, some in sparsely populated townships where vote-by-mail has long been the rule. She’s also been chair of the elections committee for the Minnesota Association of County Officers for 10 years.
She speaks for many when she pleads with legislators for two kinds of relief — money and rule flexibility.
Federal money is there for the tapping, provided legislators grant their permission. Minnesota is one of the few states that requires legislative approval before federal money can be spent. This state’s share of the two most recent congressional appropriations for election administration comes to $14.3 million, with possibly more to come.
It’s a situation that gives legislators ample opportunity to tie the release of those funds to their favorite notions about election law — and that means ample opportunity for stubborn partisanship to seize up the works. Last session, $6.6 million was bottled up in the Republican-controlled state Senate for months before finally being released, long after other states had started spending their shares of the 2018 federal Help America Vote Act to shore up cybersecurity.
Erickson explained that this year’s untapped federal money — and likely more — will be needed to cope with an increase in absentee and early balloting that swells from 24% in 2018 to more than 50% in this, a higher-turnout presidential election year. Think more temporary staffing; more vote-counting equipment (and/or moving the equipment already on hand); more office space to process absentee ballots in a socially distant way; more postage costs; more public-information expenses.
In-person voting in a pandemic will also cost more, Erickson said. Election judges will need safety equipment, cleaning supplies, even disposable pens. More election judges per precinct will be needed to keep voters safely distant from one another — even as many of the elders who dominate the ranks of the state’s election judges decline to serve this year.
That points to the need for flexibility that Erickson also seeks from the Legislature. She envisions setting up larger-facility “vote centers” that serve a number of precincts and in some places might start serving voters well before Election Day, to accommodate a surge of in-person early voting in a safer setting than a courthouse typically affords.
Under current law, polling places must be chosen by Dec. 31 for the following year’s election. Changing that date to July 1 would put local officials on firmer legal footing. (Cities have emergency powers that might be invoked to do the same, Minneapolis election officials told me last week. But legal clarity is desirable in an activity that’s highly prone to pesky litigation.)
Another plea to legislators: Allow more processing time for absentee ballots. They now can be unsealed and counted no earlier than seven days before an election and no later than 24 hours after the polls close. More time at both ends is in order, given the crush that’s likely coming.
Provisions like these are part of a bill that won approval by a DFL-controlled state House finance committee on Thursday. But it advanced on a party-line 11-7 vote, and no similar bill has yet surfaced in the GOP-controlled Senate.
Those are a worrisome signs of gridlock, ones that Minnesotans who expect to vote via absentee ballot this year ought to notice. Apparently — and unfortunately — the propensity to play politics with election administration that was on full display last year has not been suppressed by the novel coronavirus. It may take a howl from Minnesotans who were appalled by what they saw in Wisconsin’s April 7 primary to jar legislators out of their pre-pandemic pattern.
Voting has particular appeal during a pandemic, my ballot-seeking friends left me thinking. They complained about the uncomfortable feeling that the virus has taken charge of their lives. Their desire to vote had the quality of a sick person seeking an antidote. They are keen to assert control — to say to COVID-19, “You’re not in charge of our government. We the people are.”
Legislators ought to be attuned to that sentiment, and should want to reward it."

Nonprofit organizations, accounting for nearly one in 10 jobs in the U.S. private workforce, with more than 12 million total employees, are in crisis.
For many nonprofits, especially those that provide safety-net services, demand has never been higher, and it’s only expected to grow in the coming months. At the same time, spring fundraising events have been canceled, and many donors are concerned about their own finances and capacity to give. And, in this election year, political campaign spending has already diverted funds from nonprofits, with more to come.
Many people with the ability to give are asking, “How do we best respond to this crisis?” Here is my advice:
Give locally. Unlike natural disasters, which are usually place-based, this pandemic is everyplace-based. The best place to start is in our own communities and states where we are most familiar with the needs, nonprofits and people.
Give more to the nonprofits you already know. Ask: How are they responding to COVID-19? How are they serving the community during this crisis and what do they most need? Consider making an additional donation to ensure that your favorite nonprofits will be here when the virus subsides.
Support newly created funds responding to the pandemic. Many states and cities, most community foundations, and other organizations have established funds specifically designed to provide aid in this crisis. These organizations are collecting funds and deploying them where the needs are greatest.
Trust nonprofits to choose how to spend the funds. Now is not the time to direct how your donations should be spent. Trust your nonprofit partners to direct donated money where they believe it can have the most impact. Also, relax any usual grant reporting requirements during the crisis so that nonprofits’ stretched resources can go to where they’re needed right now.
Dig deep. Take stock of what you have and need, and, if you are able to, stretch to give more to others who are more severely hurt by this pandemic. Focus less on what you have lost and more on what you have. “When you let go of trying to get more of what you don’t really need, it opens up oceans of energy to make a difference with what you have,” said author Lynne Twist.
If you are involved with a private foundation, remember that the 5% payout requirement is the floor for donations, not the ceiling. “The strength of a funder’s grantees at the end of this crisis will be a much better measure of the significance of a foundation than the size of its endowment,” according to many philanthropy leaders.
Also consider the expanded use of program-related investments in addition to grants.
Anticipate mid- and long-term needs. Although the needs are acute today, they will continue to grow long after the immediate health crisis subsides. The mid- and long-term effects of unemployment, homelessness, hunger, physical and mental health needs and more will continue to grow for many months after the coronavirus has spiked. If you can, create a plan for future giving, as well.
View this as an opportunity for growth, change and reflection. “We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now,” said Martin Luther King Jr. Many people are writing about how life will be different after COVID-19 and the collective, societal effects of this disaster. Now is a great opportunity for each of us and our families to reflect on how we consume, share, collaborate, invest and give to our near and far neighbors.
“We are witnessing an extraordinary moment in the contemporary history of humankind and the life of the planet,” said Richard Woo, senior adviser in philanthropy, impact investing & social equity. “Both natural ecosystems and those systems created by people are threatened and faltering. The world is changed already by the pandemic and more is to come. Therein lies an opening. In philanthropy, we have an opportunity, a choice and an obligation to do more than simply witness, but rather to act now to support a bottom-up movement to reinvent systems to be more just, sustainable and whole.”
May each of you stay safe and healthy. If you are able to do so, please deepen and augment your philanthropy to help address the effects of COVID-19 in this time of great need."

Entering the year, only 15% of 3M’s N95s were made for health care customers. Not even four months later, it’s now 90%. That “flip” was done at the same time 3M raced to quadruple production rates, said Denise Rutherford, 3M’s senior vice president for corporate affairs.
The dash to ramp up production involved opening idled production lines and finding factory workers to get them going. It meant overcoming regulatory and trade barriers, changing supply chains on the fly and reconfiguring its distribution.
It wasn’t all smooth — from the operational or public relations standpoints. 3M had to navigate a political firestorm when President Donald Trump decided it was not working fast enough to achieve U.S. needs.
Yet industry watchers are lauding 3M as handling it particularly well, even as it was dealing with cratering demand for other stalwart lines such as automotive and industrial products as the economy slowed to unprecedented levels amid the fight to stop COVID-19’s spread.
Coming off a tough year, 3M’s financials are expected to show the same effects seen by other big global companies when 3M reports first-quarter results Tuesday.
“3M is definitely not immune from what is transpiring in the economy, but there are pieces of the economy that are obviously going to see somewhat of a windfall,” Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said.
Springing to action
When 3M saw the severity of the coronavirus spread in China in January, the company accelerated its production. It had been down this road before with smaller outbreaks of SARS and H1N1. At that time, 3M bought extra manufacturing equipment for each of its factories around the world that made personal protective equipment (PPE).
For 3M “to have that surge capacity available is not typical in modern lean supply chains. And it’s incredibly expensive,” said Kyle Goldschmidt, assistant professor of operations and supply chain management at the University of St. Thomas.
N95 masks are considered the gold standard because they block 95% of airborne particulates. As coronavirus spread across Asia, Europe and the U.S., N95 demand far exceeded past pandemics and forced 3M to increase its “surge capacity” efforts.
That wouldn’t have worked, Goldschmidt said, if the company did not already have a framework in place.
“My guess is that academics will be writing case studies about 3M’s efforts and how well prepared they were in the wake of this virus,” he said.
Scramble mode
By the time the U.S. had put together a coronavirus task force led by Vice President Mike Pence, 3M had identified some obstacles where the government could help.
When Pence visited the Maplewood campus March 5, one of the asks was for a quick change in regulation that would allow the N95s made for U.S. industrial use to be sold to U.S. health care entities. Once that was done, CEO Mike Roman said earlier this month, 3M redirected its main distributors to sell to where the need was.
3M turbocharged its relationships with six medical distribution giants and started airlifting masks to COVID-19 hot spots in New York and Seattle. In other cases, 3M employees delivered the respirators themselves, for example, moving 500,000 masks from its South Dakota plant to New York City and Seattle in a single day, a 3M spokesman said.
As one team worked on distribution, another increased manufacturing. The company has pledged to double its worldwide N95 manufacturing twice since January for a total of 2 billion masks a year.
Yet by January, 3M had maxed out its N95 manufacturing in Shanghai. Weeks later, its mask factories in South Dakota and Nebraska were also running 24/7. The company added equipment in Aberdeen, S.D., to increase capacity.
By March 30, the Valley, Neb., plant was hitting a wall, said Wade Kretman, technical director for the 3M Auto Aftermarket Division, who received a call asking him to help with the situation. Kretman’s mission was to find 50 3Mers with factory experience from Minnesota and Iowa to work in the factory for several weeks.
Kretman said he had 200 volunteers “in the snap of a finger” and a team was traveling in 24 hours time.
Other workers came out of retirement to help with other needs, including Don Garvey and Bruce Penning. The two now field customer calls from their homes to help overwhelmed colleagues who run the Personal Safety Division (PSD) Helpline.
Helpline calls tripled to 1,000 a day in four weeks as anxious customers inquired about the virus, mask fittings, expiration dates and how to use two-filter industrial paint respirators some had found in dusty basements.
Garvey, a retired 3M construction health and safety manager, said he now spends nine hours a day talking to people from factory workers to government officials, with queries from how to use them to more operational questions.
The relationships, he said, have become personal in minutes and he admits while he likes to think of himself as a tough guy, he has found himself in tears.
Reaching out
Since January, 3M also reached out to find partners: “Anywhere that 3M can find someone to help us, we are not too proud,” said Rodney Hehenberger, leader of 3M Respiratory Global R&D.
That included creating relationships in weeks that can in normal circumstances take years. After idling several of its auto plants, Ford started reaching out to see how it could use its manufacturing capacity to make health care components.
The automaker sent engineers and representatives to 3M’s Nebraska plant, Ford figured out it could make its own version of battery-powered “PAPR” respirator to help shore up PPE capacities. Auto supplier Cummins is making filters for PAPR respirators.
Trump kerfuffle
By the end of June, 3M’s two U.S. plants should be making 50 million N95s a month. Until then, 3M arranged for its factory in China to export more here.
As 3M was working with trade groups, governments and supply-chain experts to figure out how to increase the imports, Trump inserted himself strongly into the situation at the beginning of the month. Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on April 2, ordering 3M to send as many respirator masks as needed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
As Roman pushed back, calling “absurd” claims that the company wasn’t doing as much as it could to help U.S. customers, 3M also was negotiating with the Trump administration. Within a week, Trump publicly said he now liked working with 3M and announced a $76 million federal contract with the company.
3M agreed to import 166.5 million masks from China by July. That would help infuse the U.S. with extra supplies until 3M’s South Dakota and Nebraska production rates were high enough.
After 3M and other companies increased production capacity many times over in China, by March when that country was recovering, there was supply available, said Serguei Netessine, vice dean of the Wharton School of Business.It still took some time, he noted, for the governments to negotiate trade allowances.
Even with agreements in place, the path to importing PPE remains turbulent.
Ben Bidwell, director of U.S. Customs for Eden Prairie-based logistics company C.H. Robinson, said the company is fielding hundreds of PPE equipment requests. Demand, he said, exceeds available airfreight capacity from Asia.
And because of quality concerns and a recent swell in counterfeit products and marketing, China implemented new safeguards that require more time. 3M also has increased efforts to find and investigate fraud in relation to N95 masks.
One more challenge
The pandemic added a crisis on top of a year spent dealing with global economic problems and in the U.S. with lawsuits over claims of PFAS chemical pollution and military earplugs malfunctions. Its stock had plummeted 30% last year, while peer companies saw a drop of 10%.
“The last 12 months have been filled with issues and challenges, there is no question,” said Edward Jones’ Arnold. “3M has underperformed its peers.”
Still, the “ramp-up in the production of masks is a win,” Arnold said. “3M will obviously benefit from demand and they can play a really critical role in combating the outbreak in the process.”"
"April 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/president-is-playing-nation-s-doctor-as-he-promotes-virus-treatments/569954752/,StarTribune,President is playing nation's doctor as he promotes virus treatments,"It was at a midday briefing last month that President Donald Trump first promoted two anti-malaria drugs in the fight against the coronavirus.
“I think it could be something really incredible,” Trump said March 19, noting that while more study was needed, the two drugs had shown “very, very encouraging results” in treating the virus.
By that evening, first-time prescriptions of the drugs — chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — poured into retail pharmacies at more than 45 times the rate of the average weekday, according to an analysis of prescription data by the New York Times. And the nearly 32,000 prescriptions came from across the spectrum — rheumatologists, cardiologists, dermatologists, psychiatrists and even podiatrists, the data show.
While medical experts have since stepped up warnings about the drugs’ possible dangerous side effects, they were still being prescribed at more than six times the normal rate during the second week of April, the analysis shows. All the while, Trump continued to extol their use. “It’s having some very good results, I’ll tell you,” he said in a White House briefing April 13.
The extraordinary change in prescribing patterns reflects, at least in part, the outsized reach of the Trump megaphone, even when his pronouncements distort scientific evidence or run counter to the recommendations of his own experts. It also offers the clearest evidence yet of the perils of a president willing to push unproven and potentially dangerous remedies to a desperate public.
On Friday, the FDA warned against using the drugs outside a hospital setting or clinical trial because they could lead to serious heart rhythm problems in some coronavirus patients. Days earlier, the federal agency led by Dr. Anthony Fauci — one of Trump’s top advisers on the pandemic — issued cautionary advice on the drugs and stated that there was no proven medication to treat the virus.
As the prescriptions surged in the second half of March, the largest volumes per capita included states hit hardest by the coronavirus, like New York and New Jersey. Georgia, Arkansas and Kentucky were other states with relatively high per-capita figures.
More than 40,000 health care professionals were first-time prescribers of the drugs in March, according to the data, which is anonymized and based on insurance claims filed for about 300 million patients in the United States, representing approximately 90% of the country’s population. The data is current through April 14.
The data was compiled by IPM.ai, a subsidiary of Swoop, a company in Cambridge, Mass., that specializes in health care data and analytics based on artificial intelligence. It does not include drugs prescribed to patients in hospitals, where some doctors have administered the medication, or those released to hospitals from the Strategic National Stockpile.
After Trump’s remarks last month, retail pharmacies across the country reported a run on the drugs, which are mostly prescribed by a small subset of medical specialists. Within days, states began issuing emergency orders to restrict the new prescriptions.
Although the availability of hydroxychloroquine has improved in recent weeks, the FDA still lists it as being in short supply.
Mike Donnelly, vice president of communications for the Lupus Foundation of America, said that the organization received calls and e-mails daily from patients told their prescription could be filled only in part or not at all. A spokesman for the Arthritis Foundation said some patients received their refills only after calling around to as many as a dozen pharmacies.
In the past month, about 40 states have intervened in some manner to quell the frenzy.
Idaho was the first to take a hard line, issuing a temporary rule on the same day that Trump first mentioned the drugs in his daily briefing. The rule banned pharmacists from dispensing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine unless the prescription included a written diagnosis of a condition that the drugs had been proved to treat. The rule also limited prescriptions to a 14-day supply unless a patient had previously taken the medication.
The director of Idaho’s State Board of Pharmacy said at the time that many of the prescriptions were being written by doctors for themselves and their family members, a trend reported by other state boards as well.
Some of those writing prescriptions for themselves may have been on the front lines treating patients; the data shows an uptick among health care practitioners working in emergency medicine. More broadly, the analysis indicates a major shift in the kinds of medical practitioners writing the prescriptions, based on patterns in retail pharmacies since 2016.
Historically, the majority of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine prescriptions have come out of a narrow band of specialties like rheumatology. That changed last month, when the specialties reflected in the data included larger numbers of those working in dermatology, ophthalmology, podiatry, urology and other areas.
The interest in taking chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment did not originate with Trump.
Reports from doctors in China and France that the drugs might help patients fueled interest in scientific and medical communities here. Conservative media, in particular, trumpeted the drugs’ potential effectiveness, and the data shows prescriptions had already increased 2½ times over the weekday average during the week before Trump’s March 19 briefing.
In a March 21 tweet, Trump extended his interest to a combination of one of those drugs, hydroxychloroquine, with an antibiotic, azithromycin.
The tweet coincided with a weekend flood of prescriptions for the two anti-malaria drugs. By the end of the day, the prescriptions had increased 114 times at retail pharmacies compared with the average weekend day, according to the Times analysis.
On Tuesday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, led by Fauci, issued guidelines against the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin except in clinical trials, with experts citing the potential for toxicities.
Enthusiasm for the drugs has been waning, including at Trump’s own news conferences and among researchers.
By Thursday, Trump had moved on to a different subject — the use of disinfectants to kill the coronavirus inside the body. Dire warnings followed from state health officials who were inundated with requests for information about such a course of action. Trump later insisted he had only been kidding."
"April 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/covid-19-fuels-big-increase-in-biking-and-walking/569963482/,StarTribune,Pandemic fuels big increase in biking and walking in Minnesota,"Twin Cities residents are not driving as much as they were before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, but they are walking and biking a lot more.
Data from the Minnesota Department of Transportation show a 51% increase in walking and bicycling in the metro area over the past five weeks — since Gov. Tim Walz issued a peacetime emergency and enacted a stay-at-home order — when compared to the same time frame over the past few years.
Statewide, those activities are up 72% since mid-March, based on information collected from MnDOT’s permanent and portable pedestrian and bicyclist counters.
“It’s great to see people out,” said Amber Dallman, MnDOT bike coordinator.
They have been out in droves on West River Parkway in south Minneapolis. The daily average of people walking and biking is 144% higher than the daily average from 2017 to 2019. That equates to 21,000 more people walking and bicycling there between March 13 and April 19, Dallman said.
With streets and paths more crowded, it’s more important than ever for drivers to slow down and be watchful for those traveling on foot and two wheels, said Sgt. Jeremy Ellison of the St. Paul Police Department.
By now, Ellison has usually held a few of the city’s Stop For Me events, but the coronavirus has delayed the start of the 2020 program. The annual campaign designed to get motorists to stop for pedestrians at crosswalks will be back soon, however, with a goal of hosting 100 outreach and crosswalk enforcement events this year, he said.
A study by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, published in the March edition of the Journal of Transport & Health, found drivers of “higher status” vehicles were the least likely to stop for pedestrians. The odds of a driver stopping fell 3% for every $1,000 increase in the car’s value, based on pricing categories from Kelley Blue Book.
The study also found that overall, motorists yielded less frequently for men and for people of color waiting at midblock crosswalks than for women and whites.
Ellison said the study provides something to think about, but really, “it’s all about human behavior.”
That’s why Stop for Me training will focus not only on motorists, but also on pedestrian behavior. The campaign will show pedestrians how to safely cross the street and point out why crossing midblock puts them in danger.
“The likelihood of getting hurt is very high,” Ellison said. “You should use a crosswalk or cross at a light.”
A stoplight for Natchez
The Scott County Transportation Department has the green light to install a traffic signal at 185th Street and Natchez Avenue.
The County Board on Tuesday approved $465,000 for the signal. The board also authorized highway engineer Tony Winiecki to order hardware and equipment so that it’s on hand when a contractor is chosen to install it.
“We want to construct this as fast as we can,” Winiecki said during the board meeting.
He said his department had looked at various options for traffic control at the intersection in Credit River Township where there have been two fatal crashes in the past 15 months and 17 wrecks since 2006.
Ultimately the department opted for a traffic signal as “being the right solution for intersection control at this particular intersection,” Winiecki said."

Tim Walz says as daily COVID deaths hit 28","Minnesota recorded its highest daily death toll from COVID-19 on Sunday just as the state is preparing to loosen some workplace restrictions to allow tens of thousands of residents to return to work.
The state recorded 28 new deaths from COVID-19 on Sunday, marking the first time that the state has averaged more than one fatality linked to the illness per hour. The state also saw its youngest confirmed victim, a person in their 40s.
“This is a heartbreaking loss for our state and my thoughts are with each grieving family,” Gov. Tim Walz tweeted Sunday. “This won’t be the last hard day, but if we continue to look out for each other and stay home we can help protect our neighbors and loved ones.”
Minnesota’s mortality milestone comes as the United States is speeding toward 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases nationwide. Just over 100,000 people in the U.S. have fully recovered from the illness, while nearly 50,000 have died.
Officials at the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended reopening shuttered state economies only after a state’s COVID-19 case count declines over 14 days.
Minnesota is moving ahead with an initial loosening of workplace restrictions on Monday, allowing as many as 100,000 in manufacturing and office work to return to their jobs, joining the 2.6 million Minnesotans who are already working. Meanwhile, residents are waiting to see whether Walz is going to extend or modify the statewide stay-at-home order that is set to expire May 4.
The 28 new deaths reported Sunday included the state’s youngest person yet to die of a confirmed case of COVID-19.
State Health Department officials said the person in their 40s had underlying health problems and lived in an assisted-living facility in Hennepin County. As of Sunday, the state’s COVID-19 mortality statistics show people between the ages of 44 and 109 have died. (Investigators are still examining the death of a 38-year-old man from Cambridge who had asthma.)
All told, 272 people have died in Minnesota after getting COVID-19. The 28 latest deaths happened between 4 p.m. Friday and 4 p.m. Saturday and were included in the state’s daily report Sunday morning.
In general, COVID-19 is thought to pose greater health risks for the elderly, especially those living in group settings. The median age of people who have died from COVID-19 in Minnesota is 83, while the median age of confirmed cases is 52. At least three-quarters of people who have died with COVID-19 in Minnesota were in group-living facilities.
COVID-19 is an illness caused by a new kind of coronavirus first identified in China late last year. The virus, which spreads through droplets of water on the breath of those infected, has been difficult to diagnose and track because of the slow pace of reliable testing. That means the confirmed daily case counts reported around the nation likely underrepresent the actual number.
Since March 6, Minnesota has confirmed 3,602 cases of COVID-19, including 156 new diagnoses on Sunday. Of those cases, 1,774 people — slightly less than half of the total — have fully recovered and no longer need to remain in isolation. Just under 59,000 COVID-19 tests have been completed in Minnesota.
Researchers are racing to find a vaccine to prevent the virus or new ways to help infected people fight it.
John Bessler, husband of U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., revealed Sunday that he participated in a federally sponsored experimental treatment program for COVID-19. Bessler, who was briefly hospitalized with the virus in March, became the seventh person who had recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma as part of the Mayo Clinic’s program.
Patients in the study receive an infusion of antibody-rich plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19.
“We are working with physicians and hospitals across the nation to determine if antibody-rich plasma donated by patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can help fight the virus in patients with active COVID-19 disease,” Dr. Michael J. Joyner, principal investigator of the Expanded Access Program for Convalescent Plasma, said in a statement.
Meat-processing plants have proved to be hot spots of infection, as have congregate-living facilities like nursing homes.
In Nobles County, widespread testing for COVID-19 has led to 352 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and one confirmed death. The sprawling JBS USA pork-processing plant in Worthington closed indefinitely last week amid a wave of COVID-19 cases among workers.
Hormel Foods said Friday that it was indefinitely closing two Jennie-O Turkey Store plants in Willmar after 14 workers tested positive for COVID-19. Kandiyohi County, where the plants are located, had 35 confirmed cases as of Sunday, a sharp increase from one week earlier when the county had two confirmed cases.
Just across the state border, the Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Sioux Falls became a hot spot with more than 700 confirmed COVID-19 cases. An investigation by BuzzFeed News documented missteps by the company, including posting early health notices only in English, and waiting until 238 workers had confirmed cases before pausing operations to clean the entire plant.
Meanwhile, group-living facilities in Minnesota have become hot spots for active cases, from Duluth to New Hope to Winona.
Minnesota has more than 100 investigators doing intensive contact-tracing work to locate and isolate those who have been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19, and the state may need to add hundreds more as testing and confirmed cases ramp up in coming weeks.
Walz has issued 45 executive orders related to COVID-19 that have dramatically reshaped the daily lives of Minnesotans, closing schools, canceling medical procedures, ordering work from home and shuttering thousands of public spaces across the state.
But while the coronavirus is highly communicable, it doesn’t appear to be contagious from more than 6 feet away. That has led to growing pressure to reopen public spaces where people or groups can remain 6 feet apart.
Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka appeared in a video on Twitter on Sunday saying he wants churches to reopen once there is a plan for that to happen safely. The East Gull Lake Republican said many pastors in Minnesota are ready to restart Sunday services, understanding that worshipers need 6 feet of social distancing and may not be able to touch anything during the service.
“If you can congregate at a big box store safely on a Sunday, you should be able to attend your place of worship,” the Minnesota Senate Republicans said in a tweet that contained Gazelka’s statement on reopening churches.
Last Thursday, Walz published an illustration of a dial that showed places of worship tend to pose greater risk of transmission than small social settings like family gatherings, but less risk than sporting venues. As the state “turns the dial” to lessen social restrictions over time, the least-risky social settings will be the first to reopen, while the most unpredictable settings will take the longest.
Although at least 80% of people who get the virus have only mild symptoms, as many as 5% may go on to require critical care in a hospital, including intubation for a mechanical ventilator. Those statistics are rough averages that are difficult to refine without better estimates of the actual number of people who have gotten COVID-19.
As of Sunday, there were 170 people in regular hospital beds with COVID-19 and another 115 receiving intensive care in hospitals."

Instead, they should ""tighten up, make some cuts and manage,"" Haley said in a tweet last week.
The tweet reflects the latest GOP talking point in a growing debate over state shortfalls during the coronavirus crisis. Also last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected calls from Democrats to give those struggling states, many of them blue, tens of billions of dollars in emergency pandemic relief legislation. Said McConnell: ""There's not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations.""
That's rich, coming from the senator of a state, Kentucky, that takes $148 billion more out of the federal pot than it takes in, as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo noted.
That's especially rich for Haley, who as South Carolina's governor had no hesitation about federal aid when her state's rainy day came in the form of flooding after storms in 2015. Not to mention that like Kentucky, South Carolina under Haley collected more federal money than most states.
It's far from unusual for public officials, both Democratic and Republican, to have short memories regarding previous positions and actions (see gerrymandering, minority party, everywhere). But it's hypocritical for leaders like McConnell to tell cash-short states to buck up while bailing out industries that are experiencing a similar COVID-19 cratering — or helping out other cash-strapped pensions.
As for Haley, who knows exactly what it's like when the state you govern faces a crisis out of your control? It's galling. It's baldly political. And in the midst of a crisis like no other, it's distasteful."
"April 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-republicans-seek-sign-off-on-federal-covid-19-funds/569988152/,StarTribune,Minnesota Republicans seek sign-off on federal COVID-19 funds,"Uneasy with Gov. Tim Walz's executive actions closing much of the state during the COVID-19 pandemic, Minnesota Republicans are pushing for legislative approval of any federal funds that flow into the state in response to the coronavirus.
Facing a May 18 deadline to finish work during the regular legislative session, Republicans and some Democratic senators advanced a bill Monday that would require the House and Senate to sign off on spending some $2 billion in federal aid to respond to the virus.
The bill passed Monday in the GOP-controlled Senate, 42-25, with six Democrats joining all Republicans in favor. However the push faces slim prospects in the DFL-controlled House, whose leaders are largely allied with the governor on his spending priorities and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even without final approval by the Legislature, the debate over federal spending in the state is likely to carry into the fall elections, accentuating growing partisan differences over the timing and extent of Walz's stay-at-home orders.
The coronavirus money, part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, has been approved by Congress to help patch funding for cities, schools, hospitals, transportation systems, food production and other critical needs. Of Minnesota's share of federal funding, $317 million was automatically transferred to the state's two largest counties, Hennepin and Ramsey. The funding can also be used to reimburse $520 million in state funds already spent in response to the virus.
But some legislators want a say in how the rest of the money is doled out, even after they adjourn in May.
""The Legislature was created and elected to listen and react to the concerns of the public,"" said Sen. Julie Rosen, R-Vernon Center, the author of the bill. ""All these people that have been affected by COVID-19, they need a place to talk and voice their opinion.""
Minnesota's Legislature is part time, but federal funding flows into the state year-round. When that happens after lawmakers adjourn, a group of six members known as the Legislative Advisory Commission can review and give their OK to federal grants.
Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Myron Frans said the Legislative Advisory Commission already gives lawmakers a chance to review federal spending that requires flexibility in emergency situations such as COVID-19. ""The current process does not prevent the Legislature from appropriating these federal dollars, and we support them in directing resources to meet community needs,"" he said. ""However, by establishing a new state process, [this bill] presents a solution to a problem that does not exist under current law.""
Rosen said the size of the federal response to COVID-19 goes far beyond what the commission is used to handling. Her bill is modeled after a long-ago bill lawmakers passed to provide oversight over hundreds of millions in federal funds sent to the state during the Great Recession.
But Democrats criticized the bill as an unnecessary layer of oversight when the federal government has already set conditions on how the money can be used.
Rosen's bill also would require lawmakers to come back into a special session every time they need to approve federal funding, a logistical challenge once they adjourn and return to their districts around the state. Only the governor can call them back into a special legislative session.
""I believe if we leave here May 18, and there's an emergency and money needs to be allocated right away, that it will take days or weeks — if not longer — to come together to an agreement before we come to a special session,"" said Sen. Melisa Franzen, DFL-Edina. ""Every time we've had a special session, it's not hours, it's not days, it's weeks and months before we come back here and it's an orchestrated event.""
While there is no companion proposal in the DFL-led House, Republicans in the minority also have expressed concerns about what will happen after legislators go home for the year.
Since the pandemic hit Minnesota in March, Walz has twice declared a peacetime state of emergency, giving him broad authority to respond using executive action. He's closed down public schools, bars, restaurants and most other public spaces to respond to the virus, which has already infected thousands in the state and killed nearly 300.
Sen. Mary Kiffmeyer, R-Big Lake, said the state constitution gives the Legislature, not the governor, the power to appropriate money.
""We've now had emergency powers that have exceeded any emergency powers that I can remember in history,"" she said. ""To put all of that responsibility in one person, clearly, our Minnesota Constitution saw the separation of powers.""
For some legislators, the bill feels like a repeat of the debate over federal election security funding through the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which took all session for lawmakers to approve last year. Minnesota was the last state to approve the use of the election funding.
""I think if anything that argument has worked against my friends across the aisle,"" said Sen. Jason Isaacson, DFL-Shoreview. ""All I have to do is look to the way they handled the HAVA funding to know that I wouldn't want them anywhere near this federal funding to make sure it goes someplace relevant and helpful."""

 COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, much like influenza, and while there’s not a vaccine for it, there are ways to cope. The precautions used to fight influenza are the same ones that people should be using to stave off coronavirus and other respiratory diseases, said Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health.
- Wash your hands regularly
- Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze
- Stay home from work or school when you’re sick
- Drink lots of fluids
The CDC recommends washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose or sneezing. It also advises to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth and to frequently clean objects and surfaces you touch often.
READ: Tough coronavirus prevention advice: Don't touch your face  
Should I be wearing a mask on my face?
Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control encourages people, especially in areas hit hard by the spread of the coronavirus, to use coverings such as homemade masks, bandannas or T-shirts for their faces while outdoors.
Simple cloth masks that cover the mouth and nose can prevent virus transmission from individuals when they are out buying groceries or seeking medical care.
The guidance, a change from the CDC's previous recommendation, came as states continue to cope with critical shortfalls of N95 masks and other personal protective equipment and raised concern that it could cause a sudden run on masks.
Trump and other administration officials sought to minimize any burden by stressing the recommendations did not amount to requirements and that a variety of homemade coverings were acceptable.
However, some individual cities, businesses and health organizations are requiring homemade masks or face coverings for people to enter. 
Federal officials said that surgical masks and N95 respirator masks should be reserved for those on the front lines of fighting the spread of the infection. N95 masks must be fitted and tested to work properly. The same goes for exam gloves, which can get contaminated just like our hands. There’s no need for them if you’re washing your hands properly and often.

PODCAST: What you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic now.
Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19?
Washing your hands with soap and water is the most effective way to protect yourself, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “But if soap and water are not available, using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can help you avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others,” the agency says on its website. Sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs and they are less effective if your hands are visibly dirty or greasy.
“It is very important when you use hand sanitizer that you use an adequate amount and you cover all of the surfaces of your hands,” said Dr. Alison Peterson, vice president of medical affairs at Allina Health’s United Hospital in St. Paul. Also, let your hands dry before touching anything. Apart from cleaning your hands, remember not to touch your face, something that is often easier said than done.
What is ""flattening the curve"" and how does social distancing help?
“Flattening the curve” is an expression used to explain how slowing the exponential growth in a disease’s spread can allow a country’s health system to better cope with the surge in cases so that it isn’t overwhelmed.
While the novel coronavirus pandemic might eventually infect a majority of people in the United States, the speed at which the outbreak spreads makes a huge difference in health outcomes. What epidemiologists fear is that the U.S. health system would become overwhelmed by a sudden surge that requires more people to be hospitalized than can be handled, both from a personnel and equipment standpoint. In a scenario of uncontrolled growth, more people would die simply because there might not be enough doctors, nurses, hospital beds or ventilators for people who need them.
“If you look at the curves of outbreaks, they go big peaks, and then come down. What we need to do is flatten that down,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
Flattening the curve means that the social distancing measures being deployed in places like Italy and South Korea and now in the United States aren’t so much about preventing illness but rather slowing down the rate at which people get sick, according to Vox.
Without any measures to slow it down, COVID-19 will spread exponentially for months. An interactive simulation by the Washington Post shows how the spread can be slowed by use of “social distancing,” avoiding public spaces and large group gatherings that can increase the rapid spread of COVID-19."
"April 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/lawmakers-eye-building-projects-to-boost-minnesota-s-economy-in-pandemic/570017862/,StarTribune,Lawmakers weigh building projects to boost Minnesota's economy in pandemic,"Minnesota’s political leaders agree that public construction projects could create jobs as the economy lags, but they head into the final weeks of the legislative session split on how much long-term debt the state should take on for that work.
The COVID-19 pandemic has given new dimension to the usual debate at the State Capitol over the scale of a public infrastructure bill. Gov. Tim Walz and legislators in both parties say they are determined to pass a borrowing package that will quickly create jobs.
“It makes absolute sense to view it as a stimulus act that will have a positive impact on businesses, positive impact on revenue, and of course changing the layout of deteriorating infrastructure,” Walz said in a recent call with the League of Minnesota Cities.
With just three weeks remaining to finish the work of this year’s session, House DFL Capital Investment Committee Chairwoman Mary Murphy said lawmakers are working daily on the borrowing measure, called the bonding bill. But the scope of the projects the bill might include remains unclear.
Legislators are selecting from hundreds of requests from state agencies, local governments, colleges and universities.
The bonding bill is typically the biggest spending measure the Legislature passes in even-numbered years. It often comes together behind closed doors in the final hours of the session. With the coronavirus forcing legislators to do most of their work remotely, the process is even less transparent.
Walz provided the starting point for the discussion in January. He proposed a nearly $2.6 billion capital investment package ranging from local roads to college buildings. Despite the budget challenges of the pandemic, he is still pushing for that amount.
House Speaker Melissa Hortman said Monday the bonding bill should be more than $2 billion, or “as big as is responsible.” Republican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka has repeatedly suggested the state could bond for $755 million without taking on additional debt payment costs. But he said this week he is willing to borrow more than that, though he did not give a number.
Gazelka said deal making is tied up with two other pieces of legislation moving at the Capitol: a tax bill, and the push by Senate Republicans to gain more oversight on how federal funds to the state are used to fight coronavirus.
Both the House and Senate leaders say the final shape of the bonding bill will be influenced by an updated budget forecast which Minnesota Management and Budget is expected to release next week. Hortman expects bonding talks to be “expedited” after that.
Plans for a bonding bill have been scaled back since this winter, said Sen. David Senjem, GOP chairman of the Senate Capital Investment Committee. He expects the state will face a budget deficit and said Minnesota needs a measured approach to taking on additional debt.
“As we’re seeing the gloom and doom of how this is affecting everybody … we need to be a little more guarded. I just don’t think that we’re going to be setting any records this year,” Senjem said. Lawmakers could probably agree to a bonding bill around $1 billion, he said, but “$2 or $3 billion, those numbers are kind of off-the-charts right now.”
While legislators said they are hard at work on a bonding deal, the efforts are not easily apparent to the public or even lobbyists, who are used to grabbing legislators around the Capitol to push their projects. Neither the House nor Senate Capital Investment Committees have met publicly in the past month and a half. The Senate committee on Wednesday will hold its first hearing since the coronavirus hit. The panel is scheduled to talk about rebuilding the state’s economy through transportation infrastructure investments.
League of Minnesota Cities lobbyist Anne Finn said city officials are constantly calling their organization to see what they can do to keep local projects in the mix at the Capitol, but the League hasn’t been privy to negotiations.
“Since the pandemic started, there’s a much bigger sense of urgency around getting a robust bonding bill in 2020,” she said. “We think that this will help stabilize the economy.”
Walz made a similar argument last week. He said the coronavirus is likely to prompt an economic crisis approaching the magnitude of the Great Depression.
“With that being the case, there’s going to be an argument about austerity, meaning just cut everything down. … That’s the worst thing you could do,” he said.
Cash-strapped businesses are not going to be able to jump-start the economy. That responsibility will fall on the federal government, because it is allowed to run a deficit, and states can use bonding to pay for projects, Walz said.
More than ever, the borrowing bill should focus on projects that don’t need additional planning and can put people to work quickly, Senjem said. “We would like to see shovels turning dirt, and hammers pounding nails ... concrete being poured,” he said."
"April 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/3m-posts-strong-q1-results-but-warns-of-more-cost-cutting/570006322/,StarTribune,"3M posts strong Q1 results, but warns of more cost-cutting","3M beat financial expectations for the first quarter, but officials said the win did not come easily and more cuts are needed.
Rising demand for personal safety, health and consumer goods during the coronavirus pandemic drove 3M's strong first-quarter results.
Yet a torrent of activity to shore up cash reserves, cut costs and manage supply chains and weak industrial sales helped 3M beat expectations even with adjusted earnings falling 2.7%.
On average, Wall Street analysts had expected the adjusted earnings to drop 9% and flat revenue. 3M's revenue for the quarter grew 2.7% to $8.1 billion.
Net income for the quarter ended March 31 rose 45% to $1.29 billion, or $2.22 a share. Excluding one-time events, earnings were $2.16 a share.
""It was kind of remarkable that they were able to keep revenue growth,"" said Kevin Earley, investment manager with Mairs & Power.
""They are doing the things we like to see 3M do. They already had some cost [reduction] programs in place and now they have got another round of cost containment efforts going on …[for] the second quarter,"" he said. ""That speaks to the management and how they can react to the slowing environment.""
3M said savings from actions such as furloughing workers in units affected most by the economic downturn, and additional actions it will take, will net $350 million to $400 million in savings during the second quarter.
3M also suspended its share repurchase plan, reduced its full-year capital expenditures from at least $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion, and boosted cash reserves by tapping $1.75 billion in debt programs.
As public companies across sectors have done, 3M withdrew its 2020 guidance because officials said they could not predict the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Going forward, CEO Mike Roman told analysts he would provide them with monthly revenue updates so investors could still keep track of sales progress.
For now, Roman said he is beginning to see ""broad-based"" recovery in China — especially in electrical and semiconductor products — but noted he is also still seeing soft global demand of auto, aerospace and products tied to oral care and elective surgeries.
The winner for the first quarter proved to be sales of disposable N95 respirators and products tied to food safety and biopharma filtration products, Roman said. Before the COVID-19 crisis, 3M's global sales of all disposable respirators contributed $600 million to annual revenue. Today those sales are higher, but the company did not disclose by how much.
Total health care sales grew 21% during the quarter, and consumer goods (which included masks sold in hardware stores) grew 4.6%. During the quarter, 3M's larger Safety & Industrial unit's sales fell 1%, and its Transportation and Electronics unit saw sales fall 5%.
3M's January through March results were welcome after a punishing end to 2019 when fourth-quarter earnings plunged 27% prompting 1,500 job cuts and $348 million in litigation and restructuring charges.
3M's stock price rose 2.6% Tuesday to close at $157.61. It is down from the 52-week high of $192.19 per share and far off the $250 a share high enjoyed in 2018.
Investors have been largely pleased with how 3M has handled the demands of COVID-19, said Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold. However, the problems that plagued the company going into 2020 — mainly possible liabilities from lawsuits involving PFAS chemicals — have affected the stock.
But with COVID-19 and 3M's strong ramp-up of N95 respiratory mask production, Arnold said the company will ""benefit and that should at least serve as a partial offset to other businesses, which are likely to be very hard hit whether it is because of the shutdowns of production or their customers being shut in.""
3M is on track to quadruple global production of N95 masks to 2.2 billion a year, including 50 million a month in the U.S., Roman said. The company is importing 166.5 million masks by the end of June from its factory in Shanghai.
3M's efforts won praise from Wall Street analysts who called 3M's COVID-19 work ""aggressive"" and ""responsive.""
Colin Scarola, CFRA research analyst, raised his 3M stock recommendation from ""hold"" to ""buy"" after noting that 3M beat Wall Street expectations with help from its health care and medical supply products.
""We expect industrial end markets to be weak throughout 2020"" due to COVID-19 business shutdowns that started in March, Scarola said. Still, cost cuts should benefit profits while continuing medical sales should ""limit 2020's revenue decline to 6%, much better than the downturn the broader economy will face, in our view."""
"April 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-takes-on-the-meat-plant-quandary/570022492/,StarTribune,Trump takes on the meat plant quandary,"The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads most easily when its potential human hosts spend lengths of time in close quarters. That’s exactly the environment in which employees at meatpacking plants labor. The unsurprising result has been COVID-19 hot spots in such facilities and subsequent plant closures. Hardest hit is pork, with a 25% reduction in capacity this week.
The closures ripple both ways in the food supply chain. Consumers are expected to see smaller selections and higher prices. Farmers, who operate on finely tuned husbandry schedules, face decisions of whether to euthanize animals for which no market is readily available.
To President Donald Trump, the situation is ripe for an exercise of the Defense Production Act, which allows him to mobilize private industry in the national interest. Trump has been meek about using that authority during the coronavirus crisis, even amid shortages of critical medical supplies, except for the occasional grandiloquent gesture. But on Tuesday, officials said he would cite it to order meat-processing plants to stay open.
Good? Bad? Or just another impossible choice amid the pandemic?
One in three of the nation’s largest meatpacking plants operates in a county with a high rate of COVID-19 infection, according to USA Today. For the convenience of the American consumer, who on average eats roughly twice the amount of protein recommended daily, the administration will put these workers at risk. Politico reported that the government will provide additional protective gear for employees as well as guidance.
Still, according to the Wall Street Journal, White House officials fear that as much as 80% of the industry’s capacity could be shut down without action.
Trump told reporters that “there’s plenty of supply” but that there’s a “legal roadblock.” He meant that the owners of processing plants face liability risks and need protection. The Labor Department is expected to issue guidance.
It seems likely that any liability questions will end up in court. Much rides on the administration’s guidance. It will be interesting to see if it’s clearer than that of the Small Business Administration regarding the Paycheck Protection Program, a much-needed relief effort that’s been hampered by clumsy execution."
"April 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/when-is-covid-19-most-contagious-when-are-you-no-longer-considered-contagious/570038591/,StarTribune,When is COVID-19 most contagious? When are you no longer considered contagious?,"When is COVID-19 most contagious? When are you no longer considered contagious?
People sickened by COVID-19 are most infectious when they are showing symptoms, including fever, coughing and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But new research confirms that those without symptoms are playing a significant role in spreading the virus. A study of cruise ship passengers found that nearly 18 percent of them tested positive and had no symptoms. State of Minnesota and University of Minnesota researchers modeling the pandemic’s effects now estimate that one infected person is spreading it to as many as four others. That’s up from two to three transmissions per infected person, reflecting the greater role of asymptomatic transmission, according to Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm.
That’s why public health officials recently changed guidelines on masks to suggest that people who are out in public should wear a homemade mask to lower the chances that they will make someone else sick.
The virus is still thought to be primarily transmitted by breathing in the respiratory droplets released by an infected individual.
“Person-to-person transmission occurs when an individual with the infection emits droplets containing virus particles while coughing, sneezing, and talking,” according to a recent article published on the Journal of the American Medical Association website.
The virus can also exist on surfaces. “Survival of the virus on innate surfaces has been an important topic of discussion. While there are few data, the available evidence suggests that the virus can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces at room temperature for up to 9 days,” the JAMA article said. That’s why it is important to wash your hands and try to avoid touching your face.
After a person recovers, it is unclear how long they remain contagious. Genetic material of the virus may be detectable up to two weeks after infection, but that “does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present,” according to the CDC.
Is there an average length for COVID-19 illness to run its course?
It really depends on how bad the symptoms are and whether any serious complications develop. “About 80% are mildly to moderately symptomatic,” said Dr. Timothy Sielaff, chief medical officer at Allina Health. “That can mean fever, cough, muscle aches and lethargy, which last a few days and improve over several more; typically 2 weeks or so.”
These mild cases can recover at home because there is no treatment for COVID-19.
When complications develop, such as pneumonia, hospital care may be needed so doctors can monitor symptoms and provide support to stabilize the situation and hopefully keep things from getting worse.
“Severe illness can last longer especially if hospitalization or intensive care is needed; on the order of 3-6 weeks,” said Sielaff.
What is the criteria is to be listed as ""recovered?"" Do they assume if your fever and cough is gone you're recovered?
The Minnesota Health Department so far has kept in contact with all people who have tested positive. Each case differs, so recovery depends on the guidance provided by a doctor or a public health official. But generally, people are considered recovered when the symptoms go away.
“If you are sick, we are asking people to stay home for at least seven days and you need to be fever free for at least three days without the aid of fever reducing medications,” said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director at the Health Department.
The World Health Organization considers two negative COVID-19 tests taken 24 hours apart to be part of its official definition of recover, but a shortage of tests makes that difficult.
“It will be useful to the individual and the community to have negative testing to confirm, but we do not have enough tests available right now,” said Dr. Timothy Sielaff, chief medical officer at Allina Health. "
"April 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-patients-anxiously-waiting-for-surgery-delayed-by-covid-19/570042062/,StarTribune,Minnesota patients anxiously waiting for surgery delayed by COVID-19,"Cancer surgeries to remove certain tumors have been delayed, as doctors try other treatments.
Operations to treat semi-clogged heart arteries or remove a gallbladder have been put on hold when possible, as hospitals try to conserve protective equipment for treating a surge of COVID-19 patients.
Children needing complex orthopedic procedures wait as the risks of delay are balanced against the chance of being exposed to the coronavirus while recovering in a hospital.
Delays of nonessential surgeries in Minnesota have caused anxious waits for patients needing treatments that sound a lot more serious than the word ""elective"" might imply. The good news, doctors say, is a delay in the surge of COVID patients combined with an increase in testing capabilities is creating a chance to get more procedures done in the near term.
Getting through the backlog won't be easy, though, since thousands of surgeries have been postponed already.
""We have a group of surgeons who are reviewing this on basically a daily basis, and it is really hard work,"" said Dr. Tim Sielaff, chief medical officer at Allina Health, which operates 11 hospitals. ""There's a really significant gray area between 'clearly it has to be done,' and 'clearly it doesn't have to be done.' ""
In mid-March, when Minnesota had confirmed just a few dozen infections of the novel coronavirus, hospitals across the state started postponing surgeries to conserve resources to treat COVID-19 patients. Gov. Tim Walz issued an order that postponed ""all nonessential and elective surgeries and procedures"" beginning March 23 and stipulated that delays should not create ""undue risk to the current or future health of a patient.""
The phrase ""elective procedure"" might conjure visions of cosmetic surgeries and low-key treatments, but that's a far cry from the surgeries that Claire Lindell needs to address a curvature of her spine.
The 4-year-old from Prior Lake was scheduled to undergo surgery March 30 at Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare in St. Paul to begin correcting the spinal deformity. After the operation, she was to stay in the hospital for up to six weeks followed by a second surgery.
In mid-March, the Lindell family was getting in the car to drive to a final doctor's appointment when they learned the surgery was being delayed indefinitely.
""There are a lot of plans that were laid out over the course of a five- [to] six-month period and just — poof! — they all went away,"" the girl's father, A.J. Lindell, said.
Claire was born with a genetic condition that affects her lungs and heart, and scoliosis contributes to respiratory troubles by compressing one of her lungs. Impaired lung function puts patients at risk for COVID-19.
When surgery was still on the schedule, A.J. Lindell said he was apprehensive about his daughter spending so much time with COVID-19 patients being treated nearby. With the delay, Lindell now wonders if Claire will have to repeat some of the pre-surgery work — she went through more than a dozen appointments and tests before the postponed operation.
""You have the uncertainty of her condition in the meantime,"" added Lindell, who says he understands why the surgery had to be put on hold. ""We're hoping that we see a little bit of a light at the end of the tunnel here, and maybe the hospital will figure out a way to partly open.""
Delaying surgery for 30 to 60 days might be reasonable in Claire's case, but things get more risky as more time passes, said Dr. Tenner Guillaume, an orthopedic surgeon who is chief of staff at Gillette Children's. With children, delays in treatment can have lifelong impacts.
Delaying procedures to prepare for COVID-19 has been the right decision, Guillaume said, but it's created a growing dilemma for the health care system. So far, Gillette Children's has postponed more than 10,000 appointments.
""Right now, as physicians, we're trying to work out: What does a return to normal mean?"" Guillaume said. ""With the backlog of cases now, we're going to have to develop new systems to try to figure out how do we get this all done for everyone, and how do you begin to prioritize one case over another.""
When Tara Hershberger was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in early March, doctors at the Mayo Clinic scheduled her surgery for March 30. Five days before the operation, the clinic called to say the procedure had to be postponed.
Hershberger, 39, of Fountain, says she trusted her doctors, but also felt anxious because she wanted the cancer out. Rather than operate, doctors prescribed medicine that can slow or stop the growth of a tumor by blocking hormones.
About two weeks later, she learned Mayo Clinic doctors could operate after all and the surgery was a success.
""But during those 14 days, none of it made sense — none of it,"" she said. ""I thought it was all wrong.""
Mayo Clinic officials did not comment on Hershberger's case. But the clinic, like cancer centers across the country, has been postponing cases where possible, said Dr. Robert McWilliams, a medical oncologist. In many cases, doctors are flipping the sequence of care, McWilliams said, by providing chemotherapy, hormone therapy or immunotherapy before going to surgery.
""Nothing in medicine we do has zero risk,"" McWilliams said. ""We did everything we could to minimize that risk.""
Mayo decided it had to delay procedures following episodes in March in which doctors operated on patients who later tested positive for the coronavirus, McWilliams said. The exposure resulted in entire surgical teams being sidelined, since there's a higher risk for the virus to spread when inserting a breathing tube into a surgical patient.
In addition, with an expected surge in COVID-19 patients, Mayo had to create hospital capacity.
The pause helped Mayo determine how to air out operating rooms between cases, McWilliams said, to reduce risk of airborne exposure. The clinic also devised a process for coronavirus testing — surgical patients now take the test two days before an operation, McWilliams said, and are essentially isolated until the surgery happens.
""Patients who are COVID-positive and go through a surgical procedure, they are at higher risk for complications,"" McWilliams said. ""So, it's not just about protecting the medical teams.""
Increased testing supply is helping the clinic work through the backlog of delayed procedures, McWilliams said, with priority for those that must get done first.
At Allina, about 4,000 surgeries have been delayed within the last month.
Many hip and knee replacements have been put on hold, although doctors don't want to minimize pain with the underlying condition, said Sielaff, the chief medical officer. ""If you're waiting to have a hip replaced, your life is not happy,"" Walz said last week during a call with reporters.
There's no holdup with emergency trauma surgeries or operations for symptomatic cancers, Sielaff said, but some uncomplicated gallbladder removals and cardiovascular procedures have been postponed.
""There is a potential risk associated with a delay in their necessary surgical care,"" Sielaff said. ""What we have been trying to do is balance the risk of exposure, or the risk of having an operation and harboring COVID, vs. the benefits of the operation.""
Doctors are now ""cautiously optimistic,"" Sielaff said, that they can perform more surgeries due in part to the recent push for Minnesotans to stay home to prevent the virus from spreading. It seems the expected surge of COVID-19 patients has been delayed as a result, he said, adding that doctors can care for more patients within the limits set by Walz.
There's a similar move across the country with the American Hospital Association and two prominent physician groups issuing this month a ""road map for readiness"" on when and how to resume more elective procedures.
""When we start talking about COVID not being over with for a year or 18 months … we need to start getting those patients in and getting their treatments done,"" said Dr. Mary Dale Peterson, president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists."
"April 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/walz-to-unveil-what-s-next-for-minnesota-after-stay-at-home-order/570054902/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz to unveil what's next for Minnesota after stay-at-home order,"Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday will announce the next phase of Minnesota’s COVID-19 response — likely dialing back some business closures and restrictions under the current stay-at-home order, which ends Monday, but leaving others in place amid an accelerating death toll.
Speaking Wednesday in Worthington, where an outbreak among workers shut down the JBS pork plant, the governor said a wholesale ending of the order would be futile because many workers would refuse to return to workplaces with high infection risks. However, large and small employers alike should be able to reopen when they put effective social distancing precautions in place.
“If we can make a large plant function, and we can do it without infecting people, we probably ought to be able to allow the Ace Hardware store to be able sell a hammer when they need to with a couple people in the store,” he said.
“The surest way we get this economy back going again,” he added, “is we make sure people feel safe and secure.”
Walz said the stay-at-home order has bought hospitals time to prepare for a surge of COVID-19 cases by reducing face-to-face contact and disease transmission by 80%. The governor said he is now confident that patients with severe cases will have intensive care beds and ventilators available to them, even at the peak of the pandemic. But he stressed that the peak is very much ahead.
“This thing is like gravity,” he said, “It will run its course. It will eventually climb a peak and go over it. The only question is, how steep the peak is and how quickly it comes.”
Minnesota deaths from COVID-19 have now reached 319, with the addition of 18 deaths reported Wednesday — including a 30-year-old with underlying health problems who is the state’s youngest victim so far. The state also has 4,644 lab-confirmed cases based on 66,744 tests — including single-day highs reported on Wednesday of 463 cases and 2,915 tests.
Walz and his administration have received numerous suggestions on what to do next, including from Republican lawmakers who have criticized the stay-at-home order for putting more than 567,000 people temporarily out of work.
Senate Republicans received 2,000 responses in an online suggestion box — with a Chaska salon owner offering to wear disposable gloves and masks with each client, and a Hutchinson dog groomer offering to care for dogs that are leashed outside his store.
“I think it’s really important to open what we can, and then try to sort things out,” said Sen. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka. “I wish I could stop worrying about it, but I feel like the kid standing outside their house waiting for the fire department to come and there’s no sirens.”
New research using the University of Minnesota’s national hospital bed tracker offered a cautionary tale of moving too quickly, though. Minnesota saw a 355% increase in hospital bed usage from March 28 to April 8, when stay-at-home restrictions started to pay off, but then much slower growth in bed usage after that. In Iowa, where statewide orders fell short of doctor recommendations, the growth in bed usage remained steady.
“We still are on an exponential growth curve,” said Dr. Archelle Georgiou, an executive in residence at the U’s Medical Industry Leadership Institute, and a leader of the research. “And so it would suggest that there may be value in extending the stay-at-home order or certainly being quite cautious in opening up.”
While the research can’t prove cause-and-effect, Georgiou said the findings show the Minnesota policy “seems to have had an impact … where we changed the trajectory of where we expected our state to be.”
Walz has repeatedly said that football stadiums and crowded bars will be among the last to reopen. His strategy has been to start with businesses with predictable patterns of foot traffic and face-to-face interactions, which can use social distancing to further reduce the risk to workers.
Walz said that the state “rolled 100,000 workers back into the workplace” this week in manufacturing and warehousing sites that met this criteria and had plans in place to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. While an estimated 20,000 businesses could have reopened this week, a spokesman for the state Department of Employment and Economic Development said there has been no official count of how many actually did so, or how many workers returned.
Target and the Minnesota Safety Council teamed up on a health tracking app that businesses could use to assess workers and identify early signs of COVID-19 outbreaks. Target also is offering infrared thermometers at wholesale prices so that Minnesota businesses can check workers before their shifts start.
Other apps to track hot spots of COVID-19 outbreaks have emerged, including a HealthPartners SafeDistance app that uses public COVID-19 case data but also crowdsourcing information from mobile device users to estimate risks in communities.
The state’s success in the next phase of its pandemic response will depend on Minnesotans sticking with social distancing — even as businesses reopen — and on accurate tracking of the outbreak to detect any hot spots, said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner.
“That’s a really important part of the whole equation,” she said, “the ability to use the results of the increased testing to inform our control strategies.”
While the number of diagnostic tests has exceeded 2,000 in each of the last seven days, Minnesota might not reach Walz’s goal of 5,000 per day by Monday. The governor had wanted that level of testing as part of a strategy to ease back his stay-at-home order.
Testing is not “ramping up quite as quickly as I had hoped,” Malcolm said, due to delays in setting up a coordinated statewide strategy and getting supplies to the right locations. The state is still on track to reach a capacity of up to 20,000 tests per day under a $36 million partnership with the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic, she added.
State Sen. Karin Housley, R-St. Marys Point, had suggested the next step for the state should be universal COVID-19 testing in long-term care facilities that have been hardest hit by COVID-19. As of Wednesday, 249 of the state’s 319 COVID-19 deaths involved long-term care residents.
“We need to know the most vulnerable residences so there can be an appropriate response to mitigate tragedy before it strikes,” Housley said.
While testing has been prioritized for long-term care facilities, Malcolm said supplies aren’t built up enough yet to entertain this idea. Universal testing also could be problematic for timing purposes, as a worker could test negative one day and be infected the next.
While supplies of protective masks and gowns remain a concern, state officials said they are pleased with the rapid preparations by hospitals. State emergency management director Joe Kelly said the hospitals have doubled the capacity of intensive care beds and squeezed an extra 1,800 regular hospital beds into their facilities.
That expansion comes on top of plans to use other facilities for overflow of routine, non-COVID-19 patients. The state on Wednesday signed a lease to use a shuttered Roseville nursing home as one such site.
“We hope we don’t ever need to use them,” Kelly said.
The ultimate question is whether social distancing also reduced the impact of COVID-19 and lessened whatever peak of cases is in Minnesota’s future. Malcolm said a new modeling analysis by U and state health researchers should offer new predictions next week."

It's a widely acknowledged fact among doctors and public health officials, including those at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, who require the makers of all COVID-19 tests to print disclaimers to patients saying they could have the illness even if the test comes back negative.
""There may be substantial transmission before onset and even by someone who never reports symptoms,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
But widespread misunderstanding about the meaning of COVID-19 test results still exists, underscored publicly this week by statements from White House Coronavirus Task Force chairman — Vice President Mike Pence. He said Tuesday he could tour Mayo Clinic without a protective mask because he and his entourage are tested ""regularly"" for COVID-19.
""I don't have the coronavirus,"" Pence said Tuesday, though no test yet presented to the FDA can confer that level of complete assurance. By Thursday, Pence was wearing a protective mask when he toured a retrofitted GM plant in Kokomo, Ind.
The gold-standard diagnostic tool used in laboratories today to detect evidence of COVID-19 is molecular RT-PCR testing.
But even molecular testing is not definitive. While positive results from a PCR test are seen as ""very likely"" being accurate, disclosures say, there's a greater risk of getting a false-negative result.
PCR tests require a lot of things to go right — correct reagents are needed, specimens and chemicals need to be stored correctly, samples need to be properly drawn.
The virus can also be missed in a person who has had it for only a few days. The ""limits of detection"" and analytical specificity and sensitivity for molecular tests vary widely.
""False-negative results are consequential,"" researchers at the Mayo Clinic wrote earlier this month. ""Individuals with these results may relax physical distancing and other personal measures designed to reduce the transmission of the virus to others."""

The bill, approved on a 40-27 vote, would postpone the due date for roughly $1 billion in state taxes, expand a number of tax credits and cut rates for charitable gambling. Republican Sen. Roger Chamberlain of Lino Lakes, the sponsor of the legislation, said lawmakers are “directly, aggressively trying to support employers and employees across the state” with the changes.
The measure faces opposition in the DFL-controlled House, where Democrats are pushing their own relief package that would add state funding for housing assistance and rural broadband and for low-income families. Democrats have criticized the $330 million price tag of the GOP tax proposal, given the expected revenue losses from the pandemic.
Sen. Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, warned of a “mammoth problem” ahead. “Unless the federal government comes in with a boatload of money, I don’t know how we are going to get out of this hole that we’ve got here,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, acknowledged the uncertain fiscal future. But he called the tax package a “smart bill and slimmed-down bill,” noting Republicans already shelved a proposal for a full rollback of state Social Security taxes, a key element of the caucus’ 2020 agenda.
“This is something we can use right now to help our small-business owners,” he said. “Even buying them another 60 days in not having to pay those taxes could be the difference in them making it or not making it.”
Lawmakers started the year with a projected $1.3 billion surplus. The crisis is expected to wipe out that budget reserve. Minnesota budget officials are expected to provide an update on the state’s finances in early May."
"April 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/how-congress-can-vote-remotely/570081132/,StarTribune,How Congress can vote remotely,"The coronavirus pandemic has caused unprecedented change to every facet of our lives. Millions of Americans are working remotely, performing the essential functions of their jobs away from their workplaces, often at home. But right now members of Congress can’t perform some of the key functions of their job because they are back in their home states and districts, unable to cast votes, debate or hold remote hearings.
That is not acceptable, in our view. Congress must continue to function during national crises, even if we cannot meet in person for weeks or months at a time.
An essential part of the Senate’s constitutional function, no matter the circumstances, is for senators to cast votes on legislation. We propose allowing remote voting during emergencies on a temporary basis. In times like these, that means updating Senate tradition so senators can follow the guidance of medical experts and adhere to strict social distancing measures. We are at the point where remote voting may be critical for the Senate to be able to govern on behalf of the American people and help lead our country through this crisis.
While there are logistical challenges involved, the technology exists for the Senate to adopt a secure remote voting system. Our specific proposal would authorize the Senate’s technology leadership — the Senate sergeant-at-arms — to determine the specifics of a remote voting system. There are three security principles that any such system should follow.
First, senators must authenticate their identity before casting a remote vote. There are a number of practices that are already available, such as biometrics or supplementing passwords with a one-time generated code, perhaps the most common form of two-factor authentication.
Second, while a senator’s identity must be authenticated before the vote, a senator’s vote must be verified after the vote, to prove that their decision was actually theirs. Since votes are public, one option is to pair senators so that they can check in with their colleagues and make sure their vote is correct. By allowing a layover period after all the senators have voted, we can be sure to give them time to “check their work” and ensure the correct outcome. Another option is to conduct votes over secure video conference so that votes can be verified by each senator’s face and voice.
Finally, everything must be encrypted. Millions of Americans already use end-to-end encryption apps to protect their text messages and calls. The Senate should consider evaluating off-the-shelf solutions to protect the integrity of remote votes.
We understand that some have concerns about making such a fundamental change to the way the Senate operates — it is an institution built on tradition, and we agree that those traditions should be respected. But this is an extraordinary time. Today, we face a pandemic. Tomorrow, there could be a new national crisis, preventing members from convening safely.
We believe the security solutions necessary to carry out remote voting are already available. The legislative branch should have the ability to perform its most critical functions remotely during emergencies. The people’s voice should be heard through Congress, no matter the crisis."
"May 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/a-global-crisis-lurks-in-health-and-hunger/570128572/,StarTribune,A global crisis lurks in health and hunger,"The coronavirus pandemic has created a disruption domino effect of a health crisis — a collapsing economy, rising unemployment and disruptions to the food supply are all upending the developed world.
The developing world is experiencing the same emergency. But as with so much in this era of intensifying inequality, the suffering is on an order of magnitude much more extreme — and lethal. In fact, COVID-19 could create a “hunger pandemic,” according to David Beasley, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, who in an address to the U.N. Security Council and in media appearances has described the dire possibility of a staggering 260 million people “marching to starvation.”
The U.N. amplified the theme when it said for the first time since 1998, global poverty rates will rise and that by the end of 2020, 8% of the world, or about half a billion people, will be destitute due to the pandemic’s impact.
Many already have been hit hard by the global lockdowns necessary to save lives, especially because in so much of developing world work is in the informal economy, and governments don’t have adequate safety-net resources.
Compounding factors include a global demand contraction; increasing calls from countries like Russia and Vietnam for export bans on some staples like wheat and rice; an oil-price shock shredding several Mideast, African and Latin American economies; reduced remittances from emigrants essential to developing nations; armed conflict; climate-change displacement; and in some African and Asian nations, an almost biblical plague of locusts.
On top of these is COVID-19 itself, which has already ravaged countries such as Ecuador. Reliable data is difficult in countries with unreliable leaders, but Brazil and Venezuela, among other nations, have been hit hard, too. Most countries in the developing world don’t have the kind of societies or space to successfully social distance. They also lack anywhere near the number of ventilators, ICU beds and personal protective equipment that have been hard to get even in the West.
Regarding world hunger, “COVID-19 no doubt will worsen the situation significantly,” Rob Vos, director of the Markets, Trade and Institutions division of the International Food Policy Research Institute, told an editorial writer in an e-mail exchange. Specifically, Vos added, the three key factors driving spiraling hunger and poverty are the global recession that’s also hurting developing countries’ export earnings, disruptions in the food-supply chain and limited capacity of countries to counteract the economic damage.
But amid the grim reality, he said there is hope, including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank setting up new mechanisms for large-scale financial support to developing countries. But much more is needed, and soon.
“Overall, so far it seems too little and, if major economies do not get their act together, it may soon prove to be too late,” Vos said.
While the world has had this many hungry people before, the speed and pace of the pandemic-triggered collapse is “unprecedented in recent history,” Vos said. “So unprecedented action will be required to avoid not only many people [who] will die from COVID-19 but possibly many more from hunger.”
This means homing in on both health and hunger mitigation; it is not a binary choice.
“It’s not COVID vs. hunger,” Beasley told “PBS NewsHour.” “We have got to work together on these two issues, because they are tied together. It transcends borders, it transcends cultures, and it certainly transcends politics.”
That’s a fact that should be remembered by U.S. policymakers, who can honor America’s history of global leadership by responding to the coronavirus crisis both within and beyond this country’s borders."
"May 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/poor-states-aren-t-responsible-for-poorly-run-states/570127102/,StarTribune,Aid shouldn't fund bailout for poorly run states,"If you’re a taxpayer from a well-run state with low public worker union pension debt, you may be watching in horrified fascination as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushes the political buttons for the new CARES Act 2 federal coronavirus relief bill.
People and businesses need help. Government shut down the economy to deal with the pandemic. There are serious coronavirus costs and federal help is needed.
But what’s worrisome is this: Politics could morph necessary relief into a massive, no-strings-attached bailout for Illinois, New York, New Jersey and other poorly run states to pay down their unfunded public worker pension debts.
And who pays? You do.
It’s like watching your grandma take your college fund to pay off her brother’s gambling debts.
Democratic governors such as J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andrew Cuomo of New York are putting on the pressure, saying if that federal pipeline doesn’t start flowing again it will prove the Republicans and President Donald Trump just don’t care about human suffering.
It all reminds me of a guy who knew a lot about politics and human nature: Paul Ricca, the boss of bosses of organized crime in America.
Ricca was ruthless — a killer. He detested publicity, flew under the radar. Hollywood never made a movie about him. He was brilliant, educated in a seminary and is said to have spoken several languages.
From the time he came to Chicago to watch over Al Capone — the publicity seeking buffoon fronted off to the public and the press as the beclowned mob boss — and until he took his last breath, Ricca’s word was law. From New York to Los Angeles to Las Vegas and, naturally, Chicago.
Legend has it that one day Ricca was being driven along Cermak Road, named to honor a Chicago mayor who died suddenly of lead poisoning, when someone in the car began complaining about another gangster.
The guy in Ricca’s car wanted the other gangster to die a slow painful death from cancer.
“Stop. That’s a terrible thing for you to say, that he should get cancer,” Ricca said. “Cancer? How could you say such a thing? You wish that kind of suffering on someone? That’s terrible.”
The other guy in the car was terrified, thinking he’d angered the boss. Ricca was silent for a moment, then asked:
“Do you really hate this man?”
Yes.
“Then don’t wish him to have cancer. Wish him to be a gambler,” the boss said. “It takes longer.”
And Ricca smiled.
How long has it taken for suffering taxpayers in Illinois and the other poorly run states to drown in red ink from massive unfunded public pension debt liabilities?
Decades.
The Democratic governors have their talking points. This isn’t a bailout, they say. Instead, it’s all about “fairness” and “donor states.”
“As you know, we are a donor state to the federal government,” Pritzker said the other day. “We pay more in federal taxes in Illinois than we get back from the federal government. The states who are being bailed out, year after year, are the states who take more out of the federal dole than they put in.”
The Democratic talking points sound reasonable, until you realize the states Pritzker says are being “bailed out, year after year,” are, in the main, extremely poor states, with many poor people who need federal assistance programs.
And the new talking points ignore something else: the structural political issues that have led several states to mortgage their taxpayers’ futures and seek a federal bailout.
A bailout, a no-strings-attached grant of billions in federal cash, is like giving money to a desperate gambler. Or like putting cash into the hands of a meth addict.
Long before the coronavirus pandemic gave Democrats a crisis they could use to do things they’d never done before, states such as Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and even Kentucky were in the grips of something else that was killing them.
The political class in each of these states, mostly Democrats but with help from a few local Republican handmaidens, had put taxpayers on the hook for unsustainable public pension deals for government workers.
Rather than fund the pensions, the politicians just kicked the can down the road for the next political crew to deal with. And they kicked it too.
Years ago, as handing out political patronage jobs was deemed illegal, the old local Democratic political organizations began to fade. The politicians needed new armies with muscle at election time. The public worker union bosses stepped in and thus began the destructive symbiotic relationship.
The political class overpromised on pension deals. The public worker unions got the Democrats elected. In states such as New York and Illinois, some politicians leveraged public office for great private wealth. And who paid? Taxpayers.
Now in Illinois, the unfunded public worker pension debt is estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The state’s bond ratings are just above junk status. Illinois state Senate President Don Harmon has asked Congress for a $41.6 billion bailout.
Taxpayers are on the hook and the pension burden shifts to property taxes. The property taxes rise and home values fall. Taxpayers are now the servants of public servants.
Coronavirus didn’t do this. Trump didn’t do this. Local politicians did this.
So why should taxpayers of well-run and prudent states be asked to bail out the politicians of Illinois and elsewhere for decades worth of bad decisionmaking?
The politicians and mouthpieces will prattle on about “fairness” and “donor states.” But they’re very much like bust-out gamblers. They want someone else to pay their debts.
And the bill is due.
Paul Ricca understood them well."
"May 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-budget-chief-sees-deficit-from-pandemic-costs/570121082/,StarTribune,Minnesota budget chief sees likely deficit from pandemic costs,"Minnesota’s top budget official is expecting the state to slip into the red for the first time in years, as revenue drops and costs increase to battle the coronavirus pandemic.
An updated budget projection on Tuesday is likely to show the first notable deficit since the state crawled its way out of the Great Recession, triggering a little-known state law that allows lawmakers to dip into a more than $2 billion reserve fund to stop the bleeding.
“I can’t imagine we’re not in a deficit situation,” said Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Myron Frans, qualifying that he hasn’t seen the final numbers yet. State officials usually get economic forecasts twice a year, in February and November. But the financial uncertainty caused by the pandemic prompted an unprecedented additional budget projection update in May.
Without an updated projection, lawmakers legally can’t dip into the state’s budget reserve account, which was created in 2014 after years of patching deficits. The budget reserve law required automatic transfers to an account when the state budget was overflowing.
That reserve is now up to $2.359 billion, Frans said, not including a more flexible cash-flow account of $350 million.
“Just think what it would be like if we had not put that money away and we had given it back in tax relief. Just think what we would be doing right now,” he said. “I feel sorry for states that have not prepared themselves for this like we have.”
It’s a dramatic turnaround from February, when the state’s economic forecast projected a $1.5 billion budget surplus. Since then, positive cases of COVID-19 in the state have topped more than 5,000 and Gov. Tim Walz shuttered schools, bars, restaurants and other public spaces to slow the spread of the virus. More than 580,000 Minnesotans have filed for unemployment since mid-March.
Tax collections from February and March were $103 million less than projected in the economic forecast, and tax filing deadlines have been delayed into the summer.
The state has received nearly $2 billion in aid from the federal government, but in most cases it can be used only to cover specific COVID-19 related costs. It cannot be used to make up for lost revenue during the pandemic.
Legislators, who were planning to spend the surplus on projects from classrooms to tax cuts, have already dramatically tamped down expectations.
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, acknowledged that the length and shape of the economic recovery remains a “great unknown about the future.”
“There are still some areas I think we should spend money, and that’s why we provided resources for the governor for COVID-19 and that’s why we’re doing some mostly one-time spending on the tax bill,” he said Thursday, adding that a bonding bill also remains a priority.
Sen. Dick Cohen, DFL-St. Paul, said this week that the “simple arithmetic” suggests that right now, if lawmakers did nothing else, the state would face a deficit of about $200 million. The situation could worsen in the second quarter, which covers April through June.
“That will be the end of the budget reserve,” he said during a floor debate over new tax breaks. “That means we have no money left, no money left to do anything for the rest of the year relative to the COVID crisis. … We will have our hands tied in what is the biggest health crisis this country has faced arguably since the 1918 flu pandemic.”
But House Democrats are advocating to spend some now to help Minnesotans later, pushing an economic assistance package that would direct more state money for housing assistance, health workers and school employees.
House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, said the need is “to save lives now but also to make sure that we are ready to come back economically afterwards.”
“Despite the challenges and uncertainties ahead of us, we are confident in our ability to pull through,” he said."
"May 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-small-businesses-bear-biggest-burden-of-the-covid-recession/570130712/,StarTribune,Minnesota's small businesses bear biggest burden of the COVID recession,"Pub owner Mike Mulrooney, like many small-business owners, is being forced by the coronavirus shutdown into decisions he never thought he would have to make.
Mulrooney, who owns pubs Pog Mahone’s in downtown Minneapolis and Blarney Pub in Dinkytown, closed them both on St. Patrick’s Day, missing a big day for Irish-themed joints.
Last Thursday, he and other Minnesota pub owners learned they wouldn’t be able to open Monday. Gov. Tim Walz extended for two weeks a stay-home order and restrictions on most businesses, though he allowed some retailers to offer curbside pickup.
It will be next week before Walz decides whether he will allow other businesses to open on May 18.
Mulrooney said he needs downtown to reopen soon, at least partly. And he needs flexibility on government-guaranteed loans to get through the next few months.
“We’ve lost $500,000 to $700,000 in revenue between the two businesses,” Mulrooney said. “And if school at the University of Minnesota is canceled in the fall, that will end small business in Dinkytown.
“The governor needs to say where we’re going. If June 1, fine. I can live with that. There’s an issue of public health and also an issue of the economy. I’ll need the help of both my landlords. But I’m sitting on a pile of cash that can only be used for payroll. And there’s only two of us working. Why can’t I use some of that for rent?”
Mulrooney received a loan of more than $150,000 from the federal government’s Payroll Protection Program. It is forgivable if at least 75% of the funds are used to pay employees within two months of receipt of the loan. Mulrooney’s furloughed employees are collecting unemployment from the state, plus $600 weekly in federal payments.
Mulrooney said he doesn’t begrudge them downtime compensation that can total more than their wages. Many have children who are home. However, he wants some flexibility on the SBA loan.
“I don’t know that anyone has come up with a way to solve this, other than relief from the SBA,’’ said Levi Smith, a business lawyer with Fredrikson & Byron who is on the firm’s COVID-19 team. “As the law is written, the forgiveness period is only for the eight-week period that begins on the date that the lender disburses the loan to the borrower.
“The problem is that some of the business owners don’t have sufficient payroll costs because they are essentially closed and at least most of the employees are not working. We’re advising business owners to keep really good records of how they are using the loan proceeds. My understanding is that the lenders will make that decision based on guidance of the SBA.”
The original wave of $349 billion in payroll loans were first disbursed in mid-April. The federal Small Business Administration has acknowledged the payout conundrum for small businesses that can’t reopen and indicated there may be flexibility.
“The rules around this are being further defined on nearly a daily basis,” Rob Scott, administrator for the SBA’s Great Lakes region, said in a prepared statement to the Star Tribune last week.
Mike and Ann Roess own the downtown building that’s home to Pog Mahone’s as well as small shopping malls in Burnsville and Woodbury.
“All of our [25] tenants who are payroll-protection loan recipients are saying the same thing: ‘I need more than eight weeks to spend this money,’ ” Ann Roess said.
One tenant in Burnsville, a Jimmy John’s franchisee, is doing a trickle of business and customers can’t go in the store to be served. Three-location Elements Massage, which operates a location at the Roesses’ Woodbury mall, is precluded from opening. Similarly, Jenny Lam, the owner of Pro Nails in Burnsville had hoped to reopen on Monday.
“They spent on fabricating flexible shields for their nail stations, as well as plastic gloves and masks,” Mike Roess said.
Mulrooney paid full April rent of $10,800 downtown, one of the few tenants of the Roesses’ to do so. He can’t use any more of the $43,000 of his Pog Mahones SBA loan for rent under existing rules.
“I don’t have the money for May rent,” Mulrooney said. “If the landlords don’t get paid, their banks don’t get their mortgage payment. I think I should be able to use more of the money to pay rent. At least until the employees can come back.”
Commissioner Steve Grove of the state economic development agency, son of a small-business owner, acknowledged last week that the commercial hardship since March has been disproportionately borne by small enterprises. The likes of giants Target, Walmart, Hy-Vee and even liquor stores are considered “essential,” open and bustling.
Regulators and public health officials, assuming Minnesota continues to make progress against the virus, need to articulate the rules on seating distance, masks, gloves and otherwise that will let bars and restaurants start to plan a future later this month."
"May 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/as-clinic-access-falls-more-opting-for-telemedicine-abortion/570104212/,StarTribune,"As clinic access falls, more opting for telemedicine abortion","Ashley Dale was grateful she could end her pregnancy at home.
As her 3-year-old daughter played nearby, she spoke by video from her living room in Hawaii with Dr. Bliss Kaneshiro, an obstetrician-gynecologist, who was a 200-mile plane ride away in Honolulu. The doctor explained that two medicines that would be mailed to Dale would halt her pregnancy and cause a miscarriage.
“Does it sound like what you want to do in terms of terminating the pregnancy?” Kaneshiro asked gently. Dale, who said she would love to have another baby, had wrestled with the decision, but circumstances involving an estranged boyfriend had made the choice clear: “It does,” she replied.
Abortion through telemedicine is a quietly growing phenomenon, driven in part by restrictions from conservative states and the Trump administration that have limited access and increased the distance many women must travel to abortion clinics. Now, the coronavirus pandemic is catapulting demand for telemedicine abortion to a new level, with much of the nation under strict stay-at-home advisories and as several states, including Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, have sought to suspend access to surgical abortions during the crisis.
The telemedicine program that Dale participated in has been allowed to operate as a research study for several years under a special arrangement with the Food and Drug Administration. It allows women seeking abortions to have video consultations with certified doctors and then receive abortion pills by mail to take on their own. The FDA declined to answer questions about the program.
Over the past year, the program, called TelAbortion, has expanded from serving five states to serving 13, adding two of those — Illinois and Maryland — as the coronavirus crisis exploded. Not including those new states, about twice as many women had abortions through the program in March and April as in January and February.
Amid the pandemic, TelAbortion is “working to expand to new states as fast as possible,” said Dr. Elizabeth Raymond, senior medical associate at Gynuity Health Projects, which runs the program. It is also hearing from more women in neighboring states seeking to cross state lines so TelAbortion can serve them.
As of April 22, TelAbortion had mailed a total of 841 packages containing abortion pills and confirmed 611 completed abortions, Raymond said. Another 216 participants were either still in the follow-up process or have not been in contact to confirm their results. The program’s growth is significant enough that Republican senators recently introduced a bill to ban telemedicine abortion.
Abortion through medication, first approved by the FDA in 2000, is increasingly becoming women’s preferred method. Recent research estimated that about 60% of abortion patients early enough in pregnancy to be eligible — 10 weeks pregnant or less — chose medication abortion over suction or surgery.
But the FDA requires that the first drug in the two-medication regimen, mifepristone, be dispensed in clinics or hospitals by specially certified doctors or other medical providers.
The FDA rules, however, do not specify that providers must see patients in person, so some clinics have begun allowing women to come in for video consultations with certified doctors based elsewhere. TelAbortion goes further, offering telemedicine consultations to women at home (or anywhere), mailing them pills and following up after women take them.
In interviews, seven women who terminated pregnancies through TelAbortion described the conflicting emotions and intricate logistics that can accompany a decision to have an abortion, and their reasons for choosing to do it through telemedicine.
Dale, a single mother, was about to start a job at a storage center when she became pregnant last year. She would have had to fly to Honolulu, incurring expenses for travel and child care.
“The alternative would be to wait for a doctor to come to my island in three weeks,” Dale, 35, said. By then, she would be too far into the pregnancy for a medication abortion.
But many TelAbortion patients live near clinics. Shiloh Kirby, 24, of Denver, who said she had become pregnant after being raped, chose TelAbortion for convenience and privacy. She conducted her video consultation while sitting in her car in the parking lot of the hardware store where she worked.
Dawn, 30, a divorced mother of two who asked to be identified only by her first name, was terrified that the debilitating postpartum depression she experienced after her children’s births would return if she continued her pregnancy. And she worried protesters at her local Planned Parenthood in Salem, Oregon, might recognize her.
“I just don’t want to deal with that ridicule,” she said.
Based on state laws governing telemedicine and abortion, Raymond estimated TelAbortion might be legal in slightly more than half of the states, including some conservative ones. It now serves Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Washington.
The doctors (and nurses or midwives in some states) who do TelAbortion’s video consultations must be licensed in states where medication is mailed, but do not have to practice there. Likewise, patients do not have to live in the states that TelAbortion serves; they just have to be in one of them during the videoconference and provide an address there — that of a friend, relative, even a motel or post office — to which pills can be shipped.
“We have had patients who cross state lines in order to receive TelAbortions,” Raymond said. More are expected to do so during the pandemic. This month, a woman from Texas drove 10 hours in snowy weather to New Mexico, where she stayed in a motel for her videoconference and to receive the pills.
TelAbortion reports that of the 611 completed abortions documented through April 22, most were accomplished with only the pills and without complications. In 26 cases, aspiration was performed to finish the termination.
Raymond said 46 women went to emergency rooms or urgent care centers with issues that appear just as likely to have occurred if the women had followed the common practice of visiting abortion clinics for consultations, taking the first medication there and the second at home. Fifteen ended up needing no medical treatment. Some were given medicine for pain or nausea.
Three were hospitalized, all successfully treated: two women had excessive bleeding, and another had a seizure after an aspiration, Raymond said.
Eleven women decided not to have abortions and did not take the pills they were sent. Another woman continued her pregnancy after the medication failed, as did another after vomiting the mifepristone. Sixteen women have undergone two telabortions, Raymond said.
TelAbortion typically charges $200 to $375 for consultations and pills. Women must also pay for an ultrasound and lab tests, obtained from any provider. During the pandemic, TelAbortion may waive its requirement for an ultrasound to gauge the gestational age of the pregnancy if women are unable to visit a doctor to obtain one, Raymond said.
In some states, some or all of the costs are covered by private insurance or Medicaid. For women facing financial hardship, like Kirby in Denver, the program taps abortion grant networks.
Some patients said the teleconsultations helped them navigate the complex feelings that abortion can evoke.
Dale’s consultation and lab tests were covered by Hawaii public assistance. The pills, which cost her $135, arrived by certified mail. She placed them on a table near two pregnancy ultrasound photos.
“I’ve got a beautiful daughter and I’d really love to have another one,” she said. “But it’s just not feasible for my sanity, and I feel like I’d basically be guaranteeing us to live in poverty.”
On the back of an ultrasound picture, she wrote: “Never forget why you had to make the hard decision to let this baby go.”
She had Sophia stay at her mother’s house and took the other tablets, which she said felt like chalk in her mouth. To distract from seven hours of cramping and heavy bleeding, she watched back-to-back “Matrix” movies. “It’s not like it was easy,” she reflected later, “but at the same time it’s pretty clearly the right choice.”"

Confirmed deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 illness, meanwhile, have shot past 63,000. That kind of national tragedy can even make the bounce back in stock prices upsetting.
It’s not easy to explain why the breathtaking declines in the U.S. stock markets as the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated in February and March was followed by a broad rally much of the way back up. That’s because it’s not easy to understand.
In the case of the closely watched Nasdaq index, even after a rough end of the week it was down only about 12% from its all-time closing high. Meanwhile, the economy only seems to be getting worse.
“The U.S. economy was already experiencing a catastrophe within two weeks of the lockdowns going into effect [in March] and the second quarter will be far worse,” the chief U.S. economist from the firm Capital Economics wrote last week, while reminding clients that the firm’s forecast of overall economic output for the three months ending in June is down 40%, annualized.
The word unprecedented became tiresome weeks ago, so let’s just call this economic collapse something we don’t remember seeing before.
The stock market is made up of pieces of businesses, of course, and what’s important in deciding what they are worth is how well the ­businesses are going to perform in the months and years ahead, not so much how they did last month.
And the simple explanation for why the markets recovered is that hopefully April was the low point in the coronavirus crisis, and the calendar has already turned to May.
That’s consistent with the best explanation for what’s happened I got last week, which was from Jim Paulsen, chief strategist with Minneapolis investment firm the Leuthold Group. The pandemic-related recession and reaction, he explained, has all been happening at “warp speed.”
In a normal recession, he said, “You have to debate if it’s coming.”
Much like there’s no need to check the weather app on your smartphone for the chance of rain when standing in a driving rainstorm, this time no one had to check any formal measure of economic strength or had any reason to doubt that a painful recession was underway.
So financial-market values reacted at warp speed, too, as the broad stock market measures fell dramatically in just weeks all the while the reported economic data was still good.
But central bankers and government officials also have never acted so swiftly before, either.
Financial assistance legislation that included the Payroll Protection Program was signed by the president on March 27, a few days after the Federal Reserve announced it would use its “full range of tools” to support households and businesses through the economic storm caused by the pandemic.
The day of the Fed’s statement would have been a good day for traders to buy U.S. stocks, as that week marked the recent low point.
In the meantime, though, there continues to be nothing but bad economic news.
Last week, there was an almost unbelievable number reported for a contraction in spending on services in the first quarter, particularly given the broad public health measures like “safer at home” didn’t get implemented in big states like California until nearly three weeks into March.
Compared to spending on costly items like cars and business equipment, consumer spending on services is usually pretty steady in economic downturns as people will still go to their haircut and dental appointments. Until this time, of course.
The monthly jobs report comes next week, and the forecasts point to a loss of more than 20 million jobs and an unemployment percentage rate that has shot well into the teens.
As to what could delay or derail a broad economic recovery, it’s really dependent on the course of the coronavirus pandemic and the success of our collective efforts to contain it. That includes adapting to social distancing practices that are going to be necessary for some time.
Economic forecasts are always uncertain, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week, but with the pandemic there is a whole new layer of unknowns.
He didn’t seem to be trying to provide a forecast last week, by the way, just assuring the public that the Fed stood ready to do what it could to support American households and businesses. Yet he pointed out that the recovery might not be a steady pickup in activity from a really bad April, with more bad months in the pandemic potentially lying ahead.
“The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy’s healing, where we have the disease under control, where we don’t, you know, take too much risk of second and third waves and that sort of thing,” he said.
Surges of additional infections, second or third waves as he alluded to, could knock back economic activity as workers and customers stay home again, even if state and local governments don’t once again decide they must require that.
So maybe that’s one way to look at the stock market. It’s far too fickle to be trusted, but its recovery at least suggests that a rocky, up-and-down path ahead doesn’t look most likely right now.
So whether savers have any money in stock funds or not, some recovery in the stock market wasn’t a bad thing to see as an awful month came to a close."
"May 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-house-gop-to-block-bonding-bill-until-walz-executive-orders-end/570146771/,StarTribune,Minnesota House GOP to block bonding bill until Gov. Walz's emergency powers end,"The top Minnesota House Republican said Saturday his caucus will block passage of a public infrastructure borrowing package until the peacetime state of emergency Gov. Tim Walz has used to enact the stay-at-home order and other coronavirus response measures comes to an end.
House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said his position on the bonding bill reflects a belief that “it’s important that the Legislature be involved in the decisionmaking process” about how to address the pandemic.
“The Legislature is in session,” he said. “ ... We believe we should be working with the governor on the response to COVID-19 and keeping Minnesota safe.”
Walz and legislative leaders in both parties have said they want to pass a borrowing bill that will quickly create jobs through public construction projects, though they remain split on how much debt the state should take on.
Daudt’s opposition could further complicate efforts to reach a deal before the Legislature adjourns May 18: Unlike other measures, the bonding bill needs support of minority parties in both chambers to meet the three-fifths threshold for passage.
House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said it is “disappointing to see the minority leader threaten to block much-needed investments in local jobs and projects in our communities.”
“Governor Walz and his Administration have served the people of Minnesota well during this crisis, and his thoughtfulness is why Minnesotans overwhelmingly approve of his actions,” she said in a statement. “Ending the peacetime emergency declaration before the emergency has passed would be reckless.”
Saturday’s announcement reflects mounting frustration among Republicans about the DFL governor’s use of executive power during the pandemic. The peacetime state of emergency, initially declared March 13, gives Walz broad authority to respond to the crisis. Actions have included closing schools and nonessential businesses, directing relief to employers and employees and issuing the statewide stay-at-home order, which was recently extended through May 18.
Most governors across the country have used emergency executive powers to respond to the crisis and a federal emergency declaration signed by President Donald Trump remains in effect. A spokesman for Walz defended the administration’s actions, saying the governor is working with legislators and governors from both parties and the White House “to keep Minnesotans safe.”
”The governor is committed to getting Minnesotans back to work safely and he’s asked the Legislature to join him by passing a robust Local Jobs and Projects Plan,” spokesman Teddy Tschann said.
The state of emergency, currently to end May 13, does not require legislative sign off, though lawmakers can vote to end it. House Republicans have made several unsuccessful attempts to pass legislation rescinding the order. The governor can extend the measure every 30 days with approval from an executive council of statewide elected officials, though he must call back the Legislature if he acts again after it has adjourned. Daudt said he would rather see the Legislature remain in session without a state of emergency past May to approve any virus response measures.
“We feel that this has gone on for basically two months now where’s we’ve had unilateral decisionmaking by the executive,” Daudt said. “I feel like more eyes and more minds in this process are going to give us better decisions.”
Daudt said he’s open to passing a bonding bill during a special session later this year if the state of emergency continues through the summer, though he said he also has concerns about high amounts of borrowing given the economic downturn."

Doctors and hospitals credit public adherence to a stay-at-home order from Gov. Tim Walz with slowing an expected surge of COVID-19 patients, but the political consequences were on display Saturday in the form of protests at the State Capitol and a threat by Republican lawmakers to withhold support for key public infrastructure legislation.
House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said his caucus will block passage of a public infrastructure borrowing package until the peacetime state of emergency Walz has used to enact the stay-at-home order and other coronavirus response measures comes to an end.
“We feel that this has gone on for basically two months now where we’ve had unilateral decisionmaking by the executive,” Daudt said. “I feel like more eyes and more minds in this process are going to give us better decisions.”
Despite the opposition, polling suggests most Americans support continued social distancing rules as a means of combating the virus, which caused 24 more deaths and nearly 500 newly confirmed cases in Minnesota, the state said Saturday. One of the deaths involved a Hennepin County resident in their 40s with no underlying health conditions who did not live in a long-term care community.
“No one is free of risk from this disease,” said Dr. Cindy Firkins Smith, a past president of the Minnesota Medical Association who practices in Willmar, the west-central Minnesota city seeing a cluster of COVID patients who work in poultry processing.
The statewide toll is now 395 deaths, according to data posted Saturday by the Minnesota Department of Health. All but three of the new deaths reported were residents of long-term care facilities. Long-term care residents account for about 80% of the state’s deaths.
“We are going to continue to see deaths,” Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease at the Health Department, said via e-mail. “The good news is that we have tamped down the curve — our acute care is not overwhelmed.”
Walz and legislative leaders in both parties have said they want to pass a borrowing bill that will create jobs through public construction projects before the session ends May 18. They remain split on how much debt the state should take on.
Daudt’s opposition could thwart efforts to reach a deal in the session’s final weeks. Unlike other measures, the bonding bill needs support of minority parties in both chambers. House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, called Daudt’s statement “disappointing.
“Ending the peacetime emergency declaration before the emergency has passed would be reckless,” she said.
Republicans in both chambers have raised concerns about the DFL governor’s use of executive power during the pandemic. The peacetime state of emergency, initially declared March 13, gives Walz broad authority to respond to the crisis without legislative approval. It does not require legislative signoff, however, though lawmakers can vote to end it. House Republicans’ attempts to rescind the order have failed.
Governors across the country have used emergency executive powers to respond to the crisis, and a federal emergency declaration signed by President Donald Trump remains in effect.
Teddy Tschann, a spokesman for Walz, defended the administration’s actions, saying, “The governor is committed to getting Minnesotans back to work safely, and he’s asked the Legislature to join him by passing a robust Local Jobs and Projects Plan.”
The extended stay-at-home order provides new flexibility for some retailers to reopen with curbside pickup or delivery for customers.
On Saturday, a “drive-in rally” protesting Walz’s handling of the shutdown drew a steady stream of vehicles past the State Capitol. Roughly 100 people stood on the sidewalk in front of the building, some waving signs and flags and at least half a dozen carrying guns. Only a few wore masks and many stood within inches of one another.
A group of counterprotesters, all wearing masks, formed a line across a street leading to nearby Bethesda Hospital. They said they were keeping the route open in case an ambulance needed to get through.
While Republicans have raised concerns about the impact of restrictions on the economy, GOP governors in states from Georgia to Ohio have had varied responses to the pandemic.
On Thursday, after Walz extended his stay-at-home order, the Minnesota Hospital Association issued a statement urging residents “to continue to practice diligent social distancing in public and to stay at home whenever possible.” The Minnesota Medical Association said it supported the governor’s move as the best way to save lives.
“April was a very important month of preparation for our hospitals and clinics,” said Dr. Keith Stelter, president of the Minnesota Medical Association, via e-mail. “The time we all spent staying at home and doing social distancing was extremely valuable, because the predicted extreme peak did not occur before we could make these preparations.”
Minnesota and Wisconsin currently face decisions on whether to stay the course with social restrictions that are similar to those in place in Norway, or adopt the model of Sweden, with more relaxed rules, said Thomas Oliver, a professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Following Sweden’s example will bring more death and illness, Oliver said.
The number of known COVID-19 cases in Minnesota increased Saturday from 5,730 to 6,228. People 65 and older, as well as those living in long-term care facilities and those with underlying medical conditions are at greater risk from COVID-19. Those conditions range from lung disease, serious heart conditions and cancer to severe obesity, diabetes and kidney patients who need dialysis.
The death reported Saturday of a person in their 40s who apparently didn’t have those problems shows “there are still going to be some occasional cases of people who are under the age of 65 who don’t have an apparent risk factor who do get severe disease,” said Dr. Jack O’Horo, an infectious disease physician at the Mayo Clinic."
"May 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mayo-clinic-s-coronavirus-research-task-force-is-in-a-desperate-race-against-time/570146491/,StarTribune,Mayo Clinic's coronavirus research task force is in a desperate race against time,"Like the rest of the world, the Mayo Clinic’s Dr. Andrew Badley hadn’t heard of the deadly virus scientists refer to as SARS-CoV-2 until reports emerged from China in December. But it was as if his nearly four decades as an infectious disease specialist had prepared him for this moment.
Now Badley, a 55-year-old HIV research specialist as comfortable in the lab as he is bedside in a clinic, chairs the Mayo Clinic’s novel coronavirus research task force, an urgent operation that is quite literally all hands on deck.
The budget? In a time of austerity, that’s a complicated question — but he has Mayo’s full support for researchers and talent. The timeline? As fast as scientifically possible.
When the Mayo Clinic — one of the world’s top research hospitals, with more than 4,000 full-time research personnel — tapped Badley to lead the task force that approves COVID-19 research proposals, he became the lead of one of the most aspirational projects in medicine. More than half of Mayo’s research staff is working on coronavirus-related projects.
“Mayo can do big things,” said Dr. James Cerhan, a Mayo epidemiologist on Badley’s task force. “But this is once in a generation, once in 100 years, that we’ve had to organize like this so fast, both on the clinical and research sides.”
When Vice President Mike Pence visited Mayo last week, Badley was part of his tour, explaining Mayo’s portfolio of COVID research projects. He told the vice president the scientific world is in a much better place with COVID-19 than in the early days of HIV, when it took months to find the virus, years to understand the viral proteins and more than a decade to create drugs that target those proteins. With COVID-19, the virus was identified within weeks, and roughly 800 clinical trials are already underway worldwide for potential therapies.
n a career dedicated to fighting one of history’s most destructive pandemics — HIV has killed some 32 million worldwide to date — Badley’s life since mid-March has felt like a scientific déjà vu: a new path strikingly similar to one he’s trod before, only with a much accelerated pace.
“From day one we were being inundated with ideas,” Badley said. “The interest and dedication and outpouring of thought and ideas in the scientific community — within Mayo and around the globe — is stunning.”
On the fifth floor of Mayo’s nearly century-old Plummer Building in Rochester, this ambitious project has taken shape over the past seven weeks. Think of it as Mayo’s pandemic version of the Manhattan Project, the World War II effort to build the first atomic bomb: a sudden and relentless race against time, with scientists furiously researching as millions of lives around the world hang in the balance.
Badley holes up in a conference room alongside his co-chair, Amanda Mikhail, an operations administrator in research — the business-side yin to Badley’s scientific yang. Two whiteboards are filled with Mayo’s active COVID-19 drug trials; Mayo, with pharmaceutical partners, has already activated or will soon activate nine separate COVID-19 drug trials. They’ve pored over more than 500 research proposals and approved, as of last week, 109, ranging from ideas for vaccines to studies on how certain populations combat the virus, from ways to recycle masks to ways to better provide oxygen to patients, from research on community response to studies on outcomes of recovered patients.
This war room is the first point of contact for proposals — Mayo physicians and researchers were told in March to e-mail ideas directly to the duo — and where the research is ultimately approved. But approval comes only after passing through experts in each field.
“Nothing at Mayo happens with just one person,” Badley said.
The work is equal parts exhausting and invigorating. Coffee cups and PowerBar wrappers overflow the wastebasket alongside takeout containers; roast beef and Gouda sandwiches from Rochester’s City Market are lunch staples.
“It’s kind of like air traffic control in a blizzard,” said Mikhail, the co-chair. “It has to be very, very precise, the things we’re doing and bringing to our patients, yet it’s coming at us from so many different angles.”
Badley has constructed 16 independent, parallel working groups, filled with subject matter experts in each field, who review proposals. He connects researchers across specialties who have submitted related research proposals. The goal is to rigorously follow the scientific process, but to do so as quickly as possible. Steps to approve a clinical trial were once sequential but are now parallel, and clinical trials can go from an idea to activated in days.
“It took a decade-plus for good HIV drugs,” Badley said. “I believe we can get good drugs for COVID certainly within a year, possibly sooner.”
HIV and the novel coronavirus are “almost superimposable Venn diagrams,” Badley said. “If you take a step back and ask, ‘How is it an infection harms a human body?’ It’s not because you have the virus in you. It’s because your body reacts to having that virus in you.”
Many scientific leaders in the coronavirus battle — such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — came of age through cutting-edge research into the human immunodeficiency virus that once confounded clinicians and researchers. That was Badley’s path, from the dark days of the 1980s, when many of his patients died each week, to the joyful days of the late 1990s, when therapeutic breakthroughs turned a corner on the virus that still has not been eradicated but that Badley now calls a “chronic manageable condition.”
Growing up in rural Nova Scotia, Badley swore he’d never follow in the footsteps of his gastroenterologist father. But when he went to an infectious disease seminar as a teen in the early 1980s, a physician spoke about his experience in Africa treating a new disease called HIV, which had yet to proliferate in North America. Badley heard about the high rate of illness and death and the increasing number of orphans. The doctor predicted it would spread globally.
“I was terrified, absolutely terrified — for people, for myself, for the planet,” Badley said. That moment led Badley to study immunology and virology, graduating from medical school at Dalhousie University in Halifax before heading to Rochester for his residency at the Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education.
For Badley, it became less a job, more a calling. Early in the epidemic came a defining moment. A new patient was in advanced stages of AIDS. Badley felt helpless, unable to offer hope against a virus the scientific community knew little about. The patient died in isolation. The moment clarified the disease’s terrifying outcomes and the urgency of Badley’s mission.
He was also there for the breakthroughs. In the late 1990s he was at a University of Ottawa center that had early access to protease inhibitors, one of the first successful HIV drugs. Deaths dropped. Sick patients became healthy six or nine months after starting on the drug regimen.
“When the number of cases in our clinic started to drop, it was profound,” Badley said. “Virus replication went down, the immune system got better, the patient felt better. Optimism, enthusiasm, absolute joy.”
Badley doesn’t like to sit still. A friend called him “twitchy.” He loves fishing, but only fly fishing, an all-consuming distraction where he’s reading the water and air conditions, choosing between wet flies or dry flies or nymphs, calculating where to place the fly and how to present it. He keeps a hobby farm in Byron, but it’s not just a place to get away from the world; one recent evening just before sundown, Badley picked up his phone while tending to his bees.
Every weekend since the task force formed, his colleague and friend Dr. Patrick Dean has forced Badley to decompress for a couple hours of fly fishing at streams in Minnesota or northeast Iowa — places without cellphone service. (The doctors wear masks and gloves in Dean’s 20-year-old Chevy Tahoe.)
The first weekend, Badley, overwhelmed by it all, just sat on the bank and watched the world go by. By a recent weekend, he’d returned to his active self, catching a dozen or so fish and throwing them back.
“If you had to pick one person to be stranded on a desert island with, it’d be Andrew,” said Dean, who goes on annual South Dakota pheasant hunts with Badley and his bird dog, a Vizsla named Dexter. “He can build a house, harvest game and cook that game.”
Those varied interests are vital to the COVID-19 team’s approach. Badley sees one of his roles as getting researchers out of their silos to work across specialties with researchers pursuing similar proposals.
Colleague John O’Horo remembered early on when they reached a bottleneck. One chemical — a viral transport medium that gets samples off swabs and into testing machines — was back-ordered. O’Horo worried they may have to ramp down testing just as they were ramping it up.
Instead, Badley e-mailed a couple dozen microbiologists and asked about a substitute for the chemical. For a couple hours, e-mails flew back and forth until the microbiologists came up with an adequate replacement. Bottleneck averted.
“We have a rare thing where almost everybody in this institution is pulling toward the same projects in the same areas,” O’Horo said. “That’s moved things at an incredible rate.”
Success will come in multiple ways. Short term, Badley hopes to access promising experimental therapies for COVID-19 patients — and soon. Confidential information he’s seen from ongoing studies fuels an optimism that there will be effective drugs identified within a few months. Long term, he hopes for two things: that Mayo researchers can continue this momentum, and that awareness of public health’s importance brings increased funding on a national and global scale.
“It’s a truly remarkable alignment of forces,” Badley said. “A friend of mine told me that in times of crisis your personality is amplified, and I think that’s absolutely true. The number of good people doing great things now is stunning.”"

I should explain, and I will. First, let us consider a piece in the Washington Post. The writer had a novel idea — you could even say “novel coronavirus” idea, because that’s the prism through which all light must pass these days.
“The key to escaping lockdown? Sleep in your guest room and pretend it’s a trip.”
If you don’t have a guest room? Spend the night in a closet. Pretend you’re locked in an elevator in an exciting vacation destination! Why stop there? Fill a beanbag with Brie and pretend you’re on a hot-air balloon ride. Smear caviar all over the dog and pretend he’s ... I don’t know, the Queen’s naughtiest corgi.
We are past all the coping and “new normal” stuff and Zoom jokes and hardy-har tales of bartering Charmin for flour. That was forever ago. This is now, this is May. Mentally, we are done. Fiscally, many are tapped.
We’ve spent weeks feeling like a snail crawling on a cheese grater, and we’re itchy, techy, peeved, grouchy, like someone living over and over and over the day before his parole hearing.
How bad is it? In the last week I’ve seen at least three examples of people who were almost curt with a checkout clerk. In Minnesota terms, this means we are on the precipice of anarchy.
Well, OK, maybe not. But last week I had to go to the bank. There were three people in line outside the door, and everyone had a mask. It looked like a comedy about very polite bank robbers in Sweden, where people have a sense of civic responsibility.
“Axel, I see you, too, have come to rob the bank. But the bank is low on cash today, I understand. Hello, Oscar? Is that you? Have you come to rob as well? Gentlemen, I propose we go in one at a time, and only take a little. Agreed?”
“Well, when that fellow who’s in there now finishes robbing, one of us can go in next. Axel, why don’t you go first. No, I insist.”
The queue outside the bank wasn’t a surprise. This is a city where people form an orderly line to get on the bus. At this point the masks aren’t odd, either. I catch sight of myself in a mirrored window, wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses, and a mask, realize I look like an FBI Wanted sketch, and it’s normal.
It’s also slightly ridiculous, as the mask does not have a tight seal, and I’m walking on a deserted street that lacks only tumbleweeds and a sun-bleached cow skull to complete the picture of desolation. But hey — you never know. The Invisible Man could have uttered an explosive cough 3 feet ahead of me, and I could walk right into it. So mask up.
I also had gloves, because Lund’s got in a batch the other day. “Whoa, those will come in handy if I want to touch anything. On the other hand, I would have to touch the box to buy them. Maybe I can do a Chuck Norris move and knock one into my cart with my foot. No, my pants are too tight. Yes, this is exactly how I thought 2020 would go when we sang songs on New Year’s Eve: Pants too tight from lockdown bread to karate-kick protective gloves into the shopping cart.”
You’re being silly, I thought. You’re being paranoid. Just use your elbow.
Anyway, I had gloves on because I would have to enter my PIN at some point, and that reminded me of the madcap days of yore when we entered PINs with devil-may-care, bare-naked fingers. Those were the days when people would use touch screens to place orders at a fast-food restaurant and then pick up the food with their hands, which now seems like playing Russian roulette with a submachine gun.
There was one person ahead of me in line, and one behind me. A lady came up, unmasked, and asked if we were waiting to get into the bank.
You are tempted to say, “No, someone put these pictures of shoe-soles on the ground and covered them with a powerful adhesive; we’re all stuck in place, helpless. Have you any solvent? Turpentine might do. Yes! It is the line for the bank!”
But you don’t, because, well, it’s not nice. And you want to be nice.
Inside the bank the teller behind the plexiglass had a mask on. “Hwre you dunetdy?” She asked, which I eventually figured out was “how are you going today?” in muffled mask-speak.
“Mffly trrd ufal this,” I said. Mightily tired of all this.
We kept up some chipper small talk. It was halfhearted, but we tried. That’s what I’ve noticed about all such exchanges in the stores: People are trying to be nice. Keeping up the vestiges of conviviality, because the alternative is just sullen and depressing — and because you sense, or at least hope, that some loosening is en route soon.
Yes, loosening! We’re all in the mood to hear what’s loosened next. We’ve been in psychological straitjackets for weeks, and if they could slacken the straps that keep our arms fixed in place, that’d be great. You never think about scratching your nose until your arms are cinched, and then it’s a big deal.
The looser the straps, the itchier your nose. It is physically impossible to scratch your nose with your elbow, but if you were limber enough, you could use your heel — if you hadn’t bulked up from lockdown bread."
"May 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/wider-testing-drives-up-virus-count-but-most-recover/570163172/,StarTribune,"Wider testing drives up virus count, but most recover","Hundreds of Minnesotans were released from COVID-19 quarantine over the weekend as wider testing discovers more cases that aren’t ending in death or serious illness.
The weekend saw Minnesota continue its recent trend of adding several hundred new confirmed cases and a couple dozen deaths from the viral illness each day. The state surpassed 6,600 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the cumulative death count reached 419.
But the number of people reported as released from quarantine is increasing sharply. Data that the Minnesota Department of Health released Sunday showed that the number of people in that category grew almost 26% between just Friday and Saturday nights.
That included 594 people who recovered from their symptoms and stayed free of fever and respiratory problems for three days. The state also counted 24 people as no longer in isolation because they died.
Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director at the Minnesota Department of Health, said through a spokesman that the increase in recoveries likely stems from the overall increase in COVID-19 testing in Minnesota.
“Released from isolation is just a function of who was tested and who now has met the requisite time frame and does not have symptoms,” Ehresmann said Sunday via an e-mail from a Health Department spokesman.
All told, Minnesota has had 6,663 cases of COVID-19 confirmed with testing since the first case was diagnosed just over eight weeks ago in the state, including 435 cases added to the tally Sunday. Just over 3,000 people are no longer self-quarantining.
State officials have set aggressive goals for ramping up coronavirus testing while warning the public to expect increasing numbers of confirmed cases as surveillance efforts expand.
Hospitals and state public health officials have been reporting the results of more than 3,000 tests per day since Thursday.
The 3,323 completed tests that were included as part of Sunday’s data release fell well short of the goal of 20,000 tests per day that Gov. Tim Walz unveiled on April 22. State officials said it might take several weeks to reach the goal of maximizing testing capacity in the state.
Nearly 83,000 tests have been completed in Minnesota to detect the virus that causes COVID-19. All but 13,000 of them were conducted by private hospitals and laboratories, though all positive test results are reported to the state.
COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which surfaced last year in China and spread into a global pandemic that state officials have called an act of nature.
Dramatic public health efforts to limit the virus’ spread have led to closures of schools, many workplaces and public areas, and caused more than 30 million Americans to seek federal jobless benefits in the past six weeks.
Most people who get COVID-19 don’t suffer devastating illness, but a small proportion have organ failure or severe respiratory problems and end up in intensive care. Advanced age and underlying health conditions increase a person’s risks.
The epidemiology is still evolving, but the best reports available today say about 80% of COVID-19 cases involve mild to no symptoms and don’t require hospitalization. The portion who need critical care in a hospital is generally thought to be about 5%, though the severity estimate may decline as widespread testing reveals previously unknown cases.
The statistics released Sunday by the state’s Department of Health showed 373 people now in the hospital with COVID-19, including 155 in intensive care.
Public health officials in Minnesota have published a disease-progression model that assumes 27% of people ages 80 or older will need to be hospitalized if they get COVID-19, and 70% of those patients would be moved to intensive-care unit (ICU) beds in the hospital. The ICU is where invasive critical-care devices like mechanical ventilators are used, though not all ICU patients go on a ventilator.
Meanwhile, Minnesota’s epidemiological model assumed fewer than 5% of people younger than 50 would need hospitalization, and only 6% of them will need to be moved to the ICU once hospitalized.
Besides age and underlying health conditions, residing in a group-living facility can be a risk factor. Just over 80% of the fatalities in Minnesota have been residents of long-term care or assisted-living facilities. Twenty-one of the 24 deaths reported Sunday occurred in long-term care facilities.
In Winona County, residents of the Sauer Health Care facility for skilled nursing and hospice services accounted for at least 14 of that county’s 15 deaths from COVID-19, Jan Malcolm, Health Department commissioner, confirmed last week. That means about 20% of the 67 confirmed cases in the southeastern Minnesota county resulted in the deaths of people who lived at the same facility.
In Nobles County, in the southwestern part of the state, a fast-moving outbreak among working-age employees at the JBS USA pork-processing plant in Worthington led to mass testing that documented 940 cases as of Sunday. Yet the county has recorded just a single death from COVID-19.
In both counties, as in the rest of the state, health officials caution that a lack of widespread, reliable testing for COVID-19 means there’s no sure way to know how many cases truly exist in a given community or what the actual death rate is.
Because no test to detect COVID-19 is perfect and the virus can be spread by asymptomatic people, Walz has urged Minnesotans to wear protective masks in public to catch breath droplets that spread the virus.
“We continue our work along with many partners around the state to protect Minnesotans and prevent additional deaths,” Malcolm said Sunday in a statement. “It is very important for all Minnesotans to do their part in that effort by following social distancing guidelines and other public health recommendations.”
The state recommends people avoid gathering with others outside their homes and maintain 6 feet of space between themselves and others when they do have to leave. Residents should wash their hands often, cover coughs and sneezes, and regularly clean surfaces and objects that are touched often.
On Thursday, Walz extended a statewide stay-at-home order until May 18 that generally requires Minnesotans to remain at home and to work from home if possible, while allowing thousands of retail businesses to be open for delivery or curbside services.
The order strongly encourages, but does not mandate, that all residents wear manufactured or homemade face coverings in public places where it is hard to stay 6 feet apart at all times, such as the grocery store and other essential businesses."
"May 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/senate-gop-leader-says-he-won-t-delay-bonding-bill/570177872/,StarTribune,Minnesota Senate GOP leader says he won't delay bonding bill over Walz emergency powers,"Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said Monday he wants more legislative control over Gov. Tim Walz's coronavirus-related actions, but he does not want to force a showdown with the governor over a major construction bonding bill.
""The sooner we get to the legislative bodies working with the governor, the better off I think we'll be. But I'm not making that a condition of working on a bonding bill,"" Gazelka said.
GOP House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt said over the weekend that his caucus would block a state bonding bill until Walz's emergency powers end. The bill provides long-term financing for infrastructure projects around the state. It requires a three-fifths majority to pass the House, meaning Republican votes are necessary.
Under the existing makeup of the House, six Republicans would have to join Democrats for the measure to succeed. House Republicans thwarted a bonding bill last year and could do it again, Walz said Monday. The governor said the construction projects are needed and he has heard ""nothing other than positives"" about a borrowing bill to improve communities.
Walz also said the powers he has under a peacetime state of emergency have been critical to respond to the crisis. The emergency declaration has allowed Walz to issue stay-at-home orders, close schools and businesses and take other sweeping actions to respond quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic without legislative approval.
""If we had to wait to make some of the decisions we've made, I don't think we could have ever got there,"" Walz said. ""I think it would have been very, very difficult to build a coalition on testing. … Some of this just requires this.""
The current declaration of peacetime emergency is set to expire May 13, five days before the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn. The standoff with Daudt could intensify if the governor opts to extend his emergency powers for another 30 days.
""May 13th is a critical day … The farther we go, the more resistance you're going to see, because we think we should be working together, legislative body with the governor,"" Gazelka said.
Both the House and Senate would need to agree to override Walz and end the state of emergency, and House Democrats have rejected the GOP's previous attempts to end it. House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said in a statement over the weekend that ending the declaration before the emergency had passed would be ""reckless.""
Gazelka outlined three key issues he wants to iron out by the end of the session on May 18.
The GOP leader from East Gull Lake wants the Legislature to have oversight of the roughly $2 billion in federal funding the state has received to respond to the crisis. He also wants to pass a bonding bill, which could fund improvements to roads, wastewater systems, college and university campuses and other state and local infrastructure. And he hopes to reach a deal that provides tax relief to businesses and individuals by delaying tax payments and lifting penalties.
""Those are important things that I feel like we need to keep working [on] right to the end, and I don't want it to be sidetracked,"" Gazelka said.
However, he also continued his call for Walz to allow more businesses to reopen. Several businessmen and a pastor joined Gazelka and other Republicans at the Capitol on Monday to urge Walz to allow them to quickly reopen their businesses and church.
Matt Winter, an owner of PLate restaurant in Prior Lake, said without dine-in options his sales have dropped to just 20 to 40% of what they were before the coronavirus. He said they have come up with safety guidelines including sanitizing every 15 minutes, limiting how many guests can enter the restaurant at a time and having people wear masks and gloves.
""We would like to have an opportunity to do it safely in a legal way,"" Winter said.
Gazelka suggested the governor could allow certain areas of the state to open up before others. He also announced Monday that the Senate had created a COVID-19 Economic Recovery Taskforce to look into how to reopen businesses safely."
"May 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/no-trump-didn-t-order-meat-processing-plants-to-reopen/570177732/,StarTribune,"No, Trump didn't order meat-processing plants to reopen","Newspapers and television networks across the country reported last week that President Donald Trump had signed an executive order compelling meat-processing plants to remain open even as their employees test positive for the coronavirus in droves. Meat and poultry executives quickly praised the president's action, while unions condemned Trump's order for prioritizing industry interests above workers' lives. Predictably, Senate Republicans applauded the president, while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and congressional Democrats derided Trump's move. The nonprofit Environmental Working Group warned that Trump's order could be a ""death sentence"" for workers.
Lost amid all of this was the fact that Trump's order, which appeared on the White House website late Tuesday, does not actually order meat-processing plants to reopen. Indeed, it does not order the meat-processing plants to do anything. And although the president had told reporters Tuesday that his order would ""solve any liability problems"" that plants might face with respect to lawsuits arising from COVID-19 exposures, the order does not do that either. Far from a death warrant, it is a paper-thin proclamation with limited legal effect.
There is an important lesson to be learned from the episode, even though — or rather, precisely because — the reactions on both sides blew Trump's order out of proportion. The president's assertions of legal authority, like his off-the-cuff medical advice, often have little basis in reality. But our responses to the president's statements do matter, because we can transform his imaginations into facts on the ground. If employees return to work at meat-processing plants because of the president's order, then for all practical purposes, he does have the power that he asserts, even though no statute gives him that power and the order drafted by his lawyers doesn't compel anyone in a factory to do anything. Presidential power is, to a large extent, what all the rest of us make of it. Right now, we are making it out to be far too much.
Here's what Tuesday's order actually does. First, it declares that meat and poultry in the food supply chain fall under Section 101(b) of the Defense Production Act, a 1950 statute that has been invoked for hundreds of thousands of military purchases before. That, to be sure, is a dubious declaration: Section 101(b) applies only to ""scarce and critical material essential to the national defense."" While Trump reportedly relies on steak, cheeseburgers and meatloaf for his own sustenance, our service members, law enforcement officers and front-line health workers could defend the nation just fine on dairy, eggs and protein-rich legumes.
But even so, the declaration does not — on its own — compel any action.
The second thing the executive order does is to delegate the president's Defense Production Act authority over the food supply chain to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. The order instructs Perdue, a former veterinarian and Georgia governor, to take all appropriate actions ""to ensure America's meat and poultry processors continue operations"" consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In other words, all the powers that previously belonged to Trump under the Defense Production Act with respect to the food supply chain now belong to Perdue.
What exactly are those powers? First, the Defense Production Act allows the president — and now, by virtue of Tuesday's order, Perdue — to require meat and poultry plants to prioritize certain contracts over others. For example, if a beef plant cannot satisfy all of its demand, then Perdue can mandate that the plant provide beef to the Army before it ships its product to a supermarket chain.
Second, and somewhat more vaguely, the Defense Production Act authorizes the president (and now Perdue) to ""allocate materials, services, and facilities in such manner, upon such conditions, and to such extent as he shall deem necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense."" Could Perdue invoke that authority to order a plant to reopen? Possibly, though he hasn't done so yet. Such an order would not shield the plant from liability for potential COVID-19 exposures, however, and it would not require workers to show up to the plant. Moreover, a plant upset with an order from Perdue potentially could challenge it in federal court, where the agriculture secretary's action — like other agency actions — would be reviewed for reasonableness.
All this, though, is somewhat premature, given that Perdue has not yet issued any order to any meat or poultry producer or processor. Notwithstanding headlines like CNN's ""Trump orders meat processing plants to stay open,"" neither Trump nor his agriculture secretary has issued any such mandate. If a plant is closed, it can remain closed. If managers want to close an additional plant, they can. Nothing has changed any of that as a legal matter.
The danger, though, is that workers and managers in the meat and poultry industry will respond not to the law but to the way that the law is portrayed. It is quite a lot to ask any nonlawyer to parse the text of Trump's executive order and the statutes on which the order is based. And certainly when union leaders, progressive politicians and respected media outlets affirm the president's delusions, we cannot blame ordinary folks for assuming that shuttered plants now must spring back into action.
As important as this issue is for thousands of workers in the meat and poultry industry, it may be only a small preview of what is soon to come. Trump has intermittently asserted that he has authority to order businesses to reopen even while states and municipalities maintain bans on nonessential services. And he may do so again. The assertion is widely understood by legal scholars to be baseless. Ultimately, though, what matters is not how legal scholars react, but how the public does. If millions of Americans go back to work because Trump told them to and they thought they had to obey, then his baseless claims become true.
In the end, what protects us from an imperial presidency is not just the legal process, which can take weeks or months to kick into gear, but the process by which presidential pronouncements are translated into popular understandings. And what is so worrisome about the meat plant episode is that the translation went badly awry. If the result of the telephone game is to give the president powers he doesn't actually have, then it will not be Trump alone who bears the blame."
"May 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/with-a-lot-of-money-and-limited-time-state-and-local-governments-scramble-to-capture-and-spend-emergency-federal-funds/570176252/,StarTribune,"With a lot of money and limited time, state and local governments scramble to capture and spend emergency federal funds","An unprecedented $2.2 billion in emergency federal aid is flowing to Minnesota, launching a skirmish among local government officials who want to grab the funds to cover their first responder and public health costs soaring from COVID-19.
An-end-of-year deadline set by Congress to spend all the money — and unclear guidance on how to divide it up — is setting up clashes not just between parties but among state, county and city leaders scrambling to meet the ballooning costs of the pandemic at the same time that their tax revenues are plunging.
At the State Capitol, the federal funding already has set up a confrontation between Gov. Tim Walz’s administration and Republican leaders, who are uneasy about his executive orders shutting down much of the state. They’re pushing for the Legislature to have a say in how the federal funds are used to respond to the crisis.
And while state officials were deciding how to use the federal bounty, leaders in Hennepin and Ramsey counties were meeting last week to start hashing out how they’ll spend their slices of the pie.
“Local government has been on the front lines responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and will be on the front lines of our recovery,” said Ramsey County Board Chairwoman Toni Carter.
Under the CARES Act — short for Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security — signed by President Donald Trump in late March, each state and municipalities with populations of more than 500,000 received aid.
The state received the bulk of the funding coming to Minnesota, $1.87 billion, with Hennepin County getting $212 million and Ramsey County $96 million. But the state’s largest cities, including Minneapolis (population 428,000) and St. Paul (population 313,000), didn’t receive a direct federal allocation. Their leaders now are making a case for a share of the emergency funds.
Minneapolis City Coordinator Mark Ruff said city officials have inquired about a cut of the CARES Act funding that went to the state and Hennepin County.
“We won’t get a firm understanding of how these funds will be distributed until all of the federal stimulus packages are completed,” Ruff said, adding that they should know more in June when the city adjusts its budget to reflect spending on the pandemic.
Walz’s budget commissioner, Myron Frans, said that up to $667 million of the state’s share can go to local governments for pandemic-related expenses. But he said they haven’t gotten much more guidance than that.
“That’s the $667 million question,” he said.
Frans said the Walz administration plans to work with the Legislature on how and when that money will be distributed, knowing they’re on a deadline. Money that isn’t used by the end of the year goes back to the federal government.
Frans said he’s watching how other states handle the funding. Maryland, for example, sent half of its local government funding to cities on a per capita basis. Missouri sent all the money to local governments based on population.
“What’s a fair way to do this?” he said. “Look at these hot spots we have in Worthington or other places. If you just distribute it on a per capita basis, they’re not going to get the money they need in Worthington to really address that issue.”
The largest portion of the state’s relief funding from the federal government — roughly $1 billion — has other strings attached to it. The state already has moved $228 million to the Department of Human Services to fund congregate and home-delivered meals and to the Health Department for emergency inspection and rural hospital programs. The money also has been used for grants to airports and rural transit.
A $226 million grant is going directly to the Metropolitan Council, along with $93 million for the Minnesota State System and $35 million to the University of Minnesota. Grants of $160 million for child nutrition and $140 million for elementary and secondary education are in the hopper.
‘A tall order’
St. Paul city leaders, frustrated over being left out by Congress, are hoping to leverage partnerships with the state and Ramsey County to receive some of the federal aid.
Deputy Mayor Jaime Tincher said they’ve already spent $3 million on such things as overtime and personal protective equipment for first responders. The city also has created a $3.2 million bridge fund that has been tapped for grants to needy families and struggling businesses.
“The biggest challenge ... is a lack of federal assistance to cities under 500,000 population,” Tincher said. “Cities under 500,000 have the same responsibility to their community as cities over 500,000 do.”
Daniel Lightfoot, a lobbyist for the League of Minnesota Cities, said the pandemic is pressuring cities because of spiking health and public safety costs and because of revenue drops. CARES funding can be used to reimburse COVID-related costs, such as public safety overtime costs and computer equipment for employees working at home, but not to plug budget holes left by lost revenue.
Cities are losing taxes as businesses shut down, and they expect more losses from property tax delinquencies and nonpayments. Licensing and permit fee revenue are down along with user fee payments for shuttered parks, pools and recreation centers.
“We fully anticipate the unbudgeted costs related to this pandemic are only going to go up,” Lightfoot said. “And the loss of revenue is going to be substantial.”
With all of Minnesota’s 853 incorporated cities left out of CARES funding, Lightfoot said cities are fighting for direct aid in the next package from Congress. Meanwhile, they’re working with the state to get some of the current payout.
County leaders say that federal aid going to cities should come from the state’s much larger share, not theirs.
“St. Paul is the state’s second-largest city, with more than half of Ramsey County’s population, and should be eligible for direct support from the state’s $1.8 billion CARES allocation,” Carter, the board chairwoman, said.
The unanswered question is how the amount of aid to cities would be determined. Payment could be based on population, Lightfoot said. Expense reimbursements is another possibility. One option the league likes is using the money to support workers’ compensation funds.
There’s also time pressure. Cities need cash now.
“It’s a tall order; it’s quite the challenge,” Lightfoot said. “You have the short-term costs and then you have what happens over the next two months.”
‘Short window’
At the county level, Hennepin staffers estimate that the cost of sheltering and feeding the homeless, including moving some from shelters to hotels, could climb as high as $60 million. The county last week allocated $2 million for a package of $7,500 grants to go to 265 small businesses.
Now commissioners are talking about spending millions more to help renters, senior-home residents and workers, and additional small businesses.
“I have a lot of citizens who are literally losing their life’s dream right now,” said Commissioner Jeff Johnson, a frequent opponent of increased county spending.
Commissioner Mike Opat expressed frustration at the number of seniors living in community settings who are now dying of COVID-19. “We’re six weeks into this and there’s no appreciable action that I can see” to curb the crush of COVID-19 deaths at long-term care facilities, he said.
Ramsey County officials are drafting strategies to deploy the aid in three areas: job seekers, individuals and families, and small businesses struggling to survive.
The county has already spent or signed contracts for $8.1 million on COVID responses, increasing capacity and shelter options for the homeless and purchasing personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves for first responders.
“We want to get the money out very quickly to the community and to those most in need,” said Ramsey County Finance Director Alexandra Kotze. “But we do need more clarity from the state and the federal government about how to spend those funds.”
And with a hard deadline of eight months, it has to happen soon. “It’s a short window,” Kotze said."

(Just in case!) Will the government be ready?,"Six months before the next presidential election, President Donald Trump has begun some formal planning, but it remains unclear whether the administration will be fully prepared to shepherd our government into a second Trump term or to transfer power to his successor. The coronavirus pandemic makes it even more important that our government adequately plan for the future: The United States now has the most cases and casualties from COVID-19 in the world, and the virus understandably must be our government’s top priority. Unfortunately, Trump’s repeated attempts to subvert and corrupt the institutions that will be critical to an effective transition loom as a potential new problem later this year.
Presidential transition is an enormous undertaking, led by mostly unknown agencies. For example, in May 2016, President Barack Obama established a White House Transition Coordinating Council and an Agency Transition Directors Council that included leadership from the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). President George W. Bush took similar steps in 2008. Experts agree that facilitating a smooth transition is critical to governance even if a president is reelected.
First-term presidents sometimes took a different approach to transition. Now, pursuant to the Presidential Transition Act of 2015, Trump must start building his transition council, becoming the first president to seek re-election “while taking detailed steps to prepare for the prospect of defeat.” Last week, GSA’s major activities timeline for the presidential transition was updated for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak, identifying multiple deadlines this month. While the Trump administration is working to meet these benchmarks, the president’s relentless attacks against institutions leading the transition effort threaten this fundamental part of our democratic process.
Trump’s hostility to checks and balances has defined his presidency. His earliest attacks on democratic norms came against OGE, the agency that works “in partnership with” presidential transition teams to ensure “that prospective nominees are free of conflicts of interest, to fill top leadership positions quickly.” In January 2017, then President-elect Trump ignored OGE’s advice to divest from his business while serving in office, leading to thousands of conflicts of interest. Then in March 2017, the White House rebuffed OGE’s recommendation to discipline counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway for violating ethics rules by promoting Ivanka Trump’s business while on the job. In July 2017, then-OGE Director Walter Shaub resigned in protest, prompting one publication to declare that Trump “broke” OGE. (Shaub is now my colleague at the nonpartisan ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.)
The Trump administration has repeatedly undermined NARA, an agency with “special responsibilities” during transitions that ensures that government records are properly preserved. Following reports that White House aides used encrypted apps that destroy messages to discuss government business, NARA raised concerns that the administration was not appropriately preserving presidential records. This year, presidential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner led a “shadow” coronavirus task force that uses nonpublic e-mail accounts in violation of federal law. Unfortunately, NARA lacks legal authority to force the White House to comply with the Presidential Records Act, leading to even more abuses.
As the agency responsible for federal human capital management, OPM is central to the transition process for an incumbent or a president-elect. Unfortunately, the last two Trump appointees to lead OPM abruptly left the job after clashing with the White House. Trump’s first nominee for OPM director withdrew amid ethics concerns. Despite this disarray, Trump appointed acting OPM director Michael Rigas to a second position, at the Office of Management and Budget, with responsibility for running the Agency Transition Directors Council. Trump has also left OPM without a permanent inspector general for more than three years.
Even more concerning is Trump’s assault on ethics at GSA, which plays a critical role in the transition by helping a president “assume their official duties.” In 2018, public reports confirmed findings by GSA’s inspector general that Trump was coordinating efforts with the agency to stop the FBI’s long-planned move from downtown Washington; the move could have created more competition for Trump’s hotel if other hoteliers built on the FBI site. Earlier this month, the Trump Organization asked GSA to reduce its hotel rent because of the pandemic, raising more alarms that the president’s family may receive special favors from the government.
Under federal law, the Justice Department is required to facilitate presidential transitions by providing “pre-election security clearances for key transition staff in both campaigns,” among other tasks. Yet Attorney General William P. Barr has continually enabled the department to become a partisan tool for the president’s personal agenda. In February, Barr overruled career prosecutors’ sentencing recommendation for Trump ally Roger Stone after pressure from the president. Later, Barr defended Trump’s removal of the inspector general who forwarded the Ukraine whistleblower complaint to Congress. Trump’s and Barr’s repeated attempts to undermine the Justice Department’s independence are cause for grave concern about its outsize role in the transition process.
The president has aggressively weakened or co-opted the agencies most important to the transition. This will make it harder to address the natural turnover expected among senior appointees if Trump wins re-election. An incoming administration’s preparations could likewise suffer if Trump and his political appointees don’t meet transition benchmarks on time. In April, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden began assembling a transition team. Government ethics groups have called on Biden to publicly announce the leaders of his transition team, outline its governance policies and appoint an “ethics czar” by June. Ensuring that ethics and transparency are ingrained in both the campaigns’ and the administration’s transition teams is critical to having a functioning and accountable government on Jan. 20, 2021.
Nearly four years ago, Trump led a notoriously chaotic transition, making it difficult for many of his nominees to address conflicts of interest and win Senate confirmation. Now, congressional oversight committees should investigate how the coronavirus pandemic may affect the 2020 transition. Inspectors general should proactively review whether their agencies are complying with presidential transition statutes, including the requirement that career government officials, rather than political appointees, oversee agency transition plans. If Trump doesn’t adequately prepare for this next transition, the resulting instability will undermine the efficacy of the Trump or Biden administration at a time when the nation is especially vulnerable. Without ethical, transparent and effective leadership, presidential transition will become another pillar of our democracy to crumble under the Trump administration."
"May 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-s-often-been-wrong-on-covid-19-but-he-s-not-alone/570221432/,StarTribune,"Trump's often been wrong on COVID-19, but he's not alone","No American elected official has said as many dangerously irresponsible things about the coronavirus as President Donald Trump. But we would be remiss if we let local officials, including those who have led well since, off the hook for their own early downplaying of COVID-19.
We say this not to wag a freshly washed finger; the pandemic has been a painfully humbling learning experience for this Editorial Board, too. We say it to establish how widespread and potentially costly was the early underestimation of the pain and death COVID-19 might cause in New York City.
On Feb. 26, before the virus strained the city’s hospital system nearly to the breaking point, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said, “We’ve got a long time to ramp up if we ever had anything like that [kind of crisis]. So, the capacity we have right now is outstanding given the challenge we’re facing right now.” That turned out not to be true.
On March 2, when New York state registered its first official coronavirus case, de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo had a rare joint news conference to reassure New Yorkers. Cuomo said, “We should relax, because that’s what’s dictated by the reality of the situation.”
He added: “Excuse our arrogance as New Yorkers — I speak for the mayor also on this one — we think we have the best health care system on the planet right here in New York. So, when you’re saying, what happened in other countries vs. what happened here, we don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries.”
On March 3, de Blasio said, “Occasional contact, glancing contact, temporary contact does not, from everything we know about coronavirus, lead to transmission.” Untrue.
On March 8, de Blasio said, “Certainly, on most surfaces like metal, plastic — you know, a desk, a kitchen counter, a subway pole, it’s only a matter of minutes before the disease dies, the virus dies in the open air.”
On March 9, he said, “It’s not people in the stadium, it’s not people in the big open area or a conference and all” who need to worry about infection. Wrong.
As late as March 11, when the country was coalescing around the need for social distancing, de Blasio said, “If you’re not sick, then you should be going about your life.”
On March 15, both Cuomo and de Blasio were defending the decision to keep schools open, as were we — before a weekend when both changed their minds.
As late as early April, de Blasio claimed that it was “only in the last really 48 hours or so do they feel they’ve seen evidence around the world ... that this disease can be spread by asymptomatic people.” In fact, that realization had set in weeks before."
"May 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/study-mutant-virus-has-emerged-even-more-contagious-than-original/570207071/,StarTribune,"Study: Mutant coronavirus has emerged, even more contagious than original","Scientists have identified a new strain of the coronavirus that has become dominant worldwide and appears to be more contagious than the versions that spread in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new study led by scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
The new strain appeared in February in Europe, migrated quickly to the East Coast of the United States and has been the dominant strain across the world since mid-March, the scientists wrote.
In addition to spreading faster, it may make people vulnerable to a second infection after a first bout with the disease, the report warned.
The 33-page report was posted Thursday on BioRxiv, a website that researchers use to share their work before it is peer reviewed, an effort to speed up collaborations with scientists working on COVID-19 vaccines or treatments.
That research has been largely based on the genetic sequence of earlier strains and might not be effective against the new one. The mutation identified in the new report affects the now infamous spikes on the exterior of the coronavirus, which allow it to enter human respiratory cells.
The report's authors said they felt an ""urgent need for an early warning"" so that vaccines and drugs under development around the world will be effective against the mutated strain. Wherever the new strain appeared, it quickly infected far more people than the earlier strains that came out of Wuhan, China, and within weeks it was the only strain that was prevalent in some nations, according to the report.
The new strain's dominance over its predecessors demonstrates that it is more infectious, according to the report, though exactly why is not yet known.
The coronavirus, known to scientists as SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 3.5 million people around the world and caused more than 250,000 COVID-19 deaths since its discovery late last year. The report was based on a computational analysis of more than 6,000 coronavirus sequences from around the world, collected by the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data, a public-private organization in Germany.
Time and again, the analysis found the new version was transitioning to become dominant. The Los Alamos team, assisted by scientists at Duke University and the University of Sheffield in England, identified 14 mutations. Those mutations occurred among the nearly 30,000 base pairs of RNA that other scientists say make up the coronavirus's genome.
The report authors focused on a mutation called D614G, which is responsible for the change in the virus' spikes.
""The story is worrying, as we see a mutated form of the virus very rapidly emerging, and over the month of March becoming the dominant pandemic form,"" study leader Bette Korber, a computational biologist at Los Alamos, wrote on her Facebook page. ""When viruses with this mutation enter a population, they rapidly begin to take over the local epidemic, thus they are more transmissible.""
While the Los Alamos report is highly technical and dispassionate, Korber expressed some deep personal feelings about the implications of the finding in her Facebook post. ""This is hard news,"" wrote Korber, ""but please don't only be disheartened by it. Our team at LANL was able to document this mutation and its impact on transmission only because of a massive global effort of clinical people and experimental groups, who make new sequences of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) in their local communities available as quickly as they possibly can.""

The report contains regional breakdowns of when the new strain of virus first emerged and how long it took to become dominant. Italy was one of the first countries to see the new virus in the last week of February, almost at the same time that the original strain appeared.
Washington was among the first states to get hit with the original strain in late February, but by March 15 the mutated strain dominated. New York was hit by the original virus around March 15, but within days the mutant strain took over. The team did not report results for California.
Scientists at major organizations working on a vaccine or drugs have told The Times that they are pinning their hopes on initial evidence that the virus is stable and not likely to mutate the way influenza virus does, requiring a new vaccine every year. The Los Alamos report could upend that assumption.
If the pandemic fails to wane seasonally as the weather warms, the study warns, the virus could undergo further mutations even as research organizations prepare the first medical treatments and vaccines. Without getting on top of the risk now, the effectiveness of vaccines could be limited.
Some of the compounds in development are supposed to latch onto the spike or interrupt its action. If they were designed based on the original version of the spike, they might not be effective against the new coronavirus strain, the study's authors warned."
"May 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/if-you-think-you-have-had-covid-19-can-you-be-tested-to-prove-it/570174311/,StarTribune,"If you think you have had COVID-19, can you be tested to prove it?","If you suspect you may have already had COVID-19, is there a test that can be done after the illness has passed?
Yes, there is a blood test that looks for signs that someone had been infected by COVID-19. Also known as a serology test, it is not used to diagnose someone with the disease — that is done by taking nasal or oral samples using cotton swabs for a different type of test. Instead, the serology test looks for antibodies, which are proteins in the blood that are produced as part of the body’s immune response to infection. These are usually most detectable after someone has recovered from the illness.
The hope is that antibody testing will provide new options for people and public health policymakers. If we can identify those who have COVID-19 immunity, perhaps more people can safely be deployed on the front lines, such as health care, grocery stores, transit drivers, child care and other critical jobs. It would also be valuable information for family caregivers, co-workers and for anyone trying to get back to a normal life.
For public health officials, the antibody testing can be used to help provide estimates on what share of the population could be immune from the new coronavirus. That would inform decisions about when and how to lift stay at home and other restrictions.
Health officials and doctors, however, caution that at this point the antibody tests results do not come with ironclad certainty. That’s because we still don’t know everything about COVID-19 immunity. And, unfortunately, some tests are not as good as others and some could even be fraudulent, marketed by those who exploit the fear caused by the pandemic.
“We have a lot to learn in terms of how long an immunity to this virus lasts,” said Matthew Binnicker, director of the clinical virology lab at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.
“What we don’t know yet is how long the antibodies persist and whether they provide strong immunity against the virus.”
Exposure to some viruses provides long-term immunity.
“For some diseases like measles, protection is lifelong. For other diseases, protection is limited,” said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director at the Minnesota Department of Health.
Ehresmann and others are part of a public-private work group that is working on guidelines on how to deploy and use serology tests. Both Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota have developed their own antibody tests. As of now, the tests are not widely available.
Public demand is expected to exceed capacity, in part because 80% of COVID-19 infections cause only mild symptoms — leaving many people in limbo wondering whether they were infected.
Private companies are also rolling out antibody tests, but not all of them are approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
“While we have some real high quality tests being developed in the state,” said Daniel Huff, assistant commissioner for health protection at the Health Department. “Not all of these serology tests are the same.”
Some tests detect the presence of antibodies to coronavirus, but lack the precision to detect the particular coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Different types of coronaviruses caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the MERS 2012 outbreak, but they also are responsible for the common cold.
“Some of the lower quality tests will actually show that you had one of these common cold type coronaviruses,” Huff said. “There are a lot of, unfortunately, fraudulent tests out there.”"
"May 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/biden-should-step-aside-we-can-t-sacrifice-another-woman-for-political-gain/570241332/,StarTribune,Biden should step aside. We can't sacrifice another woman for political gain.,"It’s a story we know all too well. A woman says a politician hurt her. He abused her. She’s coming forward now. She wants people to know what this man is made of, what he’s capable of.
And we know the rest of the story, too. People question her motives. People question her character. She is part of a partisan conspiracy to discredit the person she’s accusing. Or maybe she’s just wrong. Maybe it wasn’t that bad. It can’t be that bad.
It’s the story cycle we use to wash, rinse and then ultimately pronounce as clean our male politicians — how we justify placing them in positions of power.
It happened with President Bill Clinton after the allegations of sexual misconduct from Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Leslie Millwee and Monica Lewinsky. (In light of the MeToo movement, Lewinsky has come to describe her relationship with Clinton as a “gross abuse of power.”)
It has happened with President Donald Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women. In a recent, vivid example, it happened in fall 2018, when Christine Blasey Ford accused then-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her at a high school gathering. Ford is still effectively in hiding after her moving testimony, while Kavanaugh sits on the high court.
And now we have the case of Tara Reade, who has accused former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, of assaulting her when she worked in his Senate office in 1993. Reade’s brother and a friend who prefers to remain anonymous have both said she recounted the incident to them at the time. Biden, echoing the men before him, has flatly declared, “It never happened.”
Many Democrats are twisting themselves into rhetorical pretzels to justify ignoring Reade’s allegations. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, says that because the allegation didn’t turn up when Biden was vetted as the Democrats’ vice presidential selection in 2008, it couldn’t have happened. In the New York Times, columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote, “Reade seems almost engineered in a lab to inspire skepticism in mainstream Democrats, both because her story keeps changing and because of her bizarre public worship of President Vladimir Putin of Russia.” (Reade wrote, and has since deleted, an article on the website Medium praising Putin’s leadership.)
Biden’s communications staff has stressed that the man who “authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act” could not have committed such an act — in much the same way Kavanaugh’s defenders said his history of hiring female clerks made Blasey Ford’s accusation unthinkable.
I wish it all didn’t feel so familiar.
When Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, it felt for a moment as if the story arc might change — that this time, the story would end differently. She was a compelling witness — recalling, for example, the laughter of the men, boys really, assaulting her: “indelible,” she said, in her “hippocampus,” the part of the brain where short-term recall transforms into long-term memories.
I watched her testimony on my computer, sitting in my bedroom, crying — remembering my own assault in college, 17 years ago, which I’d never spoken of or told anyone about. Because to function I had to convince myself that it had never happened. Near me on the bed, my phone buzzed and buzzed with text messages from friends, each of whom had their own stories, too, their own moments that they had convinced themselves had never happened. Because the daily enterprise of womanhood, of survival, required that we gaslight ourselves.
As we now know, the story did not end differently. The Republicans needed Kavanaugh more than they needed the truth, and Republicans on the committee insisted on a truncated investigation of the accusations. They wanted his vote on the Supreme Court, and political expediency won the day.
Right now, the Democrats are faced with the same choice. Our presumptive nominee stands credibly accused of sexual misconduct. It’s a nightmare in an election cycle that has already seen the impeachment of the sitting president and a global pandemic that Trump is utterly unequipped to handle. Lives hang in the balance of the outcome in November.
And yet Democrats should still insist that Biden step aside. Democrats must apply the standards we elaborated during the Kavanaugh case to our own side. In his defense, Biden’s campaign is emphasizing his support of women’s rights. But as Jessica Valenti argues in GEN, “Feminists must not fall into the trap of ignoring individual women’s stories in exchange for broader political power. It not only runs counter to our most fundamental values around trusting women, but it’s also a strategy that has never — and will never — result in the progress we’re actually after.”
And it’s not just feminists, but Democrats. If we want the change we say we do, if we truly stand for women, we cannot silence yet another woman’s voice for political gain. “Biden or Trump” is a false dichotomy designed to force us into hypocrisy. It’s false because it ignores that there are so many qualified candidates who could just as effectively win against Trump in the general election.
Faced with credible accusations of sexual assault against their man, the Republicans could have substituted another judicial conservative for Kavanaugh. Democrats, too, can replace Biden with an ideologically similar figure. Or we risk becoming hypocrites.
It is only May. Biden, were he denied the nomination at or before the August convention, would hardly face jail time, so there’s no need to apply a standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” to Reade’s assertions. Many Democrats and political leaders have called for an independent investigation of Reade’s claims. I, too, echo this call, but it’s not enough. Anyone who has been assaulted knows that there is never a credible enough witness, never enough proof. Biden should be investigated and replaced.
Before Reade went public with her allegations, I had been committed to voting for the Democratic nominee, even if that person wasn’t my preferred candidate. And I intended to vote for Biden despite having had an unpleasant experience with him on the campaign trail. In September 2019, in my role as a columnist for the Cedar Rapids Gazette, I moderated a forum on LGBTQ issues with several presidential candidates. At the forum, I asked Biden about his history of voting for the military policy known as “Don’t ask, don’t tell,” and he replied, sarcastically, “Well, aren’t you nice?”
I replied, “Just asking what people want to know.” The audience applauded. Later, as we walked off the stage, he walked by me and said, dryly, “Well, aren’t you a real sweetheart.”
I tweeted the exchange and it went viral. I spent that weekend hiding in my house from the harassment and death threats — people accusing me of making it up, of misunderstanding him, of attacking him. He never apologized. I bring this up not just for transparency, but because I know, in a very small way, what it’s like to be part of an inconvenient political narrative.
I caucused for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in Iowa’s first-in-the-nation primary contest. But as the primary cycle dragged on, and both low-polling and formidable candidates dropped out, we were finally left with Biden. The Democratic electorate was apparently so afraid of losing another election to Trump that they settled on the safest option: the centrist white male politician. And now, he is yet another white male politician shadowed by sexual misconduct allegations.
I do not want to be forced to balance the accusations against Biden and Trump — playing the “Which is worse?” game. But that is what I’m being told I will have to do.
November is six months away, and we still have time to tell a different story. I want to believe that at least in some small way the world has changed — that all the work the Third Wave of feminism has done to elect more women, and to remove the culture of shame and silence around assault, has shifted how we handle accusations like Reade’s.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., could revive his campaign; other candidates could leap back in; party leaders might recruit a Democratic governor who has handled the coronavirus pandemic well. There are many options. We do not have to sacrifice yet another woman on the altar of political expediency."
"May 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/new-minnesota-budget-projection-2-4-billion-deficit/570208962/,StarTribune,New Minnesota budget projection: $2.4 billion deficit,"The state’s budget outlook crumbled from a $1.5 billion surplus to a projected $2.4 billion deficit in just two months, as the COVID-19 pandemic eats up tax revenue and Minnesota leaders accelerate spending to respond.
Tuesday’s budget projection is the first estimate of just how deep a financial hole Minnesota could face. Budget officials predicted state revenue would be $3.6 billion less than anticipated and spending would be $391 million higher, including additional money the Legislature approved since February.
“The shock to the U.S. economy from the pandemic is unprecedented in modern postwar history, and the economic outlook is exceptionally uncertain and volatile,” said state economist Laura Kalambokidis.
Budget officials typically give projections only in February and November, but the fast-spreading coronavirus prompted an unusual update. The latest numbers will guide lawmakers’ decisions in the final couple of weeks of this legislative session, which is scheduled to end May 18 — and during a special session that Gov. Tim Walz said likely will follow.
The projection also allows Minnesota to draw money from the state’s budget reserves.
It follows a string of strong budget forecasts and one of the longest periods of continuous economic growth in the nation’s history. During the Great Recession, Minnesota experienced worse deficit projections. When former Gov. Mark Dayton took office in 2011, he had to contend with a looming $6.2 billion deficit.
Since then, Minnesota has built its budget reserves, amassing nearly $2.4 billion in a rainy-day fund and an additional $350 million in a cash flow account that can be used to offset revenue shortages.
“Today is a rainy day, unfortunately,” Management and Budget Commissioner Myron Frans said Tuesday. He cautioned against relying solely on the reserves to close the gap, given the likelihood of continued declines in revenue and uncertainty about the economic toll of the coronavirus.
The numbers presented Tuesday are based on predictions from Minnesota’s economic consultant, IHS Markit — which in February forecast 2.1% GDP growth for 2020. The consultant is now predicting a 5.4% decline this year.
The spread of COVID-19 is expected to peak and dissipate in the second quarter of this year, and restrictions like the stay-at-home order will be lifted in the third quarter, IHS predicted. The company expects economic growth late this year and expects the U.S. economy to return to full employment in 2024.
But the Minnesota Council of Economic Advisers, which includes academics, industry experts and a former state economist, warned that could be overly optimistic.
If there’s a resurgence of the virus later this year — as the nation’s leading infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci predicted — that could slow the recovery, the advisers warned. They also said social distancing could lead to small business closures and hurt employment growth, and the stock market’s rebound could be more sluggish than IHS projected.
While it’s impossible to predict exactly how the coronavirus will play out and what the ultimate financial toll will be, the Walz administration and legislators offered options to respond to the economic picture presented Tuesday.
“In a time of deep crisis, deficit spending at the federal level is absolutely necessary,” Walz said, and he talked with Minnesota’s congressional delegation Tuesday morning about the need for more federal aid for state and local governments.
Minnesota, unlike the federal government, must balance its budget.
State leaders could make up the potential shortfall by using reserves, cutting spending, increasing taxes or securing additional federal funding. Minnesota already received about $2 billion from the federal government during the pandemic, but that money is limited to COVID-19-related expenses. It cannot be used to plug a budget hole.
It quickly became clear the deficit projection would provoke new battles at the Capitol, where Republicans have been facing off with Walz and DFL legislators over which businesses should be allowed to reopen during the pandemic.
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said the state should respond to the deficit by renegotiating state employee contracts, rejecting increased spending that won’t be reimbursed by the federal government, bonding carefully and reopening businesses.
“Most importantly, we need to open the economy to revenues that fund essential government services,” Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said in a statement.
House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, called on Walz to make budget cuts like the governors of Wisconsin and New York have done. They reduced spending by $70 million and $10 billion, respectively.
“Families and businesses cannot bear the burden of this crisis alone: government must share in the sacrifice,” he said in a statement.
Walz said he plans to “put every scenario on the table” to fill the budget gap, including potential layoffs and furloughs of state workers. But Walz added that workers account for only about 7% of the state’s budget. He has already instituted a hiring freeze on executive branch jobs.
DFL House Speaker Melissa Hortman, meanwhile, said she is relieved the projected deficit isn’t larger. Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said in a statement that federal aid and reserves allow the state to do some additional spending.
“Investments are needed to make Minnesotans secure in their housing, help small businesses, facilitate distance learning and telemedicine,” she said. “And to ensure we have the workforce we need to provide care for the elderly and people with disabilities.”"
"May 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-democrats-push-covid-19-housing-economic-assistance-package/570288482/,StarTribune,"Minnesota Democrats push COVID-19 housing, economic relief package","Minnesota Democrats in the House are pushing for a $208 million housing and economic assistance package, teeing up end-of-session negotiations with Senate Republicans over whether targeted aid or tax relief is the best way to help Minnesotans struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.
The DFL proposal passed the House 75-58 Thursday on a largely party-line vote. It would pump $100 million into rent, mortgage, utility-bill and property-tax assistance. Another $55 million would fund grants for small and minority-owned businesses. It also includes $27 million in broadband access to expand telemedicine and help families in rural areas with distance learning, as well as $26 million to help compensate personal care assistants helping vulnerable people during the pandemic.
“Minnesota can’t afford not to act,” said House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley. “If we do nothing, if we let them fall through the cracks and be left behind, we are going to have a much, much slower economic recovery afterward.”
The DFL proposal comes on the heels of an updated $2.4 billion projected budget deficit that has dramatically scaled back expectations from legislators this session.
House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said the relief package is paid for through the state’s budget, but she said some pieces could be covered under the $1.87 billion in federal funds the state has received to cover coronavirus-related costs.
It differs from a relief package supported by Senate Republicans, who want to delay tax payments, waive penalties and expand tax credits for families with school-age children.
Both proposals are in the mix as lawmakers rush toward a May 18 deadline to adjourn the regular legislative session. Legislators are also trying to strike a deal on a package of construction projects in a bonding bill, a bill to pay hourly school workers while classrooms are closed to the public and establish oversight over how the state spends federal coronavirus funding.
Legislators want to wrap up work on all of those proposals by the end of the regular session, but many are expecting to be back again in June, when Gov. Tim Walz could need to extend his emergency powers to respond to the pandemic.
GOP efforts to amend the economic relief package on Thursday were aimed less at the bill and more at Walz’s executive powers, which have allowed him to issue stay-home orders and temporarily shut down bars, restaurants and other public spaces to limit the spread of the virus.
One amendment, from Rep. Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, would have suspended the governor’s salary during the peacetime emergency while hundreds of thousands of people are out of work. Another amendment would have required legislative approval if Walz wants to extend a state of peacetime emergency beyond 30 days. Under existing law, Walz can extend the emergency without legislative approval while lawmakers are in session.
“No governor should carry the weight of a global pandemic exclusively upon their own shoulders,” said Rep. Jerry Hertaus, R-Greenfield, the author of the amendment.
Both amendments failed in the DFL-led House."
"May 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/keep-focus-on-the-coronavirus-not-on-china/570289522/,StarTribune,"Keep focus on the coronavirus, not on China","Beyond the most profound health impacts worldwide — including in Minnesota, which on Thursday reported its 508th COVID-19 fatality — the coronavirus pandemic has infected economics and geopolitics to crisis levels, too.
It's imperative to mitigate the damage while the world waits for a vaccine that can end this scourge. But that will be more difficult, and thus deadly, if China and America devolve deeper toward a U.S.-U.S.S.R.-style Cold War.
""This is the most perilous moment since World War II,"" Ryan Hass, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's China Center, told an editorial writer. ""This is the most acute public-health crisis that the world has faced in a century. It's hitting every major country simultaneously. The ability of world powers to collaborate is severely diminished; multilateral institutions like the World Health Organization, the U.N., the G-7, the G-20 just aren't functional.""
The injuries these institutions have endured is due in part to hostility from Washington, where President Donald Trump has undermined confidence and cooperation in postwar entities meant to guide and galvanize the world through a crisis. If these multinational organizations cannot curb the virus, efforts must be led by Beijing and Washington. But at the moment, Hass notes, ""the U.S.-China relationship is in free fall and there doesn't appear to be any effort in Beijing and Washington to preserve its capacity to collaborate in arresting the spread of the virus or destruction that it is causing.""
Instead, Hass continued, ""those countries are trying to place the other in the worst possible light on the international stage.""
The motivation is domestic politics for President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi may not face a November election but is suddenly vulnerable despite previous veneration of his leadership that made him China's most powerful leader since Mao.
Trump, as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have alleged — without evidence — that the virus emerged from a lab in Wuhan and not naturally through animal-to-human transmission, as most experts believe. There's also talk among some supporters of the administration about pressing for reparations, or even not paying some of the debt the U.S. owes China.
These moves have alienated allies — including those who rightfully take umbrage at Beijing's manipulative extraction of praise in exchange for desperately needed equipment. Instead, the president should be rallying allies, and indeed the world, in a coordinated coronavirus effort as well as in a longer-term response to a rising China.
For China, ""trying to impose its narrative of the coronavirus both internationally but more importantly domestically is important for the leadership to rehabilitate and consolidate its position and legitimacy in the system,"" Hung Tran, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told an editorial writer. He added that it may also embolden China to take a more dangerous stance toward Taiwan, Hong Kong and its maritime claims in the South China Sea.
Xi's geopolitical push is also about ""trying to generate more widespread support among Chinese for how quickly and efficiently and presumably effectively the Chinese have come out of this while the rest of the world, especially America, can't seem to control the virus,"" Evan Medeiros, the chair of Asian Studies at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, told an editorial writer. As for Trump, Medeiros said, ""this is largely for him a recognition that blaming China deflects responsibility from the cascade of shortcomings within the United States.""
China clearly deserves some blame. Wuhan was the epicenter, regardless of how the virus originated, and the Chinese Communist Party suppressed the information that could have helped contain COVID-19 to a regional outbreak, not a global pandemic that's breaking the world's economy, and order.
On a longer-term basis, Beijing has a horrific human rights record toward Tibetans, Uighurs and others. It's also the world's biggest jailer of journalists, it threatens neighboring nations with its territorial aggression, and it makes a practice of illegitimate, if not illegal, trade practices.
These, and other issues like an overreliance on China for essential materials, will need to be strategically assessed by the U.S. and its allies regardless of who wins November's election. But for now the literal life-or-death imperative is the pandemic.
""The only way to make the United States safe is to stamp out the virus in every corner of the world,"" Hass said. ""The only way to stamp out the virus in every corner of the world is to align international efforts to do so, and there's no pathway to doing that without China on board. And so it's time to tone down the rhetoric, take a break from the finger pointing, and roll up our sleeves and figure out how to get our arms around the problem.
""The American people,"" Hass rightfully concluded, ""deserve it."""
"May 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-expiring-covid-19-money-a-looming-problem/570287182/,StarTribune,Minnesota's expiring COVID-19 money a 'looming problem',"Minnesota has $65 million left in its coronavirus response fund and four days to spend it.
The Legislature created the $200 million COVID-19 Minnesota Fund in March and set a May 11 deadline to use up the money. Budget officials are now seeking an extension, and want to add another $200 million or $300 million to continue the pandemic response.
The fund’s expiration date is a “looming problem” and the remaining millions will not all be spent by then, Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Myron Frans warned. That’s not because of a lack of demand for the aid.
It can take several days for spending requests to come together, said Frans, who is seeking the additional money and an extension of the fund until June 30, 2021.
Any dollars left in the pot that have not been approved Monday by a legislative oversight commission will return to Minnesota’s general fund.
A continuation of the COVID-19 assistance fund is possible, but it is a “tight timeline” to get that done by Monday, said House Ways and Means Chairman Lyndon Carlson, DFL-Crystal, who added a bill extending the fund to his committee’s Friday agenda.
“If we didn’t get it done by Monday, there would be a window there where they wouldn’t be able to make any purchases from the fund,” he said.
Carlson said he never supported the “artificial deadline” of May 11. That was part of the deal made with Republicans, he said, as legislators quickly drew up an agreement to create the $200 million fund as the coronavirus started to hit the state in March.
Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington, said the deadline is “like having a 30-day evaluation at a new job.”
“This way the executive branch doesn’t have a blank check,” he said.
The state is getting 10 to 20 times more requests for aid than what they have available, said Garofalo, who is on the commission that oversees the spending. He supports extending the use of the fund and adding money to it. But with the state facing a possible $2.4 billion budget deficit, he said Walz’s administration needs to make it “crystal clear” where the additional dollars would come from.
So far much of the cash has gone to critical care equipment and machines, such as gloves, masks and ventilators. It also has been used for COVID-19 testing contracts with Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota. More than $10 million was recently needed to dispose of dead animals that couldn’t be used for food due to processing plant shutdowns.
Lawmakers said a lapse in the fund could hinder the state’s response to whatever challenge emerges next.
“We want to make sure that they have the ability to spend dollars quickly,” said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park. “We do know that the [personal protective equipment] market is a little bit like the Wild Wild West right now, and that having the ability to move quickly on an opportunity can be the difference between getting the PPE and not getting the PPE.”
The COVID-19 Minnesota Fund is not the only source of cash for emergency demands. While Gov. Tim Walz’s administration could use federal relief money for some needs, Hortman said the state fund allows Minnesota officials to act faster and leverage different sources of money.
The legislative commission that oversees the state fund has just 24 hours to sign off on a proposal to use some of the money, but the approval process to spend federal funding can take up to 10 days. And for certain expenses — like the disposal of animal carcasses — Minnesota might only be able to qualify for reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency if it uses its own state dollars, Hortman said."
"May 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/voting-by-mail-just-do-it/570309232/,StarTribune,Voting by mail: Just do it,"If I were a fan of the coronavirus, here’s what I’d like to see this fall: crowds of Americans standing in line for minutes or hours in venues where they can easily infect each other. By then, the contagion may be receding thanks to measures to combat it, or it may be going strong. Either way, Election Day could be a great boon to the disease, furnishing a trove of new victims.
There is a way to deprive the pandemic of this extraordinary opportunity: getting as many people as possible to cast their votes by mail instead of in person. It’s an entirely doable response. But not everyone thinks saving lives is worth the trouble. One of them is Donald Trump, who voted by mail in Florida’s March primary but doesn’t think everyone else should.
He took great pride in doing an interview Sunday inside the Lincoln Memorial. This is one of those issues, though, on which he does not ask himself: What would Abe do? We have a good idea — because it was during his presidency that absentee voting by mail originated so that soldiers in the Union Army could participate in the 1864 election.
Just as suppressing the slave states’ rebellion was too important to force enlisted men to travel back home to vote, suppressing this virus is too important to force voters to choose between their health and their civic responsibility. And the more people who can be induced to vote by mail, the fewer opportunities there will be for the disease to spread.
We have confirmed the hazards of in-person voting during a pandemic. Illinois went ahead with an election on March 17, days before a statewide stay-at-home order. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he didn’t have the authority to postpone it, but over the following four weeks, the state death toll from COVID-19 rose from 1 to 868.
Wisconsin voters had to troop to the polls on April 7, by which time the danger of doing so had become apparent to everyone. Of those who voted in person or worked at a voting site, 52 tested positive for the virus over the following two weeks.
Five states have also proven the practicality of shifting to voting by mail. Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington send mail-in ballots to every registered voter, eliminating the need to go to the polls. It’s simple, efficient, inexpensive and far more sanitary.
It would cost money in the short run, which is why it makes sense for the federal government to provide aid to state governments. Because of the toll from the pandemic and its economic fallout, they are already short of funds. In the long run, the shift would probably save money.
Most states, including Illinois, already allow any voter to request an absentee ballot, while 16 states require a valid excuse. But more than 90% of Illinois voters don’t bother. Making the process of getting a mail-in ballot automatic would induce many more people to use it.
Even if you prefer voters to exercise the franchise at their local sites — and even if most of them would prefer to — the threat argues for furnishing another option. No one knows how widespread COVID-19 will be come November. A surge in cases, or a deadly mutation of the virus, could make in-person voting even more dangerous.
At worst, sending out ballots provides a workable Plan B in case Plan A proves too hazardous. As the nonpartisan group Reform for Illinois argues, “Sending a ballot is the only way to guarantee that everyone has the option of voting safely on Election Day, even if in-person voting must be restricted for public health reasons.”
In New York, which normally requires an excuse for absentee voting Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order requiring mail ballots to be sent to every registered voter for the June primary.
Trump opposes such a change because voting entirely by mail is “ripe for fraud” and because it “doesn’t work out well for Republicans.” In fact, states with all-mail elections have experienced very little fraud, and an April Reuters/Ipos poll found that 65% of GOP voters favor requiring mail-in ballots for the November election if the pandemic continues.

But few figures have stood out as sharply as this one:
Of all those who have died from the mysterious viral illness statewide, 99.24% had an underlying health condition.
When there’s no proven treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine, it’s tempting to succumb to the potentially false reassurance offered by both this eye-grabbing statistic and the vagueness of the “underlying condition” category. Without further scrutiny, it may seem that only those who are elderly or acutely ill are vulnerable.
The reality: Many of those who lead normal lives despite having common, treatable chronic conditions — high blood pressure is a prominent example — appear to be at higher risk for becoming seriously ill or dying after becoming infected with this new strain of coronavirus. As mitigation measures begin to ease, it’s critically important to understand individual susceptibilities. Your risk, or that of a loved one, may be higher than previously realized.
The state has a useful dashboard of COVID-19 information. But it doesn’t list underlying health conditions for those who have become severely ill or passed away — an information gap that should be filled.
The New York State Department of Health does track some of this information for that hard-hit state. Of the 20,828 fatalities listed on Friday, 89.4% had at least one underlying health condition, also known as a “co-morbidity.” Hypertension (high blood pressure) is by far the most common. Rounding out the top five are diabetes, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), dementia and coronary artery disease.
A recent study published in the medical journal JAMA raised concerns about other common health conditions. The study analyzed the underlying health conditions in 5,700 patients, with a median age of 63, who were hospitalized in the New York City area between March 1 and April 4 with COVID-19. It included patients who survived, a key difference from the state fatalities-only figures.
The most common co-morbidities were hypertension (56.6%), obesity (41.7%) and diabetes (33.8%). Being older and being male were also common characteristics, researchers found, noting the “pattern” here is similar to data reported in China.
Hypertension’s prevalence in both sets of New York data is worth noting. This is a common condition, affecting an estimated 29% of the general population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The percentage climbs steadily with age. The condition is also more prevalent among blacks.
So what is it about hypertension that may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 illness? And is the risk less if the condition is controlled with medication? “The short answer is we don’t know,’’ said Dr. Bradley Benson, the University of Minnesota Medical School’s chief academic officer.
There are several theories involving vascular abnormalities or inflammation. While researchers scrutinize this, Benson is telling patients with hypertension to continue taking their medication and “not to hit the panic button.”
“Most people with hypertension do just fine. But you do need to understand that if you get COVID … you do have a higher risk of a bad outcome. This is real.”
Data-driven tools under development may soon help doctors more precisely calculate individuals’ risk of a poor outcome after contracting COVID-19. Until then, Benson advises that patients with hypertension or other common conditions err on the side of caution, for example by continuing social distancing even as state-ordered precautions phase out.
Just because you can let down your guard against COVID doesn’t mean you should."
"May 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/big-week-for-trump-at-the-supreme-court/570359031/,StarTribune,Big week for Trump at the Supreme Court,"The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear what could become the biggest cases involving Donald Trump as president, a pair of constitutional clashes that could insulate chief executives from investigations while in office and add an explosive new element to the 2020 election campaign.
Trump is trying to keep House Democrats and a New York prosecutor from seeing his financial records. The high court will hear back-to-back arguments Tuesday — by phone and livestreamed because of the coronavirus outbreak — on Trump's efforts to block his banks and accountants from complying with subpoenas they have received.
The court's rulings could determine whether the president's tax returns become public, and whether he faces an accelerated criminal investigation in New York. It will pose one of the toughest tests yet for Chief Justice John Roberts' court, forcing it to navigate politically polarizing and constitutionally weighty issues less than six months before the presidential election.
""I do think they will be searching — I hope they will be searching — for a way to resolve the cases that rises above the partisan division that infects so much else in the United States,"" said David Cole, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is urging the court to reject Trump's challenges.
The clashes summon memories of cases involving two other heavily investigated presidents, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. In 1974 the Supreme Court unanimously forced Nixon to turn over the secret White House tape recordings that led to his resignation. The court was unanimous again in 1997 in ruling that a sexual harassment suit against Clinton could go forward while he was in office.
The subpoenas seek years of Trump's personal financial records, as well as those of the Trump Organization and his other businesses. They are directed to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, and his banks, Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp. The accountants and banks aren't contesting the subpoenas and have said they will comply with their legal obligations.
Though the legal issues are distinct, the two cases share overarching themes. In each, Trump's personal lawyers and his administration's Justice Department say the lower courts that ruled against him were insufficiently sensitive to the intrusive nature of a demand for a sitting president's personal records. In each, Trump's adversaries say the president is effectively trying to put himself above the law.
And in each, Democrats are trying to finally see the tax returns Trump refused to release as a candidate and then as president. Until Trump, every president dating back to Jimmy Carter made his returns public.
The House subpoena case focuses on the power of Congress to demand presidential documents outside of impeachment investigations. Three House committees — Oversight, Financial Services and Intelligence — say they are pursuing legislative goals, including updating ethics laws and trying to guard against foreign influence in the 2020 election.
House lawyers said the Supreme Court ""has long recognized that Congress may investigate potential wrongdoing if the investigation relates to a valid legislative purpose.""
But Trump's team says the committees' real pursuit isn't legislation but law enforcement, a goal the president's team says is beyond Congress' constitutional authority.
""The events that led to the subpoenas' issuance, the public statements surrounding these investigations, the nature of these demands themselves, and other evidence confirm that the committees' purpose is to find out if the president broke the law,"" Trump's private lawyers argued.
In the grand jury case, Trump contends the president has complete immunity from criminal investigations while in office. He says that any investigation, even one in which the document demand goes to a third party, risks being a distraction from the chief executive's responsibilities.
""The president cannot effectively discharge those duties if any and every prosecutor in this country may target him with criminal process,"" Trump's lawyers argued.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is investigating whether the Trump Organization falsified business records to disguise hush payments to two women who claimed they had sex with Trump before he took office.
Vance and his supporters say presidents throughout history, including Nixon and Clinton, have been subject to judicial proceedings. Vance says a complete shield from investigation is especially inappropriate in a probe that doesn't touch on the president's official duties.
""Immunity from investigation for private conduct runs counter to precedent, the structure and operation of the Constitution, and the bedrock principle that no person is above the law,"" Vance argued."

Minnesota U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald announced Monday that $8 million will go to the state's Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding Program, which funds things like police overtime, equipment and medical needs.
The rest, $3.6 million, will go to jurisdictions in Minnesota deemed eligible by the Justice Department.
""These funds will provide additional resources for our dedicated public safety officials as they continue to selflessly serve the public during this pandemic,"" MacDonald said in a statement. ""Additionally, these funds are designed to be flexible to support a wide range of initiatives and projects … to help keep our front line officers safe."""
"May 11, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-nonprofits-lost-about-1-billion-in-april-because-of-covid-19/570384302/,StarTribune,Minnesota nonprofits lost about $1 billion in April because of COVID-19,"Minnesota nonprofits lost an estimated $1 billion in revenue in April because the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of fundraising events and reductions or closures of other revenue-generating programs.
The Minnesota Council of Nonprofits has released the results of a survey of the state's nonprofits, part of a national survey conducted in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank on how the coronavirus outbreak and economic downturn are affecting the sector.
Arts and health nonprofits took the biggest hits, but the entire sector is facing a financial crisis, with nearly all nonprofits facing some level of disruption.
""It's going to be substantial impact for an unknown period of time,"" said Jon Pratt, executive director of the statewide council. ""We're going to have to do things differently because the needs will have shifted dramatically, but also the resource base.""
Minnesota has more than 9,000 nonprofits, with a record 385,000 workers who make up 13.3% of the state's workforce. In late March, Gov. Tim Walz ordered nonessential businesses to close and residents to stay home in an effort to stem the coronavirus contagion.
Many nonprofits don't have much of a financial cushion and have seen critical revenue evaporate — from program fees to charitable giving. Of 528 nonprofits that responded to the survey, nearly half have three months of cash or less on hand, expecting to be in financial distress within a matter of months.
As a result, some nonprofits may not survive the crisis. Others will shrink in size or change how they deliver their services, Pratt said.
To compensate for lost revenue, nearly half the nonprofits either decreased staffing or expect to do so. As of early April, the most recent data available, nonprofits accounted for 6% of unemployment claims in Minnesota. Some nonprofits, such as the Minnesota Children's Museum, Science Museum of Minnesota and Minnesota Historical Society, have issued furloughs or temporary layoffs.
According to the statewide survey, released Friday, about 40% of nonprofits expect to see, or have seen a drop in fees as programs remain closed. About 20% are seeing or expecting to see a drop in government contracts, which many health and human services organizations rely on. And arts organizations, which depend on ticket sales for, on average, half their revenue, now face canceled events.
Half of nonprofits surveyed said they have also lost or expect to lose some donations.
""There's catastrophic revenue loss,"" Kari Aanestad, director of advancement for the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits.
Individual giving has ticked upward as result of the pandemic, but it's unclear if it will last. Susie Brown, president of the Minnesota Council on Foundations, said she expects foundations to continue giving grants. ""Foundations are looking to increase giving right now,"" Brown said.
Foundations across the state have launched new COVID-19 emergency funds and many have backed a Minnesota Disaster Recovery Fund, about $6 million of which already has been handed out to nonprofits, community organizations and tribes.
It's unclear how many Minnesota nonprofits benefited from the federal Paycheck Protection Program, but another study conducted by the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits this month will seek to answer that question and assess the sector's health.
One silver lining of the crisis: It's prompting nonprofits to develop new skills, to collaborate in new ways, and to diversify revenue sources. One organization that had studied telehealth delivery for four years figured out how to launch a program in just four days because of the crisis, Pratt said."

Allergy season is in full swing in Minnesota. And with anxieties high about the coronavirus, some patients are confusing allergy symptoms with the virus.
“Patients don’t really know the difference between shortness of breath from COVID-19 vs. shortness of breath from increased allergies. So patients are very concerned,” said Dr. Gary Berman, a physician at Allergy & Asthma Specialists, which has offices in Minneapolis, Plymouth and Edina.
The Twin Cities is a pollen hot spot, according to the Weather Channel, with “very high” levels of tree pollen. (Birch, ash and maple are big contributors to allergies in the region.)
Connie Krejci, 75, has struggled with year-round allergies her entire adult life. She is a resident of St. Paul’s Highland Park, a neighborhood abundant with greenery.
“My eyes are watering, my nose is watering, I’m sneezing and I get asthma,” said Krejci, who takes three medications to mitigate her symptoms.
The thought that she could have COVID-19 has crossed her mind a few times. “Especially when my chest hurts or I’m short of breath,” she said. “But my nose is running and my eyes are running, and I’m not feeling sick, so that indicates allergies to me.”
Two weeks ago the federal Centers for Disease Control added six new symptoms — chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of taste or smell — to its original list of coronavirus indicators (fever, cough, shortness of breath).
People who are having trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, bluish lips or face, or a newfound sense of confusion and difficulty in waking up, are advised to call 911 and get medical attention immediately.
If you’re like Krejci or one of 50 million other Americans who suffer from allergies each year, there are ways to alleviate the symptoms. Berman suggests taking antihistamines, showering after outdoor exposure, using eye drops and even getting allergy shots. Finding out exactly what you are allergic to can help you avoid it, Berman said.
And if your allergies are unbearable, make a virtual appointment.
“Patients don’t really know that allergy offices are still open,” Berman said. We’re open for allergy shots and we’re doing telehealth to help people through this very concerning time.” Clinics are asking people to schedule appointments instead of walk-ins, and inquiring about patients’ symptoms before admitting them.
The Minnesota Department of Health has a hotline available for health questions from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily at 651-201-3920 or 1-800-657-3903. Interpreters are available.

"May 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/making-sense-of-covid-19-fatality-rates/570385502/,StarTribune,Making sense of COVID-19 fatality rates,"The case fatality rate for the seasonal flu is about 0.1 to 0.2%. It means that for every 10,000 people with a documented case of the flu, 10 to 20 will die.
This method of calculation is often what people use if they casually cite a death rate. But it’s not the most accurate way to estimate your personal risk of dying if you become host to the agents of a disease. That would be the infection fatality rate. For the flu, by one account, it’s 0.04%. That means for every 10,000 people who are infected, whether they report it or not, four ultimately will perish.
You’ll see that the extra numeral after the decimal point makes a difference. But you’ll also notice that we’ve gone from a rate that can be calculated with hard data to one that must be inferred.
Store those figures in your temporary memory. They’ll be relevant for comparison as Minnesota considers not just whether to lift orders to stay at home during the COVID-19 outbreak but also how best to arrange things if it does. The current order is set to expire next Monday, so another update is coming soon.
Fatality rates are not fixed. They can vary by patients’ ages and overall health, among other things, and they can be bent by what medical professionals learn about treating a disease. The circumstances around this new strain of coronavirus have been nothing if not nebulous, but two months into the arc of the pandemic, we can begin to discern a shape.
As of Monday in Minnesota, 11,799 cases of the disease had been confirmed by laboratory testing. There were 591 deaths. Case fatality rate? Simple math. Divide the smaller number by the larger, and you get 5%. That’s in range of the 6% figure globally for people with a diagnosis.
Infection fatality rate? Here you must make an assumption: How many unreported cases might there be? Last month before testing ramped up in Minnesota, state officials thought it could be 100 times more than reported ones. Provisional antibody tests in other parts of the country have put it closer to 10 times more. This results in an ambiguous estimate for the rate — anywhere from 0.05 to 0.5%.
Those arguing against stay-at-home orders are banking on lower rates for COVID-19 in the end analysis. Figures of less than 1% for the case fatality rate and as low as 0.1% for the infection fatality rate have been suggested.
So far in Minnesota, about 4 of every 5 fatalities have occurred in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities, and 99.24% of those who have died had an underlying health condition (as discussed in an editorial Sunday). It is indeed plausible that the rates will settle as the virus works into less vulnerable segments of the population. By how much?
There’s an example in which nearly an entire population was tested: that of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had 3,711 passengers and crew members aboard and was the subject of a follow-up study. (Though not an exact comparison to poll methodology, that number of people would be a statistically significant sample size if applied to Minnesota’s population — for a recent Star Tribune/MPR News Minnesota Poll, 800 people sufficed.) As a caveat, a cruise ship can be a rather ideal petri dish, but among those 3,711 people, the case fatality rate was 2.6%, and the infection fatality rate — which includes those who had no symptoms at the time of the test — was 1.3%.
Outcomes can depend on how much virus a person is initially exposed to. The implication is that even as restrictions are lifted or adjusted, distance will matter. May keeping our distance be as easily done as it is said.
Minnesota’s stay-at-home order began March 27. When weeks stretch to months, anyone’s resolve can be tested. But for now — despite the skepticism, despite the protests — it appears that most Americans prefer to go slow in the face of uncertainty. A collection of recent polls found support for an immediate reopening of the economy ranging from 10 to 35%."
"May 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/calculating-cost-of-life-lockdown-is-worth-it/570418222/,StarTribune,"Calculating cost of life, lockdown is worth it","One of the difficulties in analyzing the trade-offs between policies to slow the spread of the coronavirus vs. the damage to the economy of lockdown measures is that the benefits are measured in lives saved, while the costs are measured in dollars of economic loss.
It is hard to compare the costs and the benefits when the two are measured in different units.
But we do have a way of measuring lives lost or saved in terms of dollars. It is called the “value of statistical life” and is used by government to make policy trade-offs between spending money and saving lives. While the procedure sounds cold and inhuman, we do need some way of evaluating these trade-offs.
Obviously, we can’t spend billions or trillions of dollars to save a single life. Just as obviously, we can’t morally justify not spending one dollar if it would save thousands of lives. So we do have to figure out how much we are willing to spend, or lose, to prevent deaths if we are going to enact reasonable policies.
In the United States, government guidance is to use $10 million as the value of a statistical life. That is, we should be willing to spend $10 million to prevent one death. Likewise, if a single life is lost, then we should record a $10 million loss of value from our economy.
Given this number, if we can estimate how many lives will be lost under different policies to control the coronavirus, we can compare the economic value of the lives lost to the damage done to our economy.
Even without social distancing, the pandemic would cause a hit to the economy due to a loss of productivity because of illness and overloading of the health care system. So the cost of doing nothing and letting the pandemic run its course is not zero.
A group of scientists at the University of Wyoming used these facts to estimate whether social distancing policies would make economic sense. They used numbers from the government and Goldman-Sachs to estimate the economic effects. You can download their research and see all the details at: tinyurl.com/socialdistancingcost.
To summarize, here is what they found:
• Without any social distancing, we could expect 2.18 million deaths, for an imputed economic impact of $21.8 trillion. We could also expect the economy to take a $6.49 trillion hit compared with what would have occurred if the pandemic had not existed. This is a total economic value loss of $28.29 trillion.
• With effective social distancing, we could expect 0.949 million deaths, for an imputed economic impact of $9.41 trillion. We could also expect the economy to take a $13.7 trillion hit compared with a no-pandemic scenario. This is a total economic value loss of $23.11 trillion.
What this means is that the total economic cost of the pandemic — when the imputed cost of deaths and the hit to the economy are both taken into account — would be about $5 trillion less with effective social distancing than without it.
Putting this in current terms, ending social distancing policies too soon could result in a loss of value to the U.S. of around $5 trillion. Nobody would take $5 trillion out of the bank and burn it. But based on what these scientists calculated, ending social distancing now is basically the equivalent of doing just that.
Those who would argue that this calculation is wrong need to make a convincing case that the arguments presented in the research paper are mistaken. It isn’t a case of political ideology. It is a matter of economic projections based on observation and scientific reasoning. Any valid argument against social distancing needs to be made on that same basis."
"May 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/covid-19-enters-the-white-house/570418142/,StarTribune,COVID-19 enters the White House,"The White House knows what it takes to limit the spread of COVID-19. That became obvious when the virus that has swept the globe began infecting staffers close to the president and vice president.
Quickly, the White House adopted the very measures that the administration, especially President Donald Trump, has not consistently endorsed. Masks are now worn by staffers operating in the West Wing. Those in proximity to leaders are tested daily, as are President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Those infected, who now include Trump's personal valet and Pence's chief spokeswoman, are quarantined. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's most respected voice on the pandemic, opted for voluntary self-quarantine after contact tracing determined he had been exposed to someone with the virus.
Those are all entirely sensible steps recommended by infectious disease experts — and the White House itself in its April ""Open Up America Again"" plan.
The accepted, rational strategy of test, trace and isolate is one that should be the foundation of the nation's defense system against a virus that as yet still has no known treatment, cure or vaccine. It would be vastly more productive than the president frantically tweeting that states struggling to contain the spread be ""liberated,"" or his questioning the value of widespread testing.
The testing that was so scarce for so long is now becoming pervasive enough that states can begin determining the number of symptomatic cases. But that's not enough to determine the true spread of this virus. For that you need broader testing of those who are asymptomatic. Tellingly, in its efforts to control its own spread, the White House is testing not just staffers who are symptomatic, but anyone close to top leaders. That is how you find carriers.
Health officials in Minnesota have said they remain unable to fully track disease spread because of the lack of widespread testing, although testing is increasing. It is an unnecessary burden they have carried for months, due in large measure to a federal government that for too long failed to make widespread testing and tracing part of a national strategy. No one has a magic bullet when it comes to this new and confounding virus, whose dimensions are still being discovered. But we do have tried and true tools that are aided by leaders who publicly embrace the use of such measures, without partisan division.
Pence, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, has declined to isolate himself even after knowing he was exposed to the virus by his press secretary, Katie Miller. Meanwhile, Fauci, the nation's most respected voice on the pandemic, along with Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all voluntarily self-quarantined after contact with those who tested positive.
Dispelling fear in a pandemic is no small task. It is not accomplished by rhetorical commands to simply stop being afraid. Nor is it accomplished by repeated boasts that the U.S. ""leads the world in testing,"" when the reality is we lag in per capita testing behind far smaller countries.
We need a national strategy built around the same measures the White House knew to adopt when the safety of the nation's leaders mattered."
"May 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-lawmakers-anticipate-new-pandemic-emergency-order/570412702/,StarTribune,Minnesota lawmakers anticipate new peacetime emergency order from Gov. Tim Walz,"Legislative leaders in St. Paul are readying for Wednesday’s expected extension of peacetime emergency powers that have enabled Gov. Tim Walz to temporarily close schools, shutter businesses and order residents to stay home unless necessary.
Walz administration officials remained tight-lipped Tuesday about the announcement as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities in Minnesota continued to rise. But leaders in both parties in the Capitol said they fully expect the governor to extend the emergency powers he has wielded since the pandemic began to ramp up in March.
A 30-day extension to June 12 would allow Walz to maintain or modify his current stay-at-home order and business closings, which otherwise would expire on Monday. The DFL governor has gradually dialed back his restrictions on businesses deemed essential, and further changes could be announced later this week.
Walz’s first stay-at-home order in March exempted 78% of jobs deemed essential. By last week, when he lifted restrictions on elective surgeries, roughly 91% of workers could remain on their jobs, he said. Some workers, including health care workers, might be furloughed from critical industries, however, because of the economic downturn.
Facing a Wednesday expiration date for his current state of emergency, Walz has felt increasing pressure from Republicans in the Legislature to end his unilateral powers and allow more businesses to reopen so long as they follow state and federal safety and social distancing guidelines.
Last week, Walz hinted that the peacetime emergency would probably be extended.
“I think it more than likely that we will at this time,” Walz said on May 5.
Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm declined to comment Tuesday on the timing of announcements about the peacetime emergency or the stay-at-home order.
But she echoed what Walz has said previously when asked about a widespread opening of businesses and activities.
“As we start to see more interactions in the community and more contacts among people it is quite natural to expect … that we will see increased cases,” Malcolm said. “Our whole goal is to see that happen in a way that is measured and in a way that the health care system is prepared to respond to.”
State officials said a new public health model developed by researchers at the University of Minnesota will be one factor in helping them evaluate the potential impact of changes in policy and that they hope to get the results within the next few days.
“The university folks are making sure that that new run is available to the governor,” Malcolm said.
Powers would extend session
Walz’s decision comes as public health experts warn against relaxing stay-at-home orders too quickly, even as President Donald Trump urges governors to open up and kick-start a sputtering economy.
Among the most prominent voices is Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, who warned Congress on Tuesday of “really serious” consequences of death and economic damage if authorities lift their coronavirus measures prematurely.
Fauci expressed sympathy for the plight of Jomari de Jesus, an uninsured worker at a turkey processing plant in Willmar, Minn., who has tested positive for COVID-19. In response to a question from Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith seeking guidance, Fauci said companies have a “moral responsibility” to protect workers like de Jesus, who works for a contractor that cleans a Jennie-O processing plant and was profiled Sunday in the Star Tribune.
“It would seem if you want to keep … plants open you’ve really got to provide the optimum degree of protection for the workers involved, the ability to allow them to go to work safely, and if and when individuals get infected to immediately be able to get them out and give them the proper care,” Fauci said.
In St. Paul, the GOP-led Senate passed legislation Monday to reopen businesses in the state, and Republicans in the House have warned that they have enough votes to block a massive public works bonding bill unless Walz ends the peacetime emergency.
The deadline comes five days ahead of the Legislature’s scheduled adjournment date on Monday. According to the law, after lawmakers go home for the year, they are automatically called back into session if the governor extends a state of peacetime emergency for another 30 days. When they come back, they can reject the extension, but they don’t have to cast a ballot to approve it.
The expectation of a special session in June has thrown open the bonding bill and several other deals lawmakers had been expected to conclude in the waning days of the Legislature. Other pieces of unfinished business include raises for state government workers, pandemic aid, and an economic relief package to help the state recover from the coronavirus emergency.
“I’m hopeful we’ll get it done, but with the June 12 date, if the governor wants to extend his emergency powers we’re automatically back into a special session,” Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said in an interview last week. “That makes this year more different than any year. Normally in a special session a leader signs off on what it includes, under this scenario that would be different, so it’s going to be a unique year.”
Cases still climbing
House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said she expects the governor will extend the state of peacetime emergency. Models done around the country showing the coronavirus’s progression make it clear the state hasn’t reached the peak of its surge yet, she said, and the number of cases in Minnesota is increasing. There are also significant emergencies the governor needs to deal with in long-term care and the meatpacking industry, Hortman added.
Democrats also argue for the flexibility Walz needs as the virus continues its spread in Minnesota.
“The governor and his administration are doing a phenomenal job managing this emergency,” Hortman said. “And since he has had those peacetime emergency powers activated, since March 13, he has done a number of things at a level of speed that the Legislature doesn’t have.”
But House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said the need for a peacetime emergency is over.
“While it certainly was appropriate at the time he did it, the time for needing that swift emergency action is passed,” he said. “Now we’re at the point we can be a little more thoughtful and deliberative and inclusive in the decisionmaking process.”
Daudt said while he wants to see a bonding bill come together, his caucus is holding firm on its position to withhold votes on that package until after the peacetime emergency is over. He pointed to previously released epidemiological models showing similar results between the current strategy and a more targeted approach that focuses on isolating only the elderly and high risk.
“I want us to follow data,” Daudt said. “I think at some point it appears the governor made a switch from making sure we controlled the spread so it spread more slowly and protected our high-risk and older people, [to] a strategy to prevent all Minnesotans from getting COVID.”
With 695 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 23 additional deaths reported Tuesday, the state has seen 12,494 infections and 614 deaths, including 501 among residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities."
"May 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/we-treated-older-coronavirus-patients-here-s-how-to-save-more-of-them/570437022/,StarTribune,We treated older coronavirus patients. Here's how to save more of them.,"We are emergency and intensive-care doctors who have worked in three hothouses of the COVID-19 pandemic: northern Italy, New York City and Miami. Treating scores of critically ill patients, we all observed similar patterns: Many of the patients we saw in our emergency rooms had advanced cases of COVID-19 pneumonia when they arrived — and many of those critically ill patients came from nursing homes.
More often than not, these older pneumonia patients wound up on ventilators. This is almost always a bad outcome. In New York City, an astronomical 80% of patients who required a ventilator at the height of this pandemic died, according to city and state officials. (In our experience, the death rate among patients not requiring a ventilator has been relatively low.) Similarly, we see evidence that the incidence of blood clots and renal failure in patients on ventilators is significantly greater than in patients who were less sick and didn’t need a ventilator.
This data does not mean that the machines themselves are killing people, just that by the time those patients are being hooked up to ventilators, they are already in dire condition.
How then do we identify patients with COVID-19 pneumonia earlier so that they can be treated before requiring a ventilator? As one of us, Dr. Levitan, noted in an earlier commentary (“What I learned during 10 days of treating COVID pneumonia,” StarTribune.com, April 22), clinicians have a universally available, quick and remarkably effective tool to detect the attack on the lungs caused by COVID-19 pneumonia: pulse oximetry.
The pulse oximeter is a small device that attaches to the tip of a finger, and in 15 seconds measures oxygen saturation of the blood. Invented by Takuo Aoyagi and Michio Kishi in 1974, it is now considered one of the vital signs in medicine (along with pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature and blood pressure). Mr. Aoyagi, who died on April 18, has had an incalculable impact on patient safety worldwide — and his contribution is especially significant in this pandemic.
In an analysis of more than 4,000 COVID-19 patients evaluated between March 1 and April 7 at NYU Langone Health facilities, one of the strongest predictors of critical illness — defined as involving ICU care or mechanical ventilation — was the patient’s oxygen saturation on arrival at the hospital.
It is time, then, for the federal government, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to mandate that all nursing homes and long-term-care facilities — tied to a third of the COVID-19 deaths — do pulse oximetry monitoring at least daily. In facilities with known coronavirus infections, we suggest this be checked twice a day.
COVID-19 pneumonia generally develops between five and 10 days after infection. It does not cause shortness of breath in most patients. Oxygen levels drop over days, and patients gradually increase their respiratory rate. The low oxygen saturation happens silently — silent hypoxia, we call it — and patients do not realize it. By the time patients feel shortness of breath or have evident trouble breathing and head to the hospital, they already have alarmingly low oxygen saturations.
A majority of COVID-19 pneumonia patients that we treated or observed during the surges in New York City and Italy had severe lung injury on first presentation. They were, in other words, arriving at the hospital too late, and many were winding up on ventilators.
In all medicine — whether in patients who have traumatic injury, cancer, diabetes or an infectious disease — earlier identification and treatment leads to better outcomes. COVID-19 is no different. We must continue improving the ICU care of patients with advanced COVID-19 pneumonia. But we will have the greatest public health impact if we prevent it from occurring in the first place.
The value of early detection has become apparent in northern Italy, once the epicenter of the pandemic. The surge there has abated, and patients are no longer afraid to come to the emergency department. That means patients with symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, muscle aches and cough, are coming to the hospital earlier — and their illness is less severe.
There is some heartening evidence — admittedly inconclusive — that earlier treatment makes a difference. In a small pilot study of 250 COVID-19 cases conducted by Dr. Cosentini in Italy, half were found to have mild pneumonia — but their oxygen saturation was not yet compromised. All of these patients were able to be discharged from the ER, and they were sent home with pulse oximeters. Only 5% returned and were hospitalized when their oxygen saturation levels declined slightly. None of these patients required a ventilator. And none of these 250 patients died.
While there is no specific cure for COVID-19 and we have nothing that directly kills the virus, we do have treatments that help patients and prevent the need for a ventilator. These include various noninvasive methods of delivering oxygen, patient positioning maneuvers that open up parts of the lungs, and close monitoring and treatment of inflammation. There is no panacea; some patients will still have the disease worsen, and there are some patients who will still have serious injury from COVID-19 unrelated to the lungs.
Until now the manner in which our health care system has addressed this crisis has failed. But doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists want to win. We want to tell families their loved ones are recovering and not dying. Everyone hopes new therapies and ultimately a vaccine will help defeat COVID-19. But until the magic bullets arrive, we must engage this disease differently — that is, earlier — if we are going to save lives and reduce the immense cost of care.
For our country to benefit from this strategy, we need to completely change public health messaging and create a new standard of care — and that messaging must come from the federal government. If the CDC leads, health agencies around the world will follow."
"May 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/older-minnesota-voters-file-suit-to-change-absentee-voting-rules/570446392/,StarTribune,Older Minnesota voters file suit to change absentee voting rules amid COVID-19 fears,"A group of older Minnesota voters is suing the secretary of state over concerns that the state's absentee voting rules could put their vote — and their health — at risk this year.
Part of a broader movement to change absentee rules across at least five states, the Minnesota challenge argues that many older voters who are self-quarantining to avoid contracting the COVID-19 virus won't be able to get the required witness signatures on their mail-in ballots.
The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Ramsey County District Court by the Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans Educational Fund, looks to stop the state from enforcing that requirement and also to adopt a postmark deadline on mail-in ballots.
State law requires absentee ballots to be hand-delivered to county elections offices by 3 p.m. on Election Day or received by mail by 8 p.m. in order to be counted. Anticipating a dramatic uptick in mail voting because of an expected spike this fall in COVID-19 cases, the plaintiffs worry a cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service may not be able to deliver such ballots in time.
Secretary of State Steve Simon's office declined to comment on the litigation.
The lawsuit follows similar legal actions this year via state chapters of the Alliance for Retired Americans in Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. Minnesota plaintiffs include senior voters with pre-existing health problems like Teresa Maples, a 66-year-old voter in Red Wing.
""There is no question that I will be unable to vote in person because I am strictly following the social distancing and self-isolation guidelines,"" Maples said in a statement Wednesday. ""Because I live alone and cannot safely obtain a witness signature, my vote may never be counted.""
The legal challenge comes a day after Gov. Tim Walz signed into law a $17 million elections assistance package aimed at helping state and local election workers carry out the Aug. 11 primary and Nov. 3 general elections amid the coronavirus pandemic. The bill included extra money for personal protective and sanitizing equipment and gave officials more time to process absentee ballots.
Missing from the bill was a measure to adopt universal mail-in voting for the two elections, a proposal championed by Democratic lawmakers and Simon. Walz this week voiced support for universal mail-in voting — which would have allowed Simon's office to mail all registered voters ballots to complete — and a press secretary said the governor was ""considering next steps in how to ensure Minnesotans are safely able to exercise their right to vote.""
Simon's office has meanwhile shifted to urging as many voters as possible to request absentee ballots before the elections. On Wednesday, it opened an online absentee ballot request tool for registered voters to make such requests.
""We need to treat the upcoming statewide elections as a public health issue,"" Simon said in a statement announcing the online request portal on Wednesday. ""To slow the spread of COVID-19 we need to reduce large gatherings, including at polling places. I'm challenging all eligible Minnesota voters to cast their vote from the safety of their home. In the face of this pandemic, it is the right thing to do to protect Minnesotans who are most at risk — and the people who care for them. Fortunately, it's very easy to do.""
But Wednesday's lawsuit in Ramsey County assailed as ""unduly burdensome"" Minnesota's requirement that absentee voters get another voter or notary signature to complete their ballot.
The plaintiffs also want Simon to adopt a postmark deadline for this year's absentee ballots — similar to what Wisconsin did before its April elections.
About a quarter of all Minnesota voters who participated in the 2018 midterm election did so by mail, but that number is expected to soar this year.
Half of the 7,519 absentee ballots discarded by the state in 2018 were tossed because they arrived after the deadline. Wednesday's lawsuit alleges that the requirement would ""disenfranchise tens of thousands more voters this year than in years past.""
To vote absentee, Minnesota voters must first complete an absentee ballot application, receive the ballot in the mail and get a signature from another registered voter, notary or person otherwise authorized to administer oaths. The voter must then mail the ballot with enough time for it to meet the 8 p.m. Election Day receipt deadline.
""The steps … which are required to successfully vote absentee, are not insubstantial, often requiring voters to expend significant time, effort, and sometimes money to complete,"" wrote Sybil Dunlop, an attorney for the plaintiffs, in the civil complaint filed Wednesday. ""A misstep at any point — including by elections officials or the USPS, not just the voter — often results in complete disenfranchisement.""
In a statement, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's National Redistricting Foundation expressed support for the lawsuit, which it is also financially and operationally backing.
""The botched and gerrymandered primary election right next door in Wisconsin showed us exactly what happens when a state is unprepared for a substantial increase in voting by mail,"" Holder said. ""Minnesota must act now to ensure that its voters are not severely and unjustifiably burdened by unnecessary obstacles to casting a ballot at home."""
"May 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/welcome-back-barack-what-took-you-so-long/570472152/,StarTribune,"Welcome back, Barack. What took you so long?","It’s about time.
After more than three years of relative self-restraint while President Donald Trump lambasted his character and eviscerated his policies, former President Barack Obama has waded back into politics just in time for the presidential campaign.
In a videoconference with some 3,000 former aides last week, Obama slammed Trump’s response to the coronavirus crisis as an unbridled catastrophe, criticism he knew would leak.
Obama acknowledged that the pandemic “would have been bad even with the best of governments,” but added that it “has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mind-set — of ‘what’s in it for me?’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’ — when that mind-set is operationalized in our government.”
Not surprisingly, Trump didn’t take the criticism well.
“We are getting great marks for the handling of the Coronavirus pandemic,” the president replied on Twitter. “Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls — didn’t have a clue!”
For those who have forgotten, the H1N1 influenza hit America in 2009 soon after Obama and his vice president, Joe Biden, took office. Over the next year, 12,469 Americans died from the disease.
More than 82,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 in the last three months. It’s an odd comparison for Trump to choose.
That wasn’t the only scuffle. Obama also took aim at Attorney General William Barr’s decision to ask a judge to drop charges against Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.
Obama said Barr’s decision undermined the integrity of the Justice Department. “Our basic understanding of the rule of law is at risk,” he warned.
“OBAMAGATE!” Trump roared back (on Twitter, again), reviving his crackpot theory that Obama concocted a conspiracy to destroy his presidency by launching the Russia investigation that indicted 34 people, including Flynn.
So much for comity between presidents and their predecessors.
Actually, that tradition has been violated before. Theodore Roosevelt called William Howard Taft, whom he had hand-picked to succeed him, a “fathead.” Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton all found something to criticize in the policies of those who followed.
Still, Trump has scored a dubious achievement: Alone among recent presidents, he has drawn criticism from all his living predecessors, Carter, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama.
His brawl with Obama has been brewing for years. Long before Trump launched his 2016 campaign, he claimed falsely that the first African-American president wasn’t born in the United States.
Candidate Trump said Obama was “perhaps the worst president” in history. He blamed Obama for a long list of purported sins, from the 2015 deal that successfully rolled back Iran’s nuclear program to allegedly being responsible for Trump’s own failure to deploy widespread testing for the coronavirus.
The surprise is how rarely Obama responded. But now, it appears, his gloves are coming off.
After Trump alleged Monday that his predecessor had committed crimes but refused to tell reporters what they were, Obama issued an instant and acid response: “When even [Trump] can’t explain his own conspiracy theory, you know the White House has fallen on tough times.”
All this matters because it could change the trajectory of the 2020 presidential campaign.
Obama’s refusal to endorse Biden until he had locked up the Democratic presidential nomination gave some supporters heartburn. But Obama is backing him now, and Trump has given him more reasons than ever.
People who have talked with Obama say he’s eager to get involved. He’s giving Biden strategy advice by phone and is recruiting former aides — including those on the conference call — to help.
“President Obama believes this election is too important for anyone to sit out,” his spokeswoman, Katie Hill, told me Tuesday. “He looks forward to campaigning aggressively this year for Biden.”
Obama is exactly the wingman Biden needs. The former vice president is running as the candidate of restoration, to return the country to the relatively placid days of what he calls the “Obama-Biden administration.”
Obama can testify to Biden’s fitness for the job as no one else can. He can help Biden energize African-American voters, an important part of the coalition that won two presidential elections. He may be able to help the 77-year-old Biden draw more young voters and bring a dose of excitement to his campaign.
If the race is just Trump vs. Biden, Trump stands a chance. If it’s viewed as Trump vs. Obama, the incumbent has a bigger problem. In a 2018 poll, 56% of Americans said Obama was a better president against 37% for Trump.
Unlike Trump, who can commandeer Air Force One, Biden is stuck campaigning from his home in Delaware, a state still under a shutdown order. His campaign aims to deploy an army of surrogates to try to energize the unruly constituencies of the Democratic Party, with Obama as Surrogate No. 1.
It just might work. By November, Trump may regret his strange, endless grudge match with Barack Obama."
"May 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/walz-considers-next-steps-to-increase-mail-in-voting-in-minnesota/570415312/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz considers 'next steps' to increase mail-in voting,"Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday said he favors conducting Minnesota's elections primarily by mail after a proposal to expand mail-in voting during the pandemic was struck from a $17 million elections package state lawmakers sent to his desk this week.
The legislation the DFL governor signed Tuesday represents a setback for Democrats in Washington and Minnesota who had sought to expand voting by mail during the COVID-19 emergency and into the 2020 elections. But Walz indicated he is looking at other options to make it easier to vote by mail.
""The Governor supports universal mail-in voting, especially during this pandemic and considering a second wave of COVID-19 could hit this fall ahead of the November election,"" said Teddy Tschann, the governor's press secretary. ""He is considering next steps in how to ensure Minnesotans are safely able to exercise their right to vote.""
Executive action by the governor likely became the only way that the state's Aug. 11 and Nov. 3 elections could be conducted by mail-in balloting after a proposal championed by DFL lawmakers and Secretary of State Steve Simon was dropped from the bill funding statewide elections.
A DFL proposal to send all registered Minnesota voters ballots by mail quickly became a nonstarter in the Legislature, where Republicans in the GOP-held Senate raised questions about fraud and challenged the integrity of the process. Voters can still request ballots by mail, and state and local elections officials are now urging voters to do so this year.
""A big focus of our office and all elections offices around the state now is to make voters aware of that option ... and encourage voters if they have concerns about polling places to use that option,"" Simon said.
Roughly a quarter of Minnesota voters cast their ballots by mail in 2018. Simon wants to increase that number to reduce crowding and long lines at polling places.
The $17 million approved by the Legislature comes from two pools of money: federal election security funds allocated as part of the Help America Vote Act, and money made available by Congress through recent COVID-19 aid. Congressional Democrats are also seeking an additional $3.6 billion in election assistance money as part of a fourth coronavirus relief bill unveiled Tuesday.
Minnesota's $17 million deal also required Republicans to give up on key priorities — mainly provisional balloting and voter ID. The result: a compromise package narrowly tailored toward making millions of dollars available to elections officials statewide.
Under the legislation, state and local elections officials have more flexibility to move polling places — more than 40 are in nursing homes or senior care facilities and others in schools — and more time to process absentee ballots.
The package also provides additional funding for postage and paper needed to accommodate an expected uptick in voters participating by mail. Local elections officials also can use the money to hire staff or buy personal protective equipment, plexiglass and sanitizing materials.
""This year is the year that we needed to focus on COVID relief, safe and secure elections in the state of Minnesota,"" said state Sen. Mary Kiffmeyer, a Big Lake Republican and former secretary of state who chairs a Senate committee on elections. ""We put that as a priority.""
Simon and DFL lawmakers say they also are trying to avoid the chaos that marked the Wisconsin presidential primary and Supreme Court election last month. So far, nearly 70 voters are believed to have been infected after spending hours waiting in lines outside polling places. The state's absentee voting system was also marred by widespread crashes and administrative errors.
Walz has stopped short of vowing to mandate mail-in voting on his own, but he would not be the first governor to do so: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a similar order in late March.
In the meantime, Simon said his office is considering mailing absentee ballot applications to all registered voters, a move that would run afoul of GOP lawmakers. Kiffmeyer said the new election legislation does not provide funding for such a mass mailing, adding that state and local officials should instead educate voters on the availability of voting absentee.
Simon said he sees that as a major thrust of his office this year. ""I see my job in the next six months or so as ... just promoting this option for those who want to use it and being loud and clear that this law exists,"" he said. ""People who want to take advantage of it should take advantage of it … it is something for their own safety that they might want to do.""
Minnesota and other states also are bracing for a possible shortage of poll workers, many of whom may be senior citizens vulnerable to COVID-19. Simon said the state will need about 30,000 workers to staff polls statewide.
Ginny Gelms, Hennepin County election manager, said finding a solution to keep both voters and election workers safe ""is really going to hinge on as many people as possible voting by mail voluntarily.""
Last week, Kiffmeyer put out a call for younger people to do as she did at the start of her political career and apply to be elections judges. In Hennepin County, the search is on for younger people willing to answer that call.
""The reality is if we don't have people like that signing up, I honestly don't know how we're going to staff Election Day in November,"" Gelms said."
"May 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/walz-trades-stay-at-home-for-stay-safe-mn/570431912/,StarTribune,Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz loosens stay-at-home restrictions,"Gov. Tim Walz said Wednesday that he will allow stores to reopen and let Minnesotans leave the house more, while leaving in place for now restrictions for bars, restaurants, theaters, hair salons and other businesses where people must be in close contact.
The policy changes, delivered in a livestreamed address, means many small businesses and retailers can open their doors to customers Monday, as long as they have a plan to safeguard employees and customers through social distancing.
Bars, restaurants, barbershops and salons could open as early as June 1 if they meet safe opening plans that will be devised later this month by state health officials.
“The stay-at-home order is expiring and the dials are turning, but that doesn’t mean we are carefree and can return to the way things were,” Walz said. “It means we have to stay safe, take care, care for our own health and care for our neighbor.”
It’s a significant step in the governor’s response to the virus, loosening a stay-at-home order after nearly two months of restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But it’s not a wholesale reopening of the state.
Schools are already closed for the rest of the academic year, and a separate order closing events and businesses where people are in close contact will continue, as will restrictions on other public spaces and large religious services. Anyone who can work from home must, and gatherings — including those at churches, mosques and synagogues — must not exceed 10 people.
And while the governor will open retail stores and other Main Street businesses, their social distancing plans require them to operate at a maximum of 50% occupancy.
Walz also wants the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions that leave them at higher risk of severe illness to continue to stay home.
The new strategy is being dubbed “Stay Safe MN.” The current stay-at-home order — an extreme form of social distancing — was put in place March 28 while the state worked to increase hospital bed capacity and stockpiles of ventilators and personal protective equipment.
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, expressed support for the governor’s announcement, suggesting Walz had listened to GOP lawmakers and other critics pressing him to reopen more businesses,
“We’re moving in the right direction,” Gazelka said in a video released during Walz’s address. “This is really good news. I’m glad that he listened to us and I feel like we led the way. Now it’s up to us, you and me, that we practice safe distancing. I have every confidence we’re going to be able to do it. Minnesota is back on track.”
While officials have said the shutdowns delayed the peak of cases in Minnesota, new state modeling released hours before Walz’s address showed social distancing didn’t reduce face-to-face contact and disease transmission as much as anticipated.
Walz also extended for another 30 days a peacetime state of emergency that was set to expire Wednesday. The emergency powers have enabled him to take sweeping executive action such as the stay-at-home order and closing schools, bars and restaurants.
The use of those powers to respond to the crisis has divided top lawmakers at the Capitol. Republicans, frustrated with what they see as an overreliance on unilateral action, have urged the governor to end the state of emergency and work directly with the Legislature. Democrats say emergency powers, which have been enacted in all 50 states since the pandemic began, remain necessary in a fast-changing situation.
“There is still an emergency, and the key reason … is the executive has to be able to act quickly to deal with threats to human life and the kinds of things where you need a really fast response,” said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park.
Walz’s dialed-back strategy comes amid an increasingly partisan national debate about protecting public health and reopening the economy, as lawmakers in Washington and Minnesota scramble to keep up with the rapidly spreading virus.
Public health experts have cautioned against relaxing stay-at-home orders too quickly, saying such moves could lead to fresh flare-ups. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told Congress on Tuesday that premature lifting of coronavirus measures could lead to “really serious” consequences, including more death and economic damage.
A similar stay-at-home order in Wisconsin was in place until it was struck down Wednesday by the state’s Supreme Court. Michigan is keeping restrictions on movement in place at least until May 28. Officials in Los Angeles County in California expect a stay-at-home order to remain in place through the summer.
Walz’s address came hours after state health officials announced 24 more deaths from COVID-19, bringing the statewide toll to 638. The count of confirmed cases grew to 12,917 in Minnesota.
In his address, Walz suggested that a new influx of cases or other health indicators could trigger a decision to reimpose restrictions to combat the virus. “We must keep this virus at a simmer and not a boil,” Walz said.
Critics of the shutdowns have warned of dire economic damage. More than a half million Minnesotans have applied for unemployment since Walz’s original stay-at-home order in March. At the same time, the state has authorized a growing number of sectors to resume work. By last week, officials estimated that roughly 91% of workers could remain on their jobs.
The Department of Employment and Economic Development estimates that Walz’s new order will enable up to 37,000 more workers to safely return to work over the next several weeks.
Under Walz’s new order, state officials are expected to develop recommendations by May 20 to set the stage for more businesses to reopen with social distancing. Frequent hand-washing and use of masks will be strongly encouraged.
Representatives of the hardest-hit industries, along with top GOP lawmakers, have appealed to the governor to allow those establishments to reopen as long as they can follow social distancing guidelines. A lack of action, they say, would lead to permanent closures and lasting consequences for the state’s economy. Some have vowed to defy orders to remain closed.
Minnesota Chamber of Commerce President Doug Loon welcomed Walz’s move to partly reopen the economy. “Those who have not yet opened their physical doors have been taking responsible steps to design safe work environments and inspire consumer confidence,” he said.
Labor leaders say it will be incumbent upon companies to protect their workers. “The simple truth is that our economy cannot rebound unless employers are held accountable to implement safety measures to protect both workers and public health,” said Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bill McCarthy. “Failing to do so would result in more workers falling sick and even more economic damage.”
Walz also issued an executive order Wednesday protecting employees from discrimination or retaliation if they raise concerns about workplace safety.
The debate over the closures had intensified at the State Capitol in recent days as lawmakers scramble to reach accords on virus response measures before an adjournment deadline Monday. The GOP-led Senate recently approved a measure authorizing businesses to reopen, while the GOP minority in the House, frustrated with the governor’s use of executive power, has vowed to block a massive public construction borrowing bill until Walz ends the peacetime state of emergency.
Even with the looming legislative deadline, some of those fights may stretch into the summer. While the Legislature must adjourn Monday, an extension of the peacetime emergency until June 12 increases the likelihood that legislators will return to the Capitol this summer.
Under state law, legislators would be automatically called back into session next month if the governor extends a state of peacetime emergency for another 30 days. At that point, they could end an extension only if both chambers voted to reject it."
"May 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/anderson-minnesota-environment-loses-again-if-gop-has-its-way-with-trust-fund-money/570484962/,StarTribune,Minnesota environment loses again if GOP has its way with trust fund money,"Now again on a fine spring day we must consider anew the complexities that politics can make of simplicity, referencing here what should be the straightforward process of distributing money from the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF.)
Recall that at or about this time last year and also in 2018 I wrote columns suggesting that Republican legislators had made a banana republic-like laughingstock of the ENRTF appropriation process.
The heart of the matter then is not so different now: Senate Republicans, hesitant to fund through bonding much-needed rural wastewater treatment plants, intend instead to steer money from the ENRTF to those worthy causes.
The ENRTF was created when 77 % of Minnesota voters approved the state lottery in 1988. The marketing effort that underwrote the get-out-the-vote campaign supporting the lottery promised that fund proceeds would push back against the inexorable march of industry, agriculture and development that has diminished so much of Minnesota’s natural resources, beginning at statehood.
It wasn’t by accident then, nor is it now, that the state’s most beloved bird, the loon, is the lottery’s logo — suggesting as it obviously does that, while a Powerball ticket buyer might, and probably will, lose his $2 bet, the environment ultimately will be a winner.
Yet almost before the ink on the constitutional amendment establishing the lottery had dried, legislators had their sticky fingers in the cookie jar, reducing the amount of lottery proceeds dedicated to conservation and increasing the share going to the state’s general fund.
Still, and this is the good news, since 1991, lottery proceeds have paid for more than 1,700 conservation research, education and related projects statewide, totaling about $700 million.
Theoretically, the 17-member Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR) safeguards distribution of lottery proceeds.
Comprising five members of the House of Representatives, five from the Senate, five citizen-volunteers appointed by the governor and one citizen-volunteer each appointed by the two legislative chambers, the LCCMR meets regularly to consider and vote on funding requests.
When completed, the commission’s recommendations are forwarded to the Legislature, which historically has fiddled with them only slightly before sending the project list to the governor for his signature.
This year, because of the coronavirus threat, just about everything is different at the Legislature. This is especially true now, in the session’s last days — legislators adjourn Monday — as a massive bill encompassing not just ENRTF funding, but Department of Natural Resources and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency budgets and policy is considered in the House, and a similar measure, minus the ENRTF funding, is weighed in the Senate.
Leading the House DFL effort is Rep. Rick Hansen of South St. Paul and heading up the Senate side is Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen, R-Alexandria.
Both are members of the LCCMR, which this year had $61.3 million to distribute from the ENRTF, of which — this is the part in dispute — $1.5 million was assigned to wastewater-treatment-plant upgrades.
Opponents of the wastewater-treatment-plant assignments say that while loans for these purposes are legal from the fund, direct payment for such uses is unconstitutional.
Yet no one disputes that many Minnesota towns need their wastewater treatment facilities upgraded, a problem that is especially acute in rural areas, where the tax base is insufficient to support improvements. Which is why Gov. Tim Walz has included more than $200 million for this purpose in his bonding bill proposal.
Republicans, meanwhile, argue that every available penny should be used in these COVID-19-cash-strapped times to clean up the state’s waters, thus their appropriation request from the ENRTF.
Unfortunate in this mess is that Ingebrigtsen, the Republican senator, can be stubborn, but he’s a good guy. Like Hansen, he’s been a valuable player over the years on many conservation issues, and his vote will be needed again by those who support natural resource stewardship.
That said, he and other Senate Republicans who have threatened to hold up all ENRTF appropriations this year if they don’t get the $1.5 million for wastewater plants are on the wrong side of the issue.
What’s more, if lottery proceeds dedicated to the environment are going to be renewed by voters in 2025, these types of disputes, played out acrimoniously now for three years running, have to stop.
To that end, in the coming legislative offseason, Ingebrigtsen, Hansen and other LCCMR members should spearhead a review, with public input, of ENRTF appropriations, with a goal of (1) recommitting commission members to the fund’s original, voter-approved purposes, (2) thereby optimizing the fund’s conservation’s benefits to the state and its residents ..."

Health officials advised that the safest course was to maintain stay-at-home restrictions as hospitals increased their capacity to handle the most serious virus cases. Businesses hoped for a quick, safe return to something more like normality.
There was intense criticism from GOP leaders demanding that he give up his peacetime emergency powers and leave it to Minnesotans to decide for themselves how best to safely open their businesses and return to work.
In lifting some of the rules this week and allowing more businesses to reopen, Walz acknowledged the fine line he has had to walk.
“This is either going to work or not work,” he told reporters after announcing his decision. “People are either going to stay out of the hospital or get in it, depending on how much people think about why these things make a difference, how they slow the spread of the disease.”
Walz maintained that his decision was guided not by political pressure but by the data on the virus’ spread and the state’s ability to withstand the growing number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Those who know him say no deals were made.
In an interview on WCCO radio Thursday morning, the DFL governor said it was only “over the last week or so” that his administration had enough data to make the decision to allow stores to reopen and let Minnesotans leave their house more.
“Once we got those things in place, over the last 50 days, it’s over the last week or so we’re relatively confident. … It became apparent that you’re trying to weigh whether staying in and building up a little more is worth it compared to the damage it does economically, psychologically, and other health issues.”
In the end, he credited the majority of Minnesotans who adhered to social distancing guidelines.
“For the most part, Minnesotans did this,” Walz said. “I’ll be candid, I get it that we started to drop off a little bit on our social distancing. It’s summer. People started getting out their frustrations. ... Folks are going to go back to places that are safe.”
It is still not the full reopening of the state that many Republican legislators have pushed for.
A separate order closing bars, restaurants, hair salons, indoor stadiums and movie theaters remains in place until at least June 1, and social interactions are limited to groups of 10 people or fewer.
But observers say it’s a significant step in the governor’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and goes further than some Democratic governors in other states, who have extended stay-at-home orders to at least the end of May.
“It’s a risk-reward kind of equation that they’re working with,” said former Republican Gov. Arne Carlson. “There is no surefire strategy that is 100% perfect, so you’re weighing odds.”
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, praised the move to ease restrictions while saying stepped-up pressure from businesses and Republicans “led the way.”
On the Senate floor Thursday, Gazelka added that movement toward opening more businesses built good will with legislators, who are racing toward a Monday deadline to complete work in the regular 2020 legislative session. “I do think the governor lifting the stay-at-home order, that was a step that brought us all closer together,” he said.
At the same time, it remains to be seen if House Republicans will hold to their vow to block a major transportation infrastructure bonding bill until Walz ends his peacetime emergency powers, which he extended until June 12.
Adding to the pressure, lawsuits filed from businesses and some churches challenge the legality of his stay-at-home order.
On Wednesday, hours before his announcement, the Wisconsin Supreme Court knocked down Gov. Tony Evers’ similar “safer-at-home” order.
Walz and his DFL allies dismissed the idea that he was pressured by Republicans and businesses that were ready to flout a possible extension of his order. From the beginning, the stay-at-home order was designed to slow the peak number of coronavirus infections and build up hospital capacity and critical supplies such as ventilators and personal protective equipment, he said.
Those restrictions would eventually be lifted; it was just a matter of when the state felt prepared for an increase in cases winding up in the hospital.
Walz said they’ve reached that point of readiness. Other data also showed Minnesotans were getting restless. Based on cellphone tracking data, Minnesotans had recently dropped from an A grade in social distancing to a D, and new modeling from state health officials and the University of Minnesota released this week showed social distancing had not limited interactions between people as much as they’d hoped.
Charlie Weaver, executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership, said Walz’s new order gave some people hope that they’d hadn’t felt in awhile, including nodding to the possibility of reopening bars and restaurants soon.
“He walked the tightrope over the Grand Canyon pretty skillfully,” Weaver said. “Memorial Day is such a psychological guidepost for the summer. Being a Minnesotan, he recognized that. If he hadn’t given hope that we could get things somewhat back to normal around Memorial weekend, that would have been a challenge.”
But the move still has its detractors, including from those who worry it’s too soon to start lifting restrictions.
Shortly after the more relaxed “Stay Safe MN” order was announced, Minnesota Young DFL President Jason Chavez-Cruz tweeted, “And just like that your approval rating TANKED.” The Minnesota Nurses Association expressed concerns that increasing movement out into the world will increase cases in the hospitals at a time when they are still “dangerously rationing” personal protective equipment for health care workers.
“I think the governor has a very hard job balancing the harms. It’s not just money vs. lives. There’s much more to livelihoods and people staying at home,” said House DFL Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, noting that questions of domestic abuse and access to health care services are all factors. “It is a no-win, no-good-option scenario.”
For now, Walz said he’s putting his trust in Minnesotans to practice social distancing as they go back out into the world: Wear a mask, stay 6 feet away from others, gather in small groups and stay home if you’re at risk of severe illness or feeling sick."
"May 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/coronavirus-pandemic-god-speaks-to-us-in-the-challenges-he-sends/570518842/,StarTribune,Coronavirus pandemic: God speaks to us in the challenges he sends,"How should people of faith respond to the coronavirus? Recent media reports have pointed to a couple of possibilities.
Some believers in Minnesota have joined in a lawsuit, claiming their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion was being violated by a ban on in-person worship services.
A recent article in the New York Times said a few priests in the Orthodox church in Russia claimed that coming to services would actually protect people from getting the virus, like some sort of spiritual vaccine.
The general impression from such reports is that people of faith are either angry at their governments or looking to miracles. But isn’t there something more that could be said?
In my own Christian tradition — and I think there is overlap with Judaism and Islam — times of crisis are also understood as opportunities to reflect on what God might be saying. So, in the midst of a pandemic, how might God be seeking to get our attention? I am going to point to three things:
First, the pandemic is an opportunity to reevaluate what is truly important. People of faith confess regularly that they fail to honor God and instead invest inordinate value and loyalty in some earthly thing. The old-fashioned word for this is idolatry.
Think of all the ways our idols have been revealed in the past few months. For example, I love to watch sports on television, curled up on the couch before a large and well-defined screen. That’s gone, and I wonder if it is all bad. There is more time for my family and community. Some great books are now getting my attention. Walks with my wife are more frequent.
Or consider how many of us were getting accustomed to long-distance travel. Now we are getting to know our own towns and local communities better.
It’s not that I want a world without sports and travel, but we might ask ourselves if they had become selfish preoccupations, obscuring neighbors and others in need.
Second, the virus unmasks the great myth of self-sufficiency. People of faith should know that the community is prior to the individual. We Americans love to celebrate all things centered on the self. But let’s face it: About the only thing we truly do alone is die.
The stories of courage and self-sacrifice coming from our hospitals and nursing homes are reminders of our dependence on a host of people and institutions. The long car lines outside food shelves point to the many in our midst who are perilously close to poverty. And consider our basic need to trust others to wear masks, wash hands and keep a distance in order to prevent the virus from spreading.
Seldom has it been more evident that our own well-being rests in the hands of others and that many in our midst are hurting.
Third, the pandemic calls into question something I would term “nature mysticism.” People of faith are wary of confusing creation with the Creator. In our day there seems to be an increasing tendency to turn to the natural world for meaning and purpose in life. Often this grows sentimental, as the phrase “nature bathing” suggests. The earth becomes the cleansing source of life itself, possessing the power and strength to make us “whole.”
Now, I enjoy the outdoors as much as anyone and long for the days when campgrounds and parks are fully open. But the pandemic reveals what we all intuitively know: Nature has its shadow side. The deadly virus is nature at its darkest. The message here is that nature needs to be cared for and respected. It is a source of awe and beauty. But it isn’t God.
C.S. Lewis once said that pain and suffering are God’s megaphone to a deaf world. If he is right, then God has not been silent during the pandemic. Pain and suffering also raise huge questions, of course, about God’s justice. That’s fair, and faith can provide insights on that as well.
But my primary concern here is to deflect some attention away from the fringe response to the virus and point instead to the ways God might be interrupting our lives and asking us to stop and think. I believe God is speaking. Are we listening?"
"May 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/cities-towns-must-not-be-left-out-of-emergency-relief/570518852/,StarTribune,"Cities, towns must not be left out of emergency relief.","During a crisis, cooperation among all levels of government — local, state, and federal — is essential for the well-being of our nation’s residents. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to take a toll on the nation’s health and economy, city governments are in desperate need of federal assistance to address budget shortfalls and mounting costs related to COVID-19.
Without that assistance, cities in Minnesota and across the country will have little choice but to reduce core city services due to plummeting revenue. City governments employ essential workers who are responsible for the health and safety of our communities — police officers, emergency medical technicians, firefighters, sanitation workers. City service reductions can mean slower response times when emergencies occur and add further burden to the workloads of remaining public safety staff at a time when residents have perhaps the greatest need.
City officials in Minnesota appreciate the leadership, to date, shown by our partners at the state and federal levels in promoting the health and safety of our residents while working to mitigate the effects of a slumping economy. For example, the federal government has administered multiple stimulus packages providing short-term relief to businesses that have temporarily shuttered and to individuals who have lost jobs.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of our nation’s cities and towns — including the 853 cities in Minnesota — have been left out. Like many businesses, cities in our state employ thousands of workers who serve essential roles in our way of life. Funds that can be used to address current and future city revenue shortfalls, and to help cover the cost of those essential workers, have yet to be allocated in a direct federal response package.
About 80% of our nation’s population resides in cities and suburban areas. Yet only municipalities with populations exceeding 500,000 (a total of 36 U.S. cities) were eligible for aid under the federal government’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act signed into law in March.
None of Minnesota’s 853 cities meet that population threshold for eligibility.
In our state, the vast majority of cities have populations of less than 5,000 people. A fair and direct allocation of federal funds to every city, regardless of size, is necessary to replace lost revenue. A recent story in the Star Tribune noted that “Cities are losing taxes as businesses shut down, and they expect more losses from property tax delinquencies and nonpayments. Licensing and permit fee revenue are down along with user fee payments for shuttered parks, pools and recreation centers.”
We are hearing such stories from city officials throughout the state, and we are still in the early stages of this crisis. Cities are operating at the front lines during the pandemic, and municipal budgets are hanging on by a thread. Without federal investment in local governments soon, our communities will be less safe, less healthy, less prosperous.
The League of Minnesota Cities — the state’s largest municipal membership association — echoes a call made earlier this month to Congress from the National League of Cities for $500 billion in federal aid over the next two years to help cities and counties, regardless of size. As National League of Cities president Joe Buscaino notes, “This not a request for a handout, nor a call for a federal bailout — this is the extension of a partnership, a critical state-local-federal bond that we seek in order to rebuild and restore our great nation.”
The League of Minnesota Cities urges our state’s eight members of the U.S. House and its two U.S. senators to honor the partnership, and to support a bipartisan solution to remedy city financial challenges."
"May 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/with-demand-in-the-dumps-north-dakota-oil-fields-grow-quiet/570515752/,StarTribune,"With demand in the dumps, North Dakota oil fields grow quiet","With production and employment falling rapidly, North Dakota’s oil industry is enduring historically bleak times.
The number of drilling rigs in North Dakota — a harbinger for future oil production — is at a low not seen in the fracking era, said Lynn Helms, director of the state’s Mineral Resources Department, in a conference call with reporters Friday.
The rig count, which was in the 50s during the first three months of this year, fell to 35 in April and sits at 12 today — “a massive decline,” Helms said. It’s expected to drop below 10, he added.
Drilling new wells is a major source of employment in North Dakota’s oil industry, and so is fracking, the injection of torrents of water, sand and chemicals into those wells. There were 25 frac crews operating in North Dakota in March. Today, there is one.
“That is not a pretty picture,” Helms said.
Jobless claims in North Dakota’s oil patch have been disproportionately much higher than for the state as a whole.
As of the week of May 9, 7,633 workers in the petroleum and mining industry had filed for unemployment benefits — 36% of that sector’s average workforce in 2019, according to data from North Dakota Job Service.
Most oil and mining sector unemployment claims come from oil field workers. Petroleum job classification doesn’t include thousands more workers who depend on the oil and gas industry.
There were scraps of good news in the state’s monthly report Thursday, Helms said.
At 1.43 million barrels per day, North Dakota’s March oil production fell only 2% from February, even though the global oil cave-in started that month.
Helms also noted that with oil prices creeping up over the past week, he has heard reports that some operators may resume production at wells currently shut-in because of the crisis.
Still, with oil storage tanks brimming, there’s little place for new production to go without a significant hike in demand, which isn’t forecast anytime soon. Any semblance of a true recovery in North Dakota’s oil output is months away, Helms said.
The state is forecasting production in the “950,000 [barrels per day] range” in April, he said, a 33% decline from March and the lowest since 2016.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark U.S. oil price, was around $60 a barrel in early January but began plummeting in March and briefly fell below zero in late April. Oil has been crushed by a supply glut and a coronavirus-induced collapse in fuel demand.
On Friday, WTI was trading just below $30 a barrel, up $10 from the beginning of May. But that price is still well below break-even for oil producers.
North Dakota, home to the Bakken oil fields, is the nation’s largest petroleum-producing state after Texas. Oil and gas is one of its two bedrock industries, along with agriculture.
The petroleum business provides North Dakota with its largest pot of tax money. The industry was forecast to generate $4.9 billion from July 1 through June 30, 2021 — 57% of all revenue collected by the state.
Earlier this month, North Dakota created a “Bakken Restart Task Force,” made up of multiple government agencies. It aims to spur a recovery of the state’s oil and gas industry through regulatory and tax “relief,” low-cost financing and other measures.
“There is a lot of brainstorming going on,” Helms said."
"May 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/unknown-infection-sources-key-to-virus-fate-in-minnesota/570516842/,StarTribune,Unknown infection sources key to COVID-19 future in Minnesota,"After five days in Bethesda Hospital, Ronald Buhrt returned to his apartment and wife in Cottage Grove — fully recovered from his COVID-19 respiratory illness, but with a nagging question.
How the heck did he get infected?
“I have no idea, “ said Buhrt, 79. “I had shopped some for food and I had been at the drugstore a few times, but basically I wasn’t out all that much.”
Solving such mystery infections could be a key to Minnesota’s battle with the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as Gov. Tim Walz and state leaders dial back social distancing mandates and rely more on contact tracing investigations to identify outbreaks in families, communities and businesses before they spread.
A new state “dial back” dashboard showed Friday that 36% of COVID-19 cases involved people with unknown infection sources in their communities. That is higher than the state goal of 30%, and health officials said a continued rate above that could be grounds for new restrictions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Whether 30% is the appropriate threshold, the state must do a better job at identifying the sources of COVID-19 infections so that it can spot developing outbreaks and protect others at risk, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist.
“When we come across cases that don’t have a contact, it tells us that the virus is circulating and that it means perhaps there is a higher level” of cases than is known, she said.
The state also sent a health alert to doctors Friday to begin to track cases of an illness among children that might be linked to COVID-19. Following reports of cases in Europe — and as many as 100 cases and three deaths in children in New York — the Minnesota Department of Health asked doctors to report any possible cases of the condition, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.
“We are just trying to figure out what is going on here now that people are observing this,” Lynfield said.
Some of these pediatric cases have occurred weeks after children suffered infections with the COVID-19 virus. Most children recover, but some of the cases mimic toxic shock syndrome and can cause rashes, digestion issues and problems with multiple organs, Lynfield said.
Whether there is a link to COVID-19 is unclear. So far, the pandemic has been harsher on the elderly and people with underlying health problems — who make up around 98% of the 683 deaths related to COVID-19 in Minnesota so far.
The state on Friday also reported a single-day record of 808 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases, bringing the known case total to 14,240. Only 939 lab-confirmed cases involved Minnesotans 19 or younger. The youngest death so far has been someone who was 30.
In cases in which an exposure has been determined, living in long-term care remains the most likely cause of infection. That was the exposure source for 2,659 cases.
While 2,299 cases involved known sources in communities, such as spouses or co-workers, another 2,151 community cases had no known infection sources.
“When we hear about someone who says, ‘I don’t know, I just went to the grocery store and I don’t know of any other exposure,’ that’s significant,” said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.
Modeling by state health and University of Minnesota researchers assumed as many as 41% of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and people might be spreading the virus without knowing it.
As a result, the latest modeling this week predicted 1,441 deaths by the end of May under a scenario by which the statewide stay-at-home order ended on Monday. The modeling also predicted a surge of cases by June 29 because of the decline in restrictions and the increase in face-to-face disease transmission that could use up the state’s supply of hospital intensive care beds and ventilators.
Walz said Minnesotans must remain cautious now that he is ending the stay-at-home order and replacing it with a new “Stay Safe MN” strategy that allows most retailers to reopen Monday with social distancing plans in place.
Group gatherings of no more than 10 people will be permitted as well. Bars, restaurants and hair salons and other service businesses will remain closed until at least June 1.
“I don’t think we should be naive to believe that we are out of this thing,” Walz said on Friday, adding that he wouldn’t hesitate to resume restrictions if hospitals reported being overwhelmed by rising cases of severe illness.
Buhrt said he was scared when his congestion and breathing got so bad that he needed hospital care. His wife tested positive as well, but she didn’t have such severe symptoms. Neither had been out in the community much and had only visited their nearby daughter and grandkids through a car window.
Buhrt had taken to pacing up and down the halls of his apartment complex for exercise. Now back at home from the hospital and under isolation restrictions, he has taken to pacing from the living room to his front door.
A pitcher for the University of Minnesota in the 1960s, Buhrt said his fitness probably helped him weather his illness. He’s resigned to never knowing how he got infected.
“It’s a mystery,” he said.
State health officials are hoping to solve more such mysteries with an infusion of additional contact investigators to rapidly reach out to people who test positive for COVID-19.
They had hoped to increase the staff of investigators to 460 by the end of this week and to even reach out to some people before their test results are back to identify their contacts who may be at risk.
“We do want to bring that measure down” below 30% of cases with unknown transmission, Lynfield said. “We want to be able to control transmission within the community.”
Additional funding for even more interviewers — who may be needed if case numbers surge — is unclear. House lawmakers have advanced a $300 million hiring plan, but a comparable state Senate bill includes only $5 million.
Walz on Friday said he was “a little nervous” that legislative support for this funding and the need for contact tracing was weakening, though he added that he ultimately has authority to earmark funds for that purpose while he still has peacetime emergency powers.
Investigators continue to use a federal threshold that people are at medium risk for infection if they spend 15 minutes within 6 feet of someone carrying the virus, Ehresmann said. However, state interviewers are asked to use judgment.
“If someone with COVID coughs in your face, then the 15 minutes doesn’t matter,” she said.
Investigators originally asked only about contacts of infected people after they experienced their first COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. Now, they ask about contacts 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, because of evidence that people are infectious before they know they are sick."
"May 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/walz-makes-worthington-judge-his-first-state-supreme-court-selection/570504402/,StarTribune,Gov. Walz makes Worthington judge his first Minnesota Supreme Court selection,"Gov. Tim Walz on Friday went outside of the metro legal community to make a Worthington judge his first state Supreme Court appointee.
Nobles County District Judge Gordon Moore, also a former top prosecutor in the southwest Minnesota community, will likely be the only Supreme Court selection of Walz’s current term. He will replace the retiring Justice David Lillehaug, who steps down July 31.
Lillehaug, a former U.S. attorney appointed to the Supreme Court in 2013, announced plans to retire last year following a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis.
Asked about replacing one white male jurist with another, the governor said the selection of Moore would inject geographic diversity into the Supreme Court.
“I think the question on diversity on the courts is one that’s always there and plays into our decision, but not in its totality,” Walz said. “This was the right pick and I feel confident that Judge Moore brings that unique perspective and in this case it is a perspective of living in greater Minnesota for the last quarter-century.”
Interviews for the post were conducted this spring by a panel made up of members of the Commission on Judicial Selection and key Walz administration staff, including the state’s chief inclusion officer.
Moore, 57, grew up in Rochester and lived in Northfield and Mankato before moving to Worthington to raise a family in 1995. Before becoming Nobles County attorney, Moore served as a special assistant and assistant attorney general under state Attorney General Skip Humphrey and was an associate and assistant city attorney in Worthington.
Moore spoke Friday of his experience in southwest Minnesota, particularly the increasingly diverse city of Worthington. He acknowledged that the rural community “has frankly had some difficulty recently,” but added, “we’ll rise up and we’ll solve this and we’ll get beyond this.”
“The Worthington story is really a microcosm of the bigger story that our state is undergoing,” Moore said. “The transformation of Worthington over the past 25 years has just been extraordinary. We are one of the most diverse communities in the state and we pride ourselves on that.”
Moore was picked from a field of four finalists that also included Court of Appeals Judges Diane Bratvold and Jeffrey Bryan and Chief Deputy Attorney General John Keller.
Lola Velazquez-Aguilu, chair of the state Commission on Judicial Selection, praised Moore’s experience as a jurist in a greater Minnesota courtroom serving a population where as many as 18 different languages are spoken.
“Everybody talked about the fact that Judge Moore brings a really profound cultural competence to the courtroom,” said Velazquez-Aguilu, describing letters of recommendation from local legal groups, interpreters and defense attorneys. “He finds a way to make everyone feel like they can understand the process and that the process is accessible to them no matter the barriers.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie Skjerven Gildea called Moore’s selection “an excellent appointment.”
“Judge Moore brings a passion for the law and has demonstrated a deep commitment to the judiciary and to serving the public,” Gildea said. She also praised Lillehaug, calling him a “wonderful colleague who has greatly enriched our decisionmaking.”
Peter Knapp, interim president and dean of Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said Moore’s experience as a judge in greater Minnesota would have forced him to become adept at overseeing a wide swath of cases. That experience should aid the Supreme Court as it navigates the administration of justice amid the coronavirus pandemic, Knapp said.
“Bringing someone in with that kind of experience to the court at this moment in history I think is very important,” said Knapp, a scholar who has closely watched the Supreme Court.
John Tunheim, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, hired Moore out of law school to join the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office. A Thief River Falls native, Tunheim welcomed news of a non-metro addition to the Supreme Court on Friday.
“I like the fact that he brings a district court judge’s perspective to the Supreme Court and I think it’s important that he spent much of his career in greater Minnesota,” Tunheim said. “I think that’s a perspective that’s needed on the court, and he’ll be a terrific jurist.”"
"May 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/for-minn-businesses-left-in-limbo-june-1-is-the-next-date/570513202/,StarTribune,"For the businesses Walz left in limbo, June 1 is the next date","Penelope Burau felt whipsawed once again.
Her hair salon, closed since March 17, will stay shuttered at least another two weeks as Minnesotans fight the coronavirus pandemic.
This week was the third time she’d felt ready to get back to work, only to have Gov. Tim Walz decide that businesses like hers that involve close contact should stay closed awhile longer.
“This is something I never thought I’d have to navigate,” said Burau, a stylist for Salon Concepts in Chanhassen. “To be forced not to have an income, to be without anything, is pretty devastating.”
Walz on Wednesday gave the green light for most retailers to reopen Monday at 50% capacity. But hands-on businesses such as hair salons, barber shops and fitness centers will remain sidelined until at least June 1. Gathering spots like movie theaters, bowling alleys, bars and restaurants also have to wait.
Roughly nine in 10 Minnesota workers soon will be back on the job as restrictions ease, according to state officials, but the hammer continues to fall unevenly on the rest.
Burau, with a daughter about to graduate from high school, waited more than seven weeks before getting her first two weeks of unemployment insurance and the $1,200 stimulus check from the Treasury Department.
“We’re basically eating what’s already in the house,” she said. “I go from being self-sufficient and self-employed to being desperate for work. It’s been a weekly nightmare.”
John Schultz, who with wife, Kelsey, owns two Anytime Fitness gyms in the St. Cloud area, greeted Walz’s announcement on Wednesday with relief.
“At least we have light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
The Schultzes furloughed 14 employees and froze membership dues for 2,000 members. They turned an annual practice they call “fear setting” — in which they plan for the worst-case scenario — into an every-other-week conversation.
“The easy part is preparing the space,” Schultz said. “The tough part is figuring out what the market’s going to be and what the business will look like.”
Government loan programs meant to offer a safety net proved difficult to navigate, even for Schultz, who once worked for Wells Fargo.
They easily got a Small Business Administration grant for the club in Sauk Rapids, where their efforts to build a yoga and personal trainer program from scratch were starting to pay off. But they had no luck getting economic relief for the Anytime Fitness in neighboring Sartell, because it had been open less than a year.
The couple plans to re-engineer some of the fitness classes and add more virtual ones. They’re also exploring potential new revenue lines, such as meal plans, supplements and nutritional coaching.
“The businesses that will survive are the ones prepared to reinvent and respond to the market as it develops,” Kelsey Schultz said.
Jeremy Mathison, a founder and operations manager of Broken Clock Brewing in Minneapolis, regards a potential June 1 opening with equal measures of optimism and caution.
“While that’s exciting, and we’re eager,” he said, “we’re hesitant assuming people will all of a sudden come back to congregate in bars and restaurants, even at 50 percent capacity.”
Broken Clock, a cooperative with about 970 members, has added a 4,000-square-foot taproom and had planned to mark its three-year anniversary this weekend during the crowd-filled Art-A-Whirl festival, which this year will be an online-only affair.
“Just as we were starting to get our year-over-year numbers and starting to see substantial growth, we got hit with this,” Mathison said.
Broken Clock brews in small enough batches that it hasn’t had to resort to dumping, as have some craft brewers. With the help of a Paycheck Protection Program grant, it brought back eight of its 11 employees to help fill orders for growlers.
But Mathison knows that loans and grants aren’t a long-term solution.
“As breweries, we’re all fighting to get back open and welcome and celebrate our communities. That’s the whole reason breweries exist,” Mathison said. “We’re anxious to get there but we understand that people come first.”
Burau, the out-of-work stylist, fears she may never crawl out of the financial hole.
She applied for a loan from Women Venture that didn’t come through, and ended up borrowing against her retirement savings.
She took a part-time job at Target.
“Having that temporary job has helped not to completely deplete everything I’ve saved,” she said, “but it’s not paying my bills either.”
Though disappointed she’ll have to wait to reopen, demand for her services hasn’t waned.
Burau said she’d heard from 243 customers by Thursday. “All want to be ‘done’ on June 1,” she added.
Now she’s praying for patience."

His criticism comes as Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, faces an FBI probe over a large sale of stock in mid-February as he was receiving classified briefings about the coronavirus threat.
In financial disclosure forms required by the Senate, Smith disclosed March 17 the sale of stock her husband owned in two companies. The amounts in both transactions were listed in ranges of $250,001 to $500,000. The two firms, Dexcom Inc. and Insulet Corp., manufacture devices or systems for diabetes management.
Lewis questioned “what sensitive information Smith may have received in her role as senator.”
Smith campaign spokesman Ed Shelleby said it was her husband, Archie Smith, who owned the stocks and decided to sell them. Smith owns no stocks, he said; her husband is a medical device firms investor.
Calling the sales a “simple business decision,” Shelleby noted that by March 17, the stock market had hit days of historic lows, and wide swaths of society were already closing down due to the pandemic.
Shelleby also noted that Lewis himself, in a March 8 radio interview, predicted widespread stock sell-offs in response to the pandemic."
"May 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/a-split-israel-swears-in-two-party-government/570548542/,StarTribune,A split Israel swears in two-party government,"JERUSALEM – Ending a 510-day political crisis that three elections had failed to resolve, Israel on Sunday swore in a new government charged with responding to the coronavirus pandemic, extending Prime Minister Benjamin Netan­yahu's record-setting tenure just a week before his corruption trial is set to begin.
Netanyahu, 70, has joined forces with his challenger, centrist former army chief Benny Gantz, 60, who now holds the new title of ""alternate prime minister,"" and veto power over most major decisions, control over half the government's ministries and an agreement to switch positions with Netanyahu on Nov. 17, 2021.
But by keeping Netanyahu in office, even as he faces prosecution on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges over his dealings with wealthy media executives, the new ruling coalition may represent a crowning political achievement for Israel's longest-serving leader.
Only 2 ½ years ago, Netanyahu's closest allies had ruled out the possibility that he could continue in office if he were indicted. Only 2 ½ months ago, a clear majority of Israeli voters had elected lawmakers promising to usher Netanyahu into the political afterlife.
Yet in a matter of weeks, Netanyahu transformed those adversaries into political footnotes.
Gantz's Blue and White party broke apart over his decision to join Netanyahu, the once-dominant Labor party was reduced to two seats in parliament and Arab lawmakers who had sought greater influence than ever over Israeli public life found themselves again on the margins.
Gantz's acceptance of an IOU from Netanyahu could prove foolhardy: Few analysts say they believe that their agreement will survive long enough for Gantz to take his turn as prime minister.
The opposition now lacks coherence. The center-left parties that backed Gantz were joined by Yamina, a right-wing party led by Naftali Bennett, a former defense minister.
Israel's long political stalemate, dating from December 2018, had kept the government in limbo, unable to pass major legislation or enact a new spending plan reflecting changing national priorities.
Netanyahu promised to deliver a new budget ""that will prevent the economy from collapsing, that will guarantee stability, that will restore growth — a budget that will give you, citizens of Israel, hope, and a horizon, by restoring three things: jobs, jobs, jobs."""
"May 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/fed-chairman-jerome-powell-warns-recovery-likely-to-stretch-through-2021/570578892/,StarTribune,Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warns recovery likely to stretch through 2021,"Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said that the United States would have a slow recovery from what he called the ""biggest shock that the economy's had in living memory,"" suggesting that a full rebound from virus-induced lockdowns could take until the end of 2021.
In an interview on ""60 Minutes,"" the CBS program, Powell reiterated that both Congress and the central bank may need to do more to help workers and businesses make it through the sudden and sharp slump caused by efforts to contain the coronavirus.
""This economy will recover; it may take a while,"" Powell said. ""It may take a period of time, it could stretch through the end of next year, we really don't know.""
The Fed has rushed to insulate the economy as coronavirus lockdowns caused business activity to come to near standstill, leaving more than 20 million people jobless. But it remains an open question whether the central bank's actions will be sufficient if it takes a long time for the economy to fully reopen, leaving businesses short on income for an extended period and increasing the risk that many will close.
Powell has begun warning that lawmakers and the White House may need to do more to support households and businesses if the virus persists.
In his ""60 Minutes"" appearance, broadcast and streamed into millions of American homes, Powell reiterated that shepherding the economy through the darkest days of the coronavirus lockdown may require more policy action and suggested the recovery would not be seamless. Asked whether the economy could heal without an effective vaccine, Powell suggested that activity could restart before a treatment became available without making a complete rebound.
""Assuming that there's not a second wave of the coronavirus, I think you'll see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year,"" he said. ""For the economy to fully recover, people will have to be fully confident, and that may have to await the arrival of a vaccine.""
Powell pointed specifically to parts of the economy where people are in close contact — such as live events — as areas that might struggle to pick up before better protection is available.
The Fed chairman suggested that the worst economic readings were yet to come, even as states begin to gradually reopen. He said that he expected ""a couple more months"" of job losses and acknowledged that the unemployment rate, which hit 14.7% in April, could peak at 20% or even 25%. He said that as the economy contracts in the second quarter, it could ""easily"" fall by 20% or 30% on an annual basis.
Powell suggested that appropriate government policy could ""buy time"" for workers and companies, and that government efforts may need to span ""maybe three or six more months.""
""It may well be that the Fed has to do more,"" he said. ""It may be that Congress has to do more. And the reason we've got to do more is to avoid longer-run damage to the economy."""

But eventually, California’s Gilead Sciences will start charging Americans for remdesivir, the drug that recently became the only therapeutic agent shown to cut down the recovery from COVID-19.
Analysts and leaders of health care foundations say the price for a 10-day intravenous course of the drug should fall somewhere between $1 and $4,500. For now, Gilead is focusing public attention on its $1 billion investment to scale up manufacturing, rather than calculating the drug’s monetary value to humanity.
Like states across the country, Minnesota received its first small shipment of the novel antiviral donated by Gilead on May 9. A second batch arrived in Minnesota on Saturday. Together, the shipments contained enough vials of remdesivir for about 254 courses if taken for the full 10 days. The supply could be stretched farther if some patients qualify for 5-day courses.
As happened elsewhere, Minnesota public health officials intervened before the state’s first shipment so that the donated drug didn’t go directly to a hospital, Minnesota Health Department (MDH) Epidemiologist Dr. Ruth Lynfield confirmed in an e-mail Sunday.
“Things were occurring quickly and they [federal health officials] notified us that they looked at data to define hot spots and were going to send a shipment to a hospital in Minnesota,” Lynfield said. “I asked if they could send that shipment to MDH instead and we would allocate, because I knew we had access to the number of COVID infected patients in facilities across Minnesota.”
A series of discussions soon followed with infectious disease experts, doctors who treat critically ill patients, and members of the Minnesota COVID-19 Ethics Collaborative to develop an action plan to allocate the drug before the time the first shipment.
The debate is playing out as coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase across the state.
As of Sunday, 221 people were in hospital intensive-care units for COVID-19, and another 266 were in normal hospital beds for it. Minnesota has diagnosed 15,668 cases of COVID-19 and 722 deaths.
Despite all the action, remdesivir is still an experimental drug, and the price for it far is from the only looming question.
The drug was first developed as an antiviral that could treat diseases including Ebola. It’s intended to work by disrupting how the virus creates genetic copies of itself, stopping the virus from rapidly multiplying.
In a federally run clinical trial involving 1,063 patients — including 32 enrolled at the University of Minnesota — the drug showed enough promise that scientists overseeing the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) trial ended the experiment early because it no longer seemed ethical to randomize people to a group that didn’t get the drug.
The Food and Drug Administration authorized its distribution nationwide a few days later.
All patients in the trial were in the hospital and were receiving supplemental oxygen. It’s not known whether the drug could be effective in less-severe cases.
People who got the real drug spent a median of 11 days in the hospital, vs. 15 days for those got a placebo, when neither patient nor doctor knew whether a placebo was used.
“It’s the only drug that has really been show to have some effectiveness in a randomized trial against a placebo, which is considered the gold standard,” said Dr. Peter Bornstein, an infectious disease physician and partner with private practice St. Paul Infectious Disease Associates.
No one knows yet whether remdesivir can reduce the chances of death from COVID-19.
The National Institutes of Health published a statement April 29 saying the trial data suggested a survival benefit, but was not conclusive. About 8% of the patients who got remdesivir died, vs. 11.6% with placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant.
Dr. Susan Kline, infectious disease physician and site principal investigator at the University of Minnesota, said a second phase of the study has already gotten underway. In that study, everyone is getting remdesivir, while some will also be randomized to get a second drug called baricitinib, normally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Kline said.
Minnesotans do not need to be in a clinical trial to get remdesivir. Thanks to the couple-hundred doses donated to Minnesota, the drug is also available in hospitals. At least more weekly shipments are expected.
Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’Day has said the company is donating all of its 1.5 million existing vials of the drug to health authorities worldwide. O’Day said much of the supply would have gone to clinical trials where patients wouldn’t have been charged anyway.
“We are donating our entire existing supply, frankly because this is the right thing to do at this time,” O’Day told investors April 30, adding later, “Gilead will focus on making remdesivir both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world.”
When an analyst from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey asked O’Day whether Gilead plans to generate a profit margin despite saying the drug would be “affordable,” O’Day assuaged her concerns:
“Trust us,” O’Day said. “We deeply respect and appreciate the fact that when we get into millions of doses, we have to have a sustainable economic model that works here and that achieves access to affordability to patients around the world.”
Earlier this month Gilead said it was in discussions to license production for Europe, Asia and developing countries through 2022. Generic drugmakers could also make the drug for developing countries under long-term licenses. Gilead was in “advanced discussions” with United Nations child-health agency UNICEF about providing drugs in low- and middle-income nations through good distribution networks.
The L.A.-based not-for-profit AIDS Healthcare Foundation said Gilead should sell remdesivir for no more than $1 per dose. AHF President Michael Weinstein said in a statement the group’s demand was based partly on Gilead’s “abysmal” record with lifesaving treatments for HIV and hepatitis C.
In 2018, Bloomberg News reported that Gilead’s high prices for hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Epclusa sparked widespread debate over drug prices, after initially being priced at $94,500 and $74,760 per drug course.
A research paper in the Journal of Virus Eradication last month estimated remdesivir could be sold for 93 cents per day (or $9.27 per 10-day course) and generate a 10% profit margin after taking out costs and taxes.
Another organization called ICER — the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review in Boston — said if the price of the drug were based on a traditional cost-effectiveness calculation that included quality-of-life and the costs of other therapies, the 10-day price would be $4,500.
“Public and policymakers should be actively debating how to link pricing to an overall platform to develop treatments for COVID-19,” ICER said."

The Minneapolis-based health plan said Tuesday it is discounting premiums by 20% for the months of July and August while eliminating copays for Medicare primary care and mental health clinic services during the COVID-19 public health emergency.
Premium discounts at UCare also apply to about 40,000 people who buy individual health plans from the insurer.
Eagan-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota announced Monday it would eliminate certain fees when Medicare Advantage subscribers seek health care. Minnetonka-based UnitedHealthcare said earlier this month it would remove cost-sharing fees in Medicare Advantage plans through the end of September.
""We are concerned that our members — including older and more vulnerable members — are forgoing needed care at this time,"" Mark Traynor, the UCare chief executive, said in a statement. ""We want members to access essential care, and we are pleased to enhance providers' ability to provide that care.""
Hospitals and outpatient treatment centers across Minnesota canceled elective surgeries beginning in mid-March to conserve resources for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients, and only recently have begun resuming the procedures. In addition, some patients have opted to cancel or delay care due to concerns about being exposed to the novel coronavirus, according to an April survey conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota's State Health Access Data Assistance Center.
The survey found that 58.7% of U.S. adults said the pandemic hindered their access to health care services, either by way of personal decisions on seeking care or cancellations by health care providers. Roughly one-fifth of those surveyed said they postponed scheduling a health care appointment due to concerns about exposure to the coronavirus, according to the report, which found exposure concerns prompted some to cancel appointments, as well.
Like other health insurers, UCare previously announced it would waive copay, coinsurance and deductibles for COVID-19 testing and hospital care. The insurer said Tuesday that those policies are continuing.
UCare said it's also providing $25,000 grants to small health care providers and community clinics ""to build infrastructure during COVID-19."""
"May 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/jason-lewis-gop-isn-t-what-it-once-was-good-riddance/570606762/,StarTribune,Jason Lewis: GOP isn't what it once was. Good riddance.,"Talk about having your finger on the pulse.
In 2008, Sen. John McCain marched out of St. Paul and the Republican National Convention as the GOP’s presidential nominee — and promptly lost Minnesota by 300,000 votes.
The senator from Arizona was followed in 2012 by Mitt Romney running on his private-equity platform. He lost our state by 226,000.
The swamp calls this progress.
In comes Donald Trump in 2016, with little money and no paid staff on the ground, and he nearly pulls off an amazing upset, losing Minnesota by just 44,000 votes or 1.5% — the closest margin for a Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1984.
Yet none of this stops Minnesota’s own clique of never-Trumpers from their tiresome attacks (“Minnesota Republicans, what are you going to do?” May 15) on the president and those Republicans who dare to back him — who appear to be quite numerous. Indeed, Trump has by far the highest approval ratings among Republicans since Reagan.
For practical purposes, David Durenberger hasn’t been a Republican for some time, and Tom Horner literally left the party long ago. But that hasn’t stopped the media — in particular the Star Tribune — from treating them as grand old patrons of the Grand Old Party.
Their criticisms, however, ring as hollow as their brethren on cable news spewing the most vile invective at Trump Republicans. It’s easy to see why — their cozy world of inside baseball has crumbled faster than the national pastime under the police-state national lockdown they admire.
The fat-cat public relations contracts political mercenaries have fed off are gone, replaced by a Republican Party that’s representing the working class at the expense of the carried-interest crowd. And by a president who eschews unilateral disarmament in favor of fighting back.
That’s what really explains the inscrutable hysteria from a few establishment Republicans who joined Democrats in trying to remove a duly elected president from office on charges they knew to be false. It betrays a particular kind of rank pettiness coming from 11th Commandment has-beens who lectured conservatives on how they needed to circle the wagons around Messrs. McCain and Romney.
Make no mistake, these are the folks who backed Republicans only when party leaders weren’t interested in getting tough on China, securing the border or putting America first. These are globalists backing industry bailouts along with open borders and the welfare state. Yet now they rail against Minnesotans who know they will never get the freedom and prosperity they deserve from anyone espousing green new deals at the expense of the Iron Range or from former senators who could never quite gather enough votes for single-payer insurance.
It won’t matter. The realignment is already too far along to stop Minnesota from turning red. Democrats may never let a crisis go to waste, but their credibility has taken a massive hit.
From Russian and Ukrainian impeachment hoaxes to Michael Avenatti to defaming Covington high schoolers and Brett Kavanaugh. And now they and their dwindling band of political miscreants are backing former Vice President Joe Biden — “personal flaws” and all.
No doubt Durenberger and Horner will also support Democratic incumbent Tina Smith in this year’s Senate race, along with all the politically correct CEOs and their big corporate PACs pouring beltway cash into my opponent’s coffers. In fact, Smith has already taken tens of thousands of dollars from companies outsourcing jobs to China while selling the family’s stock during a coronavirus crash.
These folks are giving hypocrisy a bad name, yet a day doesn’t go by where the media doesn’t eagerly promote some never-Trumper’s last ditch and desperate attempt at relevance.
Are we really to believe the “ethical and moral roots” of two pro-abortion rights advocates attacking Republicans while refusing to mention a Democratic Party that’s all in on what Daniel Patrick Moynihan once called infanticide?
Or candidate Biden promising Beto O’Rourke “will be the one who leads” gun-control efforts in order to “save lives?”
Why, “hell yes.”
When I was a kid visiting my grandparents in north Minneapolis, I’d ask them for a dime, walk a block from their apartment on the second story of a neighborhood house and head down to the five-and-dime on Dupont and Broadway for hot chocolate on a cold winter’s day. My maternal grandparents didn’t have money, but they had a safe neighborhood.
But for far too many residents, the “good life in Minnesota” has faded faster than the credibility of the magazine that coined the phrase.
The primary reason for today’s polarization is clear: the Democrat Party has shifted so far to the left as to be unrecognizable to average voters. A recent Pew Research Center study reveals this leftward lurch which explains much of the partisan gap in public opinion.
Perhaps the “resistance” Democrat drift is why so many of the malcontents are lashing out these days. But I suspect another reason is that the GOP is finally showing these impostors the door and they know it.
Here’s hoping it doesn’t hit them on their way out."
"May 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/as-businesses-reopen-consumers-have-some-questions/570606692/,StarTribune,"As businesses reopen, consumers have some questions","Starting this week, businesses across Minnesota could well be judged by a whole new set of factors — all of which go beyond “did you find everything you were looking for?”
Think:
Is the business clean?
Are the required hand-sanitizing stations in place, accessible and filled?
Are face masks required? Not just suggested, but required?
Welcome to in-person shopping in the era (and likely still early stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Put more simply, one question reflects the new standard: Is patronizing this business in person worth risking my health?
The reality is that with more than 1.4 million adults in Minnesota facing serious health risks if they contract COVID-19, it’s a fair question for consumers to ask. The highly contagious novel coronavirus — which poses serious health risks to about 92.6 million adults nationwide if contracted — already is reshaping behaviors.
Expect more of the same as small and Main Street businesses statewide reopen. And if Minnesota bars, restaurants, salons, gyms and even more businesses open June 1 as proposed, there is no doubt this paradigm shift will continue.
To be clear, the question of consumer safety is not in opposition to Gov. Tim Walz’s decision to allow more businesses to reopen and to let his stay-at-home order expire. Walz is doing an admirable job trying to protect public health while getting Minnesota on track toward its new normal. Witness his administration’s detailed expectations (and suggestions) for helping businesses reopen.
Expecting businesses to craft their own COVID-19 Preparedness Plans (built on a template from the state) essentially forces them to realize how easily — and unintentionally — they could be putting customers at risk.
And it also creates a starting point from which businesses will be judged by consumers on whether the products they offer on site are worth the risks consumers may face upon entering businesses.
Businesses — especially in the retail sector — have long had to properly balance product, price, ambience, convenience and, to a degree, cleanliness to survive. The coronavirus, though, redefines that challenge. New standards of cleanliness are now mandated. Whether and to what degree businesses meet and exceed those standards could easily determine not just whether they survive, but if they thrive.
And making that collective decision starting this week will be scores of Minnesotans — all of whom have different health statuses, varying income levels and myriad needs and expectations for shopping in-person during a COVID-19 pandemic.
Amid all that, we wish the best of luck to all reopening businesses. After two months of closure, it would be nice to see every one of them succeed. But free market principles dictate that won’t happen. Instead, it will be consumers who decide which businesses have the right balance of products, prices, convenience and — now — COVID-19 protections.
As always — and as it should be — their votes will be seen in their behaviors and their spending habits."
"May 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/don-t-let-the-search-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-distract-us/570641692/,StarTribune,Don't let the search for a COVID-19 vaccine distract us,"On Friday, President Donald Trump announced “Operation Warp Speed,” a partnership between the government and pharmaceutical companies to develop, manufacture and distribute hundreds of millions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2020. Comparing the effort to the Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bomb, Trump acknowledged that the plan would be “risky and expensive.”
And while the timing may offer hope to those tired of social distancing and help his re-election campaign, the timeline for Operation Warp Speed is likely unrealistically ambitious. There are even questions about the scientific feasibility of making an effective vaccine — not just this year, but in the near future.
While on Monday biotech company Moderna reported promising results from early human trials for one potential coronavirus vaccine, we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that there are miles to go before we have millions of doses of an effective vaccine. The history of large-scale, international efforts to develop and distribute vaccines has produced mixed results. Some, like the polio vaccine and the eradication of smallpox, were quite successful. Many others, despite decades of scientific focus and billions of dollars in investment, were not.
These failures — as well as the relative success of low-tech prevention strategies and drugs that treat virus patients — show the advantages of fighting the pandemic in a balanced way, one that combines the quest to develop a vaccine with efforts more likely to pay off.
Scientists have been trying to make a vaccine for malaria since the late 1960s. Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline has had one candidate in development since 1984, known as RTS,S, that it developed in collaboration with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The research program got a boost in 1999, when the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation launched the Malaria Vaccine Initiative with a $50 million grant.
Managed by PATH, a Seattle-based global health nonprofit, the Malaria Vaccine Initiative has partnered with GlaxoSmithKline since 2001 to refine the RTS,S vaccine. Yet, despite this costly push that brought together public and private resources, more than 30 years since its initial development, the vaccine is still less than 40% effective and efficacy has been shown to wane over time.
While many scientists remain optimistic about the prospects of an eventual malaria vaccine, there are many challenges. There are four different species of malaria, each with several different genetic strains. In addition, the malaria parasite goes through distinct life-cycle stages in the course of infecting the human body and reproducing in the bloodstream, so any vaccine would need to be able to target multiple stages of the parasite’s reproduction. This complexity spotlights why vaccines can be so hard to develop — even when there is real urgency and a significant commitment of resources.
Indeed, malaria remains one of the leading causes of death globally, where it is endemic in many low-income countries despite large-scale eradication efforts throughout the 20th century and the availability of low-tech, but effective, preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets that reach too few at-risk people thanks to a lack of resources and long-term community engagement.
It is a similar story with another major global killer, HIV/AIDS, where enormous effort has gone into producing a vaccine over the last 35 years without success. In 1984, when the Human Immunodeficiency Virus was identified as the cause of AIDS, Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler asserted that a vaccine would be ready for clinical trials within two years. In 1997, President Clinton likewise set a national scientific goal of developing an HIV vaccine within 10 years, and upped the NIH budget to create the Vaccine Research Center.
Yet, success has proved elusive. More than 30 vaccine candidates have been through clinical trials at more than 25 sites around the world since 1987 at an estimated cost of $500 million per year, but to this day none has been shown to be effective.
Yet antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV/AIDS have been available since 1987, and as a result of their effectiveness, contracting the virus is no longer a death sentence. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration also approved a daily pill for those at high risk of contracting HIV, known as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, which prevents HIV infection.
Where they are available and made affordable, these drugs, as well as a low-tech solution — condom use — have proved effective at reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, even without a vaccine. But access and affordability have been major barriers, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, leaving millions exposed to the horrors of HIV/AIDS.
Like the effort to develop malaria and HIV vaccines, the boldly titled Operation Warp Speed envisions a public-private partnership between various government agencies, and private pharmaceutical firms. It will be led by former GlaxoSmithKline executive Moncef Slaoui, and four-star general in charge of U.S. Army logistics Gustave Perna.
Historically, such partnerships have sought to produce affordable drugs and vaccines with very small profit margins for the private manufacturer. However, it is unclear whether Trump intends to control the price of a potential COVID-19 vaccine.
Operation Warp Speed comes on top of the Gates Foundation’s own $125 million COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, which is trying to bring together the World Health Organization, national governments and private industry, citing lessons learned from the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
But as the bold proclamations and subsequent failures around malaria and HIV/AIDS demonstrate, global public health has historically suffered from its overconfidence in technological solutions. The relative success of other measures, like insecticide-treated bed nets to fight malaria, condoms to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and drugs to treat it, suggests that investing in a multipronged approach to treatment and prevention will be the best course of action. Too often, while resources have poured into innovative vaccine developments, insufficient funds — and political will — have existed to get these more simple solutions to people needing them the most.
These examples illustrate how a singular focus on developing a COVID-19 vaccine may divert funding away from more robust public health infrastructure and the testing and contact-tracing methods that have long been proven to curb epidemics. Investing in public health infrastructure can help ensure widespread accessibility if and when a vaccine is available. In the meantime, such investment can also help to guarantee that doctors and nurses have access to basic drugs and medical supplies, and that we have sufficient testing and contract-tracing capacity to mitigate the virus’s spread as states start to reopen."
"May 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/pandemic-related-federal-aid-make-it-fast-but-also-make-it-prudent/570641672/,StarTribune,"Pandemic-related federal aid: Make it fast, but also make it prudent","When all is said and done, the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may prove to be the federal government’s greatest fiscal challenge of our lifetime.
Before the virus struck, unemployment was at an all-time low, wages were ticking upward, and economic growth remained strong after a decade of expansion. But instead of taking advantage of a decade of growth to get deficits and the debt under control, lawmakers bypassed spending caps, evaded pay-as-you-go rules, and enacted huge new spending initiatives and a massive tax cut package.
The wasted years and ill-advised actions led the Congressional Budget Office to project annual deficits at or above $1 trillion this year and into the future. And that was before the pandemic hit.
Today’s health and economic crisis finds households and businesses in dire need, and just as in the 2008-09 “Great Recession,” a federal response is required. Yet, with our national debt set to exceed levels not seen since just after World War II, we are not in a strong fiscal position.
The reason to maintain fiscal order during a strong economy is to make room for a robust fiscal response during times of crisis.
Looking back, it’s easy to see how federal funds could have been better allocated to leave Congress with more flexibility to address this new national emergency. However, shoddy budgeting in years past, while frustrating, doesn’t mean we can pull back and leave health care workers, households and businesses to fend for themselves.
The severity of the pandemic and the economic downturn meant we had to funnel federal aid into the economy in a fast but prudent manner. To its credit, Congress has largely done that, up to this point.
The biggest piece of legislation to combat the pandemic thus far, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, was assembled in a matter of weeks. It came with a staggering $1.7 trillion in borrowing, and some expenditures were not perfectly crafted. Nonetheless, most of the funds were appropriately targeted through direct aid to small businesses and in support of specific health care necessities.
The CARES Act had wide bipartisan support. Now, sadly, that bipartisan spirit is eroding. As a result, lawmakers from both parties are beginning to advance policy goals that have little or nothing to do with the COVID-19 response.
For instance, the latest legislative proposal from House Democrats would repeal the cap on state and local tax deductions for 2020 and 2021. A large majority of this tax break would actually go to households with incomes of $1 million or more. This tax proposal does nothing to address the health crisis or assist families most in need.
On the Republican side, the Trump administration has advocated $2 trillion in deficit financed infrastructure spending. Many roads and bridges across America are clearly in need of repair. Fixing them, though, doesn’t help address the current health or economic crisis.
As with previous national emergencies, government borrowing is unavoidable. But especially in circumstances such as this, the borrowing must be purposeful and should adhere to these principles: timely, targeted and temporary.
Superfluous borrowing today will do more harm than good in the long run by increasing the odds that our outsized national debt will deter future economic growth. Once the pandemic is behind us and economic growth returns, we also need to demand that our leaders make fiscal decisions that leave us better prepared for the next crisis."

When we emerge from social distancing and return to our normal lives, we may find that some rights and protections we had taken for granted have vanished while no one was looking.
One such protection that is now under threat is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In January 2020, the administration proposed to dramatically curtail the input that communities like mine can provide for federal construction projects through NEPA — and now, Trump’s appointees are hard at work to finalize this terrible proposal. Before NEPA existed, federal infrastructure dollars were used to bulldoze and evict communities of color and low-income families in cities across the country and to erect literal barriers to jobs and economic opportunity without any input from affected citizens. My community of Rondo in St. Paul was one of them.
My community was a vibrant black community that sprang up during the Great Migration of African-Americans fleeing the Jim Crow South. By the 1930s, half of St. Paul’s black population lived in Rondo. It then became an oasis of working and middle-class families — one of the most dynamic black communities west of the Mississippi River. It was a railroad town that was unionized thanks to the Pullman porters. It was an intellectually curious town and a black haven, the Rondo we created.
Then that freeway, Interstate 94, came through and wiped us out.
Thanks to redlining and other racist policies in this country, we lacked political power — and more important, because NEPA and its regulations were not yet in existence, we lacked legal recourse to challenge the route of the freeway.
When the highway came through, it was not just the tangible loss — the homes that were razed and the businesses that had to close up shop. Intangible things were lost, too. That you could use the asset of a home to put your kids through school, to have economic security to pass on to your children. It was the dream of homeownership in America back in the 1950s — that is what was bulldozed away from us. It felt like an amputation.
The worst part? There was another viable route for the highway, called the northern route. Decades after the highway was built, we worked with honors students at Macalester College in St. Paul to take a closer look at what happened to Rondo. Through this collaboration, we determined that if there had been the kind of rigorous environmental review required by NEPA — which would have required both listening to community input and studying the cumulative impacts that would occur over time as a result of the freeway — there could have been a different outcome for Rondo.
But such a step depends on the commitments of good people, and we need the protection of the law. There are 1,200 Rondos scattered across America, all fighting their own battles and all either wishing they’d had NEPA in place to save their communities from the same fate as ours, or relying on NEPA to protect their communities and keep them healthy and safe.
If the Trump administration goes forward with watering down the regulations for public input and cumulative impacts consideration in the way that is currently proposed, stories like Rondo’s are going to happen again, and again, and again. The elimination of these existing regulations, and rules like them, are designed to keep communities like mine in the dark. It’s antithetical to good government, and it deprives the average citizen of the right to make his or her voice known. It’s devastating.
As someone who went through this process before communities even had a say, and who experienced the negative aftereffects, I hope this administration will seriously consider eliminating these proposed restrictions on public commentary — and instead make it easier for the public to comment and engage in the NEPA process. This will result in better, stronger projects that are better for communities and the public as a whole — which is, after all the role of the federal government — to serve the public and allow for the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness."
"May 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-president-s-obamagate-theory-there-s-something-there/570627352/,StarTribune,The president's 'Obamagate' theory: There's something there,"A recent headline in the New York Times — a paper of record for the anti-Trump Resistance — was adamant:
“Barr Dismisses Trump’s Claim That Russia Inquiry Was an Obama Plot.”
Reading that, you might come away believing that Attorney General William Barr had just brushed off President Donald Trump’s much-tweeted Obamagate theory. Trump insists the now-discredited Russia collusion probe against him was an Obama scheme.
Only one problem with the headline: Barr didn’t dismiss it. Barr did not say there was no plot.
He did not say that former President Barack Obama or his vice president, Joe Biden — now the presumptive Democratic nominee — had nothing to do with it.
The Russia collusion investigation tore the country apart. It cost some $40 million and lasted almost three years, leading to partisan impeachment proceedings against Trump, which failed to result in a conviction. Run by special counsel Robert Mueller, it found no credible evidence to accuse any American with colluding with Russia in the 2016 election.
But the hysterical media and partisan finger-pointing that came with it did accomplish something of value.
It allowed Obama and establishment Democratic Party bosses to escape blame for backing Hillary Clinton and losing the White House to Trump. If they could blame Russia for Trump, they could herd anti-establishment Democrats like the Bernie Bros into a safe space and keep control of their party. And so, it was done.
Despite the Times’ headline, and much of the media coverage over Barr’s remarks, all Barr said was that he did not anticipate, based on what he knows now, any criminal investigations into Obama or Biden.
But if you search the negative space between what happened and what may come, you’ll see evidence of the panic among Obama’s servants, his Washington Kemalists. Like their namesakes in Turkey years ago, they acted as if their mission were to protect the state against the will of the people, elections or no elections, and keep their hold on awesome power.
These include Obama’s former CIA director, John Brennan, former FBI chief James Comey, former FBI counterintelligence boss Peter “Insurance Policy” Strzok. The list is long. If there’s anyone in this crew who looks like he’ll wear the jacket for it, it’s Strzok.
If I were casting the movie, I’d have Strzok played by Edward Norton, an actor renowned for releasing his inner weasel.
I’m writing this from Chicago on a rainy day, not from the Washington Beltway. But if I might borrow from Strzok, I’d say you can smell the fear on them from here.
The news buzz is all about Trump taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off the coronavirus, and the pandemic fills the American bandwidth. But the story of Obama’s Kemalists continues. This is why Obama and crew are outraged and busy whipping up their useful idiots. They can see what’s coming.
What’s already come out in just a few weeks is a saga papered with lies peddled by spymasters and politicians to journalists. Some former spymasters testified under oath before Congress that they had no evidence on Trump-Russia collusion, then eagerly went out on cable news for pay to shout that Trump was a tool of Vladimir Putin.
There were lies supporting the now-discredited Steele dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign, and lies to the FISA courts, and the Obama administration’s political unmasking of Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.
Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversation with a Russian diplomat. His champions say he was pressured by federal threats against his son. Barr dropped the case and called it a trap. There were a series of serious prosecution errors, including an FBI official wondering in a case file if agents were questioning Flynn to “get him to lie, so we can prosecute him, or get him fired.”
Some Obama supporters, including former prosecutors, offer the dissenting view. They’re adamant that dropping the Flynn case would cast a shadow on all political corruption cases. Others, including me, think the targeting of Flynn was all about getting him out of the way, so the Kemalists could proceed against Trump.
Pressure is being applied. People will flip. Some editors of newspapers that received Pulitzers for covering the now-failed Russia collusion saga may think about assigning investigative reporters to walk back this cat and find out just who kept giving it milk. But time is growing short.
Barr’s investigator, respected career prosecutor John Durham, closes in. The Beltway attacks on Barr reach fever pitch. What Barr actually did say in his recent news conference doesn’t exonerate the Obama administration. It damns it.
It should be carved into the walls of the planned multimillion-dollar Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, or as I call it, The Obama Temple of Adoration and Fealty.
“Over the past few decades there have been increasing attempts to use the criminal justice system as a political weapon,” Barr said, clearly referencing both Republican and Democratic Party excesses.
“The legal tactic has been to gin up allegations of criminality by one’s political opponents based upon the flimsiest of legal theories,” Barr said. “This is not a good development. It is not good for our political life and it’s not good for the criminal justice system. And as long as I’m attorney general, the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends; and this is especially true for the upcoming elections in November.”
That is as it should be.
But before November, Americans must find out exactly what happened with the Obama White House and the Russia collusion investigation, and why."
"May 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-cities-counties-are-strained-as-667m-in-aid-remains-in-limbo/570606192/,StarTribune,"Minnesota cities, counties are strained as $667M in aid remains in limbo","The Legislature ended its work Sunday without a decision on how to distribute $667 million in federal aid for counties, cities and towns — leaving cash-strapped communities in limbo as coronavirus costs pile up.
Local governments across Minnesota are struggling with unexpected expenses, from personal protective equipment and overtime costs for public safety workers to new remote setups for employees. Some states have already shared federal CARES Act dollars with communities dealing with the pandemic’s fallout. But Minnesota’s leaders have been tied up in negotiations over how to distribute the money.
“The impact of the pandemic is real. … It is incredibly painful,” said Duluth Mayor Emily Larson. “We have $667 million sitting in the state’s account right now to be disseminated to cities, and there is no current path by which we can access any of that. And, in the meantime, we are laying off staff, we are cutting city services, we are delaying projects. It’s our residents who are experiencing the impact of that devastation.”
The Republican majority in the state Senate and DFL House leaders clashed over how to dole out the money in recent weeks, and the issue got ensnared in other end-of-session deals at the Capitol. The Legislature could try to reach a compromise by mid-June, when they anticipate returning for a special session.
But Gov. Tim Walz could beat them to it.
“Governor Walz and his administration understand the urgency felt by communities to get these funds out the door. We plan to have guidelines in place within the next week,” Cynthia Bauerly, Revenue Department commissioner, said in a statement Tuesday.
The governor technically could immediately start divvying up the money, which is part of the nearly $1.9 billion the state received last month through the CARES Act.
The Walz administration had no comment Tuesday on whether it will also start distributing money next week, and whether legislators would be involved with shaping the guidelines.
Meanwhile, the pandemic has continued to put a crunch on city budgets.
Widespread business closures meant to slow the spread of coronavirus are causing tax revenue to drop, while cities are spending more to provide aid to struggling residents and buy materials to protect employees.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said during a public meeting May 6 that preliminary 2021 budget forecasts showed a potential deficit of up to $34 million, and that the city accrued unexpected expenses related to COVID-19.
In Minneapolis, the budget office expects revenue could drop as much as $200 million this year, or roughly 12%. At the same time, the city reported $4.7 million in pandemic-related spending, as of last week.
The city’s elected officials, including Mayor Jacob Frey and City Council President Lisa Bender, have been asking state lawmakers to provide aid, including a portion of the state’s CARES Act funding. Because the city’s population is below 500,000, it did not receive direct federal funding from the CARES Act.
The only local governments in Minnesota that met that threshold are Hennepin and Ramsey counties, which received a combined $317 million. GOP state lawmakers want those counties to share the money with cities inside their borders, while Democrats said the two major counties should use those funds as they see fit.
Taking that money from counties would hamper their efforts to provide other much-needed services, such as temporary shelter for the homeless and assistance for hospitals and small businesses, Hennepin County Commissioner Jan Callison said.
“It simply will impede our ability to respond to the crisis,” she said.
Sen. Julie Rosen, R-Vernon Center, said she is hearing from communities in her district who want the state to act quickly on the CARES Act money. Rosen, who sponsored the Senate GOP’s plan to disburse the dollars, said that speed is critical.
But it is more important to ensure that one person — Walz — doesn’t have control over hundreds of millions, she said.
“I see it as a complete overreach” if Walz decides how to use the money, Rosen said, and the Legislature would be “usurped of their authority.”
A six-person Legislative Advisory Commission has oversight of the governor’s use of federal money, but does not have veto power.
Other issues divide Republicans, the Walz administration and House DFL’s plans for the $667 million.
Rosen has suggested distributing all of it right away, while Democrats want to reserve some of the cash to use as future hot spots emerge.
Counties also have differing viewpoints on which way would be best, Association of Minnesota Counties spokesman Matt Hilgart said. But there’s an overwhelming preference for getting the dollars into local hands quickly, he said, adding, “No one is served well by waiting on this.”"
"May 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-seniors-disabled-still-battling-isolation-despite-loosening-of-restrictions/570563012/,StarTribune,"Minnesota seniors and people with disabilities still battling isolation, despite loosening of COVID-19 restrictions","Lauren Thompson felt a sense of foreboding when she learned last week that Minnesota was rolling back restrictions meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
For Thompson, 32, who was born with cerebral palsy and is more susceptible to infection, the social-distancing rules that had been in force since early March offered some assurance that her caregivers would not bring the virus into her home.
“In many ways, I feel less safe” since Gov. Tim Walz loosened his stay-home orders, said Thompson, who has been mostly isolated at her parents’ house in Brooklyn Park since the pandemic began. “My life is the same, but the people who are helping me are out and about and socializing, which means my risk of infection goes up.”
The decision by Walz to begin a gradual reopening of the economy — and to let Minnesotans leave the house more — has brought little comfort to many of the state’s most vulnerable residents, including older adults and individuals with disabilities. For these groups, life goes on much the same as before, except now their social safety net has been torn. The extreme isolation that accompanied the pandemic is likely to persist for vulnerable adults, in part because the relaxed rules do not apply to them.
The executive order issued last week gave the green light for many businesses to reopen. At the same time, the order strongly urged “at-risk persons,” including people over age 65 and those with underlying health conditions, to remain at home. “It’s clear from this [executive] order that people with disabilities will have to wait longer to enjoy the same freedoms as everyone else,” said Roberta Opheim, state ombudsman for mental health and developmental disabilities.
Going into the 2020 legislative session, there was rare consensus among disability rights groups and lawmakers around the need to promote more independence and inclusion for Minnesotans with disabilities. There were ambitious proposals to modernize the state’s costly and antiquated system for disbursing billions of dollars of Medicaid benefits, to give people more control over their own services and living arrangements, and to phase out the long-standing practice of paying less than the minimum wage to workers with disabilities.
In the end, the session ended with the passage of one significant measure, reforming Minnesota’s guardianship law. More than 22,000 adults across the state live under the supervision of court-appointed guardians, who often gain broad authority over the people they are assigned to protect. The bill requires that disabled adults be offered a less-intrusive alternative to guardianship, which would empower them to make their own life decisions.
But with every state agency and lawmakers consumed by coronavirus concerns, the topic of disability rights was mostly relegated to the sidelines. “Changing an entire system and breaking down barriers to inclusion is a very big deal, and we are going to keep pushing for this agenda” if the Legislature is called back into special session, said Jim Abeler, R-Anoka, who oversees a key human services committee.
The status quo has been challenging for this population.
In March, disability service providers across the state began shuttering day and employment centers in response to the pandemic, leaving thousands of people with physical and developmental disabilities in the lurch. Even with emergency measures, these day centers remain closed. As a result, nearly 30,000 Minnesota adults with disabilities have been cut off from a place to go during the day for social interaction, vocational training and other services.
On Wednesday, Human Services Commissioner Jodi Harpstead said that, after a careful review, the day activity centers would be kept closed for now to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their vulnerable clients. In day activity centers, Harpstead noted, people are interacting with one another in closed environments for long periods, significantly increasing their risk of contracting the virus. In addition, many of the people who attend day activity centers also live in four-bedroom group homes; there is a risk that they could bring the coronavirus back to these settings, exposing more people, she said.
At the same time, she said, the DHS has been in talks with the state association of day activity providers regarding ways services can be provided without risking the spread of infection. Some ideas being considered include allowing services to be offered remotely, having centers operate with reduced hours, and allowing services to be provided in private homes rather than in centers, she said. The agency is also exploring the possibility of allowing day activity staff to provide services within group homes, much like personal care assistants.
“We agonized about this,” Harpstead said of the decision to keep the group homes closed. “From the beginning, our very first decisions have all been about safety, health and protecting people from catching COVID.”
She added, “At the same time, all of us are not getting our full dose of emotional, spiritual and social supports right now, and sacrificing some things for not catching the virus.”
Some disability service providers have been starved of funding for so long that they are permanently closing their doors. Last week, for instance, the Salvation Army announced it was closing a day activity center in Maplewood because of a sustained lack of funding. The decision has left between 30 to 35 seniors with chronic physical and cognitive disabilities without a destination during the day for social interaction, exercise, Bible lessons and other activities.
“With the loss of revenue and the added cost of new program requirements, we just couldn’t find a way to make this program financially feasible in the COVID-19 era,” said Lt. Col. Lonneal Richardson, commander of the Salvation Army’s Northern Division.
Such closures can upend the lives of family members, who often rely on such centers as a respite from providing round-the-clock care.
Linda Christensen, of St. Paul, said she enrolled her 84-year-old husband in the Salvation Army’s center last summer after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The center provided a level of “mental and spiritual stimulation” that Christensen said she could not provide at home. Now that it’s closed, Christensen has to keep eyes on him constantly to ensure he doesn’t wander. Fatigue is setting in.
“I feel the gate has closed for us and it’s remained closed,” Christensen said. “The relaxing of [stay-at-home] rules doesn’t change life for us.” She added, “If anything, it may make matters worse. If I get the coronavirus because people let their guard down, then who is going to take care of my husband?”
Isolation remains another major concern. Even before the coronavirus arrived in Minnesota, adult foster-care facilities and home care agencies were struggling with a shortage of support staff. Those shortages have worsened, in part because workers have feared being infected in these homes. As a result, many people in group homes have no one to take them out into the community, advocates say.
Since March, the Minnesota Disability Law Center has received a sharp increase in reports from group home residents complaining of extreme isolation, said Dan Stewart, the center’s legal director. In some cases, healthy residents in these homes have been ordered to stay in their rooms, in violation of their civil rights, he said. In one case, a group home resident was prevented from going to work, even though the person had an essential job, Stewart said. And accommodations are often not being made for families to visit.
“Doors are being shut that don’t need to be shut,” Stewart said. “Broadly speaking, we are facing the same age-old questions of how to balance the rights of the many with the rights of the few.”
For now, Thompson just wants to return home. After the pandemic hit, a sudden shortage of caregivers made it impossible for her to stay in her supported apartment in Champlin, so she moved in with her parents. Thompson sleeps in the same room she did as a child, surrounded by the stuffed animals and coloring books that she enjoyed as a 3-year-old.
“I never thought I’d be back here,” Thompson said of her childhood room. “It’s both comforting and awkward at the same time.”"

Well, one patient who asked his doctor is President Donald Trump, who “heard a lot of good stories” how hydroxychloroquine and zinc could ward off coronavirus.
The way Trump told it Monday, the White House physician said OK and wrote the prescription for him to take the pill daily. A week and a half later, so far, so good, says the huckster who calls himself president.
We trust the White House doc would only prescribe a drug he believes to be in the best interest of his patient. We pray there was no undue pressure from a man who’s called the drug a “game changer” as contrary evidence has mounted, including FDA warnings that it presents serious risks to the human heart.
By touting the pill to millions, Trump now encourages countless people to besiege their doctors with pleas for their own prescriptions, leaving lupus and rheumatoid arthritis patients who truly need the now-scarce drug high and dry. Bad medicine indeed.
A far better use of Trump’s time would’ve been showing the world how easy it is to get a COVID test. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo did his nose test on TV. Monday, he reported back negative.
Trump says that he doesn’t like the nose test. Instead, he’s thumbing his nose at the experts again — with potentially fateful results."
"May 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/what-scientists-are-learning-to-try-to-be-ready-for-what-s-after-covid-19/570679302/,StarTribune,What scientists are learning to try to be ready for what's after COVID-19,"CHICAGO – More than a decade ago, a center was founded at Northwestern University as a rapid-response operation against infectious disease. But its work was sporadic — a boom when epidemics hit, a bust when they were under control.
Now, researchers with the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases are rushing to find a treatment for COVID-19, making up for lost time. And they hope they’ll be ready for whatever comes next.
“I think we’re making substantial strides,” said Karla Satchell, director of the center who is a professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “Our hope is that we can do something in time to help this round of the pandemic. But at the very least, we can do enough that this won’t happen again.”
Andy Mesecar, an expert in biochemistry and gene therapy, is on the front lines of that fight. He has been working seven-day weeks, racing to find a drug for COVID-19, teaching at Purdue University and submitting daily reports to the National Institutes of Health.
His lab is one of the leading centers studying coronaviruses, and he and his team have dedicated nearly two decades to the research. With a background in biochemistry and structural biology, Mesecar started out studying enzymes that could fight cancer. He got into infectious diseases after the anthrax attacks in the weeks after 9/11. Then, he pivoted to studying enzymes that could be used against SARS when it surfaced in November 2002. “My training in structural biology allows me to work on any diseases that go around,” he said. “I can apply it to any disease and do so rapidly.”
The bulk of coronavirus research began during the SARS epidemic and through the MERS outbreak less than 10 years later. Hardly anything was known about coronaviruses at the time, Satchell said, so researchers sprinted to learn its biochemistry.
During the basic science phase of drug discovery, researchers identify the genetic sequence of a protein or enzyme that is essential to the virus’ replication, then look for a compound that blocks it, called the inhibitor. The compounds are developed into a drug that not only lasts long enough in the body to kill the virus but is also nontoxic. Only then can it move to animal trials.
Mesecar spent years studying SARS, then MERS. But as the outbreaks waned, funding dried up. To continue their work, his team scoured for small amounts of funding, but even three years ago, they didn’t have enough to support a single person fully. Then the center at Northwestern stepped in.
But the lull in funding had already done its damage, Satchell said. No clinical trials of the compounds had been done by the time the pandemic hit. “Nothing ever got out of the laboratory (for SARS),” she said. “There’s no treatment for COVID-19 that is specific to this virus and this infection, and the research tracking it really seems like it just ended.”
When MERS emerged in 2012, Mesecar’s team switched to this new coronavirus, publishing papers that shared their discovery of compounds that worked against it. He and his team were among the first to predict that the next coronavirus outbreak would come from bats, the suspected origin of COVID-19. “Everything we did was to predict the next outbreak,” he said. “What we wanted to do was to have compounds that could rapidly move toward the particular coronavirus strain that emerged.”
Satchell, Mesecar and others point to earlier failings as a cautionary tale. Mesecar said researchers should study the effects of certain compounds on animals so they could be more quickly developed when new viruses appear. This was the key to remdesivir reaching patients now. “We’re not as far behind as we could be because of the love and ingenuity of scientists who want to pursue and learn about it,” he said.
The coronavirus field is undergoing a rapid change. Satchell said, more funding will be needed — and more scientists will need to remain in the field. She’s seen this effect with tuberculosis, anthrax attacks and SARS, and she believes this pandemic will yield similar results. In order to be prepared for the next public health threat, she said, scientists will need to break new ground.
“You can make a lot of movement fast, based on what you know,” Satchell said. “But at some point, you hit a wall where you have to discover new things.”"
"May 22, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/if-trump-and-pence-both-get-very-sick-it-s-unclear-who-would-be-president/570695142/,StarTribune,"If Trump and Pence both get very sick, it's unclear who would be president","It remains unlikely, but hardly unthinkable, that President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence could simultaneously come down with serious cases of COVID-19 — especially after two prominent White House aides recently tested positive for the coronavirus. We have already seen one head of government, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, incapacitated by COVID-19 and sent to an intensive care unit.
Both men are in high-risk groups: Trump is 73 and overweight; Pence is 60. (Johnson, in contrast, is a comparatively youthful 55.) If they were “ordinary” people, the protocol would be for the two men to place themselves in self-quarantine for two weeks, yet they have not done so.
When Johnson was hospitalized, he deputized his foreign minister to act as prime minister in his absence. Should only the president become ill, then the vice president can take over, following the protocol laid out in the 25th Amendment. But if the vice president becomes incapacitated as well, then we could face a constitutional crisis. It would be triggered by the inadequacies of the Presidential Succession Act passed in 1947 (when there was no vice president, because Harry Truman had succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt).
Article II of the Constitution grants Congress the right to “provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President” — and the 1947 act is the current result. Under its rules, the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate would be next in the line of succession, followed by the members of the Cabinet, beginning with the secretary of state.
Until 1947, succession had passed through the Cabinet. Congress added the speaker and president pro tem on the grounds that the president should desirably be an elected official, even if not part of the executive branch. This might make sense in theory, but it could be truly terrible in practice. Should both Pence and Trump be unable to serve, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D.-Calif., would become president under the act — handing the White House to a different party without an election. Should she be unable or unwilling to serve, then the office would go to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
Any effort to transfer power from Trump and Pence to Pelosi would surely inspire legal and political challenges, adding to chaos at precisely the moment the nation desperately needed stability.
To be sure, COVID-19 in the White House could precipitate a crisis well before the Succession Act came into play. It is not difficult to imagine that Trump would deny — and denounce as “fake news” — any suggestion that he lacks the ability, in the words of Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution, “to discharge the Powers and Duties” of the presidency. The vice president and Cabinet can, in theory, overrule him and pronounce him unable to serve, invoking the 25th Amendment. But would they? Even if Pence and the Cabinet displayed independence, would Trump simply fire those who “betrayed” him? He couldn’t fire the vice president, but the vice president cannot displace a president on his own; he needs the support of the majority of Cabinet officials — and then Congress.
But even if the headstrong president bowed to reality, perhaps as he was about to go on a ventilator, the system would be stretched to the breaking point if Pence faced his own health crisis. If Pence, too, acknowledged his constitutional “inability,” then the Succession Act would apply — and its flaws would become apparent.
The act, first of all, bespeaks a simplistic theory of democratic legitimacy that ignores the prominent role that political parties — which have grown far more polarized since 1947 — play in the American system. And it raises vexing legal and practical questions. Most lawyers believe that the speaker would have to resign from the House to serve as president, as a result of the Constitution’s obscure incompatibility clause, which says that “no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.” Perhaps, then, Pelosi would waive her right of succession (since, after all, her “term” would probably last only several weeks at most). So then the 86-year-old Grassley could take on the awesome role of president — should he be willing to resign from the Senate.
There is also a serious argument, first laid out by Yale Law School professor Akhil Reed Amar and his brother, Vikram Amar, now dean of the University of Illinois College of Law, in a 1995 essay in the Stanford Law Review, that the Succession Act is unconstitutional. Article II specifically says that Congress — in setting rules of succession — must select an “officer” as a replacement for the president and vice president. Members of Congress, the argument goes, are not “officers,” because they are elected officials and not presidential appointees. (Another legal argument holds that the incompatibility clause does not apply if a member of Congress were to serve as president or vice president, because “officers” refers to people appointed by the president, not to the chief executive position itself. Under that interpretation, Pelosi could retain her legislative office, if the act were upheld as constitutional.)
To put it mildly, it is hard to imagine these questions being litigated in real time should Republicans try to prevent Pelosi from taking office, or should she try to serve as president and speaker simultaneously. This month, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh evoked the possibility of “chaos” in a Supreme Court argument about “unfaithful electors” — members of the electoral college who opt for candidates besides the ones they pledged to support. The problem of unfaithful electors is trivial compared with the true chaos possible under the Succession Act.
Constitutionality aside, the Succession Act makes little sense as policy: No one seriously believes that the worthies who serve as speaker of the House and president pro tem of the Senate do so because of a belief by the House or Senate that they have the skill set needed to serve as president. Indeed, Grassley occupies his office exclusively because he is the senior member of the majority.
Just as the United States turns out to have been woefully unprepared to confront the coronavirus, so are we unprepared to confront simultaneous presidential and vice-presidential disability. Returning to the pre-1947 rules, under which the secretary of state would follow the vice president in the line of succession, would make far more sense. The Constitution authorizes — is it too much to suggest that it even places a duty on? — Congress to address the possibility that the president and vice president could both become incapacitated. It should face up to its responsibility, before the grim scenario becomes reality."

For those of us who have moved too many times over the years, staying put seems like a good thing. It isn’t, at least for the economy. Americans’ traditional willingness to pack up and move for a better job elsewhere was a big plus for the economy and something that separated us from more static labor markets in Europe, spurring faster growth here.
While most short moves are spurred by housing or family reasons, half of long-distance moves are for jobs, according to a new research brief from Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. In 1990, 3.3% of Americans made interstate moves each year; today, that number is around 1.5%, and that is worrisome.
“Economists say that high migration rates allow labor markets to have flexibility and adaptability, and that low migration rates can lead to stagnation and income divergence between places,” writes Riordan Frost, the author of the Harvard research brief.
Some believe that declining mobility contributes to growing income inequality. In his 2012 book “The New Geography of Jobs” economist Enrico Moretti wrote that the U.S. was segregating, with highly educated workers in high-income, high-cost areas, and less-educated workers in low-income, low-cost areas.
It wasn’t always so. America was a country built by people willing to move. In 1948, the country’s mobility rate, or number of Americans who moved each year, was 20.2%, according to the Harvard research brief. As recent as the mid-1980s, it hovered around 18%.
It’s been declining since. From 2018 to 2019, the most recent data available, the mobility rate was 10%.
Why, say, aren’t more registered nurses moving? Average pay for registered nurses, according to federal data compiled by Nurse.org, ranges from a low of $59,540 in South Dakota to $113,240 in California. Housing prices and other factors have people staying put, but at a tremendous cost. Teacher pay also varies widely.
Many factors have made us less willing to move. People tend to move less as they age, and America is becoming an older country. The youngest baby boomers are now in their late 50s, while the oldest ones are in their 70s.
The growth in two-income families is another biggie. Even if one spouse is offered a great job in a faraway state, it may not make sense to take it if the other spouse has to give up their job.
The soaring cost of housing in some parts of the country also impedes moves. California and the Northeast have particular trouble attracting migrants from other areas. Meanwhile, lower-cost states like Florida and Texas have profited by attracting immigrants from other states. If that inflow slows, as some economists are predicting, it will hurt their economies.
What effect the coronavirus-induced recession will have on mobility is unclear. Home prices are holding up so far, but there is early evidence that fewer homes are being sold, which could depress mobility.
On the other hand, the Harvard brief says there could be a “spike in mobility” after the quarantine ends and unemployed Americans look for cheaper housing. And, it warns ominously: “There may also be a substantial increase in evictions and foreclosures after temporary bans end, unless payment assistance is provided on a large scale.”"
"May 22, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/rush-to-do-covid-testing-leads-to-waste-harm-u-center-s-report-says/570666482/,StarTribune,University of Minnesota's infectious disease center urges better use of COVID-19 testing,"In the rush to deploy as many COVID-19 tests as possible, important nuances are being lost about which kinds of tests are not worth doing, causing waste and potential harm during the pandemic.
Business managers should not be pinning hopes for reopening on antibody testing of their entire workforces, and hospitals should not be doing universal testing of asymptomatic patients, according to a new report from a University of Minnesota policy center. Both would be a waste of testing capacity that could give patients bad data unless there’s a specific reason for the testing, such as a local outbreak.
And right now, the report concluded, no one should use antibody testing to issue “immunity passports” because the tests can deliver inaccurate results and no one yet knows how protective antibodies are.
“We’re so focused on numbers of people being tested, and we are not focusing on what the accomplishment of that testing is all about,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the U’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), which published the 13-page report this week.
The center hopes to raise awareness about the lack of a cohesive national strategy for diagnosing the pandemic. The report includes a number of cases in which testing would be appropriate within the “smart testing framework” that it advocates.
The medical technology industry has boasted about how fast COVID-19 tests have hit the market. Just six months ago, there was no such thing as a test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the antibodies the body produces to fight it, because the virus itself hadn’t been detected.
As of Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration has received emergency authorization applications for 76 different diagnostic test kits to detect the virus genetically, and another 29 high-complexity diagnostic tests used in certified laboratories like the one at Mayo Clinic.
Meanwhile, more than 100 tests that look for antibodies in blood samples were available just weeks ago, though just 13 are listed as having received emergency-use authorizations today.
Mayo Clinic was among the first health systems to validate an antibody test and has since conducted 7,000 at the request of health system clinicians. Its national reference laboratory also has tested more than 61,000 samples.
New technology continues to hit the market. On May 9, the FDA authorized the first diagnostic antigen test in the U.S., which could deliver reliable positive test results earlier than other forms of testing but cannot be used to rule out an active infection because of its high false-negative rate.
Many biomedical researchers are also focused on the need for a test to detect not just antibodies, but “neutralizing antibodies,” which are tiny proteins that block the virus from penetrating into a host cell.
Rochester, Minn.-based Vyriad says it has used its existing cancer-virology technology platform as a springboard to develop the first commercially available neutralizing antibody test that doesn’t require a high level of bio­hazard containment.
Dr. Stephen Russell, CEO of Vyriad, said the most immediate use of his company’s technology is likely to be for research on vaccine candidates, as the nation works toward the goal of developing 300 million vaccine doses by January under the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed.
The lab-based test will also be useful in screening donors for convalescent plasma experiments, he said. Vyriad signed its first commercial contract to do neutralizing antibody testing on a commercial basis this week and expects to add more. Since Vyriad can process only 1,000 specimens a day, there are plans to expand to other sites, including Mayo Clinic, though that takes weeks to set up.
Russell explained that antibodies are much smaller than a virus, and they tend to swarm all over the exterior “spike protein” arms that give a corona­virus its distinctive appearance.
“Some of those antibodies are capable of blocking the virus from interacting with its receptor and getting into the target cell. Other antibodies are simply not capable of doing that; they just bind to the protein,” Russell said. “They’re of no real value in terms of protecting against infection. So the functional test that we have is for antibodies that neutralize, as opposed to antibodies that just bind.”
Separately, Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota are working on neutralizing antibody research that may generate evidence about the immunity from reinfection after getting COVID-19.
While research with other types of coronaviruses suggests that antibodies provide at least short-term immunity after infection, there’s no definitive proof of a similar effect with the virus that causes COVID-19. A Chinese study in monkeys offered some promise, and a Korean study this week reported that people who suffered second infections seemed to kill off the virus.
Mayo, the U, and the state of Minnesota are all planning to use antibody testing on a large scale for population-level research, which can be used to roughly figure the overall prevalence of COVID-19 in a community.
That’s a strategy CIDRAP endorses, as long as the research methods are transparent and sampling is done in a way that results can be applied to a larger population. CIDRAP estimates that roughly 5% of Americans have already been infected, with many suffering mild or no symptoms and not ever knowing their status.
Research plans include widespread testing over the next year of samples from blood donors to Memorial Blood Centers, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist. But donors are often healthier, so the state also wants antibody testing studies in more diverse populations such as grocery workers, students and health care staff.
“We still don’t know enough yet about protective immunity” for people carrying antibodies, she said, “so the way we are using serology is really to look at how much of the population has been exposed.”
The U is close to a capacity of 15,000 antibody tests per day with the novel version that it created. Patients in the M Health Fairview system are able to request it, but doctors need to understand the limitations before ordering it, said the U’s Dr. Timothy Schacker.
While many antibody tests have been used to check COVID-19 status before patients undergo surgeries or donate plasma as an experimental therapy, some may have been given to patients even though the results offered little therapeutic value, said Elitza Theel, director of Mayo’s Infectious Diseases Serology Laboratory.
“There aren’t too many — really, any — definitive clinical decisions being made on an antibody result,” Theel said. “We really can’t make decisions on whether or not someone should use PPE (personal protective equipment) or adhere to social distancing practices based on an antibody result.”
That’s where the interest in neutralizing antibodies comes in. Finding proof that neutralizing antibodies confer at least some level of protection from reinfection could make a huge difference in nursing homes and moving residents and staff around to protect them, Schacker said.
“If we know they’ve got neutralizing antibodies, we can cohort them together,” he said. “We can start thinking about things like that.”"
"May 22, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/spur-recovery-including-in-minnesota-by-advancing-trade-with-u-k-and-e-u/570707012/,StarTribune,"Spur recovery, including in Minnesota, by advancing trade with U.K and E.U.","The global coronavirus pandemic shouldn't result in a rejection of globalization, particularly regarding trade. In fact, responding to the worldwide economic shock should mean lowering, not raising, trade barriers.
So it's encouraging that the United States and United Kingdom have begun negotiating a new trade agreement. Granted, the pandemic wasn't the spark — politics was, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and a like-minded President Donald Trump, both Brexit backers, try to deliver upon their advocacy. Regardless, there's more reason than ever to forge an accord between Washington and London — as well as one between Washington and Brussels in the form of a U.S.-E.U. free-trade agreement.
Such an accord was in the works — the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership — but was scuttled by President Donald Trump, who demagogued his disapproval of T-TIP as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have served as an invaluable fulcrum against China.
The U.S.-U.K. talks started May 5, with round two of the virtual negotiations to begin June 15. While there is clearly an impetus for both sides to strike a deal, several difficult issues must be addressed. Those include health care and pharmaceuticals, as well as agricultural standards. Because of the complexities, a Biden administration could inherit the talks. If so, the same incentives exist: free and fair trade to boost both nations.
Minnesota has a major stake in the outcome. The U.K. was this state's ninth-largest export nation in 2019, worth about $556 million in goods and services, according to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. Noting our diverse economy, Alan Gogbashian, the British consul general in Chicago, told an editorial writer that a U.S.-U.K. pact would benefit the state. ""I think there's a lot of convergence between the Minnesota approach to recovery and the U.K. one,"" Gogbashian said.
Rather than retreat from the coronavirus crisis, the consul general believes that in the ""COVID context"" an agreement is needed more than ever. ""We need more trade now to help with the recovery; what business needs now is clarity,"" Gogbashian said. ""It's exactly because of the pandemic that [free-trade agreements] are more important than ever. The economic challenges we face are significant, and there's no guarantee it's going to go away anytime soon, so we need a long-term growth plan.""
Advancing pacts with allies like the U.K. and countries in the E.U. is the best place to start, especially since environmental and labor standards are so similar (or superior, in many European nations), Joshua P. Meltzer, a senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, told an editorial writer. Noting that the transatlantic trading relationship is already the most significant for the U.S. and European nations, Meltzer said that, ""Good jobs on both sides rely on the economic relationship and the robustness of it. This should merely be an attempt to just build upon that foundation and make it even stronger and more open to opportunities.""
Indeed, healthy trading relationships are more critical than ever."
"May 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minn-church-leaders-gov-walz-still-at-odds-over-how-to-reopen/570708902/,StarTribune,Trump's threat intensifies tensions over reopening places of worship in Minnesota,"Tensions over when and how to safely reopen places of worship intensified Friday, with President Donald Trump urging the nation’s governors to let religious leaders open their doors immediately.
The Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis had already said it plans to reopen Tuesday at one-third capacity, despite Gov. Tim Walz’s limits on group gatherings. Catholic leaders and Walz met Friday but made no announcement.
Trump threatened Friday to override any governors who fail to immediately open houses of worship, although the White House didn’t cite any law giving him the right to do so. Minnesota churches, synagogues, temples and mosques have been closed since March 18, following Walz’s stay-home order.
The political element brought more confusion to Minnesota’s faith communities, grappling with when and how to congregate without spreading the highly infectious coronavirus. Faith communities feel like “footballs” in the debate, said Bishop Bruce Ough of the United Methodist Church for Minnesota and the Dakotas.
“The most difficult part is there isn’t a consistent message coming from different levels of authority,” said Ough. “It can be difficult to clarify how to move forward.”
United Methodists, said Ough, will continue to take a measured approach to reopening, keeping church doors shut until public health experts recommend otherwise.
“We’ll make decisions based on our faith tradition and safety, and not get caught up in all the bait and cultural divide,” he said.
Walz decided this week to keep attendance at houses of worship capped at 10 people, while allowing restaurants to open for outdoor service. That decision was a surprise and disappointment to a huge block of religious leaders, who had expected the rules affecting them to be relaxed.
Now, many are quietly planning to reopen their houses of worship, regardless of changing signals from St. Paul or Washington.
Carl Nelson, president of Transform Minnesota, which represents the state’s evangelical churches, said many evangelical leaders are preparing to open their doors in the weeks ahead. They’re no longer holding out for state, much less federal, guidance, Nelson said.
River Valley Church megachurch, for example, announced Thursday that it would resume in-person services at its eight locations on June 1.
Nelson suggested that the faith groups in Minnesota could have influenced Trump’s announcement.
“I think the growing reaction of the Catholic and evangelical communities in Minnesota has caught some national attention in the past few days,” Nelson said.
Even within the Catholic community, opinions differ, however. While the Cathedral of St. Paul plans to open May 30 for in-person Masses, the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis does not.
Some religious leaders expressed their frustrations on Twitter and Facebook.
“I do not need the president to tell me I’m essential and need to open,” wrote Pastor Natalia Terfa of Prince of Peace Lutheran in Brooklyn Park.
“The church has been and always will be essential and no pandemic will change that,” Terfa continued. “The CHURCH is open but the BUILDING will remain closed until it is safe for everyone to gather together.”
Walz, meanwhile, met with Catholic leaders Thursday and Friday to try to resolve their differences. The governor’s spokesman, Teddy Tschann, said he is reviewing the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for houses of worship, issued after Trump’s announcement.
An agreement could come together as early as this weekend.
“The governor’s top priority continues to be the health and safety of Minnesotans,” Tschann said."
"May 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/poll-minnesotans-back-stay-at-home-rules/570709152/,StarTribune,Poll: Minnesotans support stay-at-home restrictions as fear of the virus persists,"More than two-thirds of Minnesotans say they won’t return to normal rhythms of daily life even though some social distancing restrictions have been relaxed, and many believe the worst of the corona­virus pandemic is yet to come, according to a new Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 poll.
As anxiety about the virus persists, the poll also found a majority of people support the stay-at-home restrictions and business closures they lived under for nearly two months and say they were necessary to limit the spread of the virus in their communities.
In the poll of 800 registered voters — conducted May 18 through May 20 — 57% of respondents said the restrictions are the right approach to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, while 32% said they have gone too far. Only 9% said the restrictions did not go far enough. Despite partisan divisions, a majority of independents also support the restrictions.
“The rest of them can do whatever they want, but I try and protect myself,” said Gary Lenius, who lives in Two Harbors and supports the restrictions because he’s 78 and at a higher risk of severe illness if he catches the virus. Plus, he said, staying at home fits his lifestyle. “I’m not going to go out and run around, I’m going to play it cautious and wait and see and take my time. That rocking chair fits quite well by this time.”
The Mason-Dixon poll, which has a 3.5% margin of error, comes as DFL Gov. Tim Walz begins to slowly turn the dial on a stay-at-home order that, for 51 days, shuttered noncritical businesses and asked Minnesotans to stay inside except for essential needs and services. That order was lifted on Monday and replaced with a new measure that allows Main Street businesses and retailers to open their doors, while still limiting group gatherings to no more than 10 people.
Under a separate order, bars and restaurants in the state have been closed for dine-in services since March 17, as have movie theaters, gyms, hair salons, concert venues and other public spaces that put people in close contact. Starting June 1, Walz said restaurants and bars can start serving up to 50 patrons outdoors and hair salons and barbershops can reopen at 25% capacity, as long as employees and customers wear masks.
Support for Walz’s restrictions is higher among women, people living in Hennepin and Ramsey counties and those who identify as Democrats. But strong support for the restrictions was found statewide, not only in urban areas. A majority of independents also back the restrictions, with 60% saying they’re about right or don’t go far enough, compared with 37% who said they’ve gone too far.
Statewide, 65% of Republicans say the restrictions have gone too far. Walz’s orders also have come under sharp attack from conservative groups and GOP lawmakers in the Minnesota Legislature, who argue they’ve been applied unevenly and will lead to a devastating economic downturn. Since March, about 700,000 Minnesotans have filed for unemployment benefits.
Mark Peterson, who has owned an auto repair businesses for more than 30 years, said he’s taken a hit as people have been driving less and staying close to home during the crisis. He said Walz’s restrictions have gone “way too far.”
“I just find it difficult to think that the government can tell a small business not to be open, and that’s their livelihood,” said Peterson. “If somebody told me I couldn’t open my door or couldn’t do what I put my whole life into, I’d really be upset about it and fight it.”
He was one of the 36% of Minnesotans who say they have had someone in their household lose a job or income due to the pandemic. The economic toll appeared to be spread fairly evenly across the state, with just about 50% of people in all regions saying no one in their home had lost income. The rest did not have any workers in the house.
Peterson, who splits his time between Cohasset and Owatonna, said store closures are what keep him from going out right now, not health concerns. However, given the recent COVID-19 outbreak at the Viracon glass factory in Owatonna, he said he would be more cautious in that area. But when he is in rural Cohasset, near Grand Rapids, he hasn’t felt a need to change his lifestyle much.
“I’m from a smaller community where I don’t feel like I have to worry quite as bad. Maybe if I was in the middle of a big city, I would have a different thought,” Peterson said. He also said he might be more cautious if he were frequently around the elderly or people with health complications.
Peterson is part of 29% of respondents who said they will resume their normal activities as restrictions are lifted. But a third of those polled said they will continue to limit how much they go out. Another 27% said their movements will be “very limited” and 11% said they will continue to shelter inside until there’s a vaccine or the risk of the virus fades.
A plurality of people polled — 42% — believe the worst of the pandemic is yet to come, as the number of lab-confirmed cases continues to rise and Minnesota has seen new highs for the total number of deaths in one day. Thirty percent of respondents said the virus is not a problem in their community, while 16% said the state is experiencing the worst of the pandemic now.
COVID-19 has popped up in almost all Minnesota counties, but according to Minnesota Department of Health data, some counties have a higher concentration of cases. State officials have warned they expect the state to hit a peak in cases sometime in July, with a possible second wave later this year.
“I get concerned when I hear all of these scientists talk about how bad the fall and winter will be,” said Elaina Buzzell, who lives in Minneapolis. “I would love for this to be over, I would love to get a cure and we can be done with this. I don’t know anybody who doesn’t want that and I hope it works out,” she said. “Knowing how much a regular seasonal flu can wreak havoc on people, having that and [coronavirus] at the same time is something I’m personally pretty nervous about.”
However, only 10% of respondents said they are very worried about getting seriously ill with COVID-19, with more than half saying they are not too worried or not worried at all. Among those living in greater Minnesota, just 5% or fewer are very worried about getting seriously sick.
A little more than a third of those surveyed said they know someone who has tested positive for the virus, with people living in Hennepin and Ramsey counties slightly more likely to know someone who has been infected.
As with support for Walz’s restrictions, women were more likely to be concerned about getting sick. And fears about the illness appear starkly split along partisan lines.
While 22% of Democrats said they are very worried about getting a serious case of COVID-19, less than 1% of Republicans expressed that same level of worry. Among Republicans, 82% said they were not too worried about getting seriously sick or not worried at all.
While health experts say the elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19, statewide nearly two-thirds of poll respondents ages 18 to 34 supported stay-at-home restrictions.
Sergio Salgado, a 26-year-old from Mankato who works at a private college, said he’s not worried about getting sick from the virus. But even with relaxed rules, he said he plans to stay in to protect those around him who are more vulnerable.
“I’m a young millennial. I’m not susceptible to it,” he said. “But it would be incredibly selfish for me to at least not protect those around me who could be autoimmune compromised and could be susceptible to the disease.”"
"May 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/political-divide-evident-even-in-wearing-masks-minnesota-poll-finds/570709122/,StarTribune,"Political divide evident even in wearing masks, Minnesota Poll finds","Face masks have become the defining image of the coronavirus pandemic, and increasingly the focus of the political divide over the crisis.
But nearly three-quarters of Minnesota voters polled said they had worn face masks or coverings when leaving home in the week preceding a Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll.
Regardless of whether respondents were sorted by ideological preference, geographic area or age group, majorities said they’d donned a mask.
But the poll also showed clear differences.
The poll, conducted May 18-20, found that 92% of Democrats and 75% of independents had worn a mask the previous week, compared with 53% of Republicans.
In Minneapolis, DFL Mayor Jacob Frey has since announced he will require that people use face coverings in stores and other indoor gathering places. Violators will risk a $1,000 fine.
Across the country, mask policies have provoked scattered confrontations, some violent.
For some, face masks have become a political emblem. Republican lawmakers in Minnesota and in Washington have been less likely to wear them than their Democratic counterparts. President Donald Trump has shown a strong reluctance to don a mask.
That partisanship was clear in the Minnesota Poll of 800 people, conducted as state infections and deaths continued to rise. Statewide, 47% of Republicans said they had not worn a mask in the preceding week, compared to 8% who identified as Democrats.
The poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, has an overall margin of error of 3.5%.
Women were more likely to wear masks, with 80% saying they’d done so, compared with 68% of men. And residents of Hennepin and Ramsey counties wore them more than those in the suburbs or greater Minnesota.
For many, like Andrea Messina of Forest Lake, mask use has been sporadic. She said she wore one when she went to buy a camper the previous week because the business requested it. Messina also uses a mask to shop at Costco, which requires members to wear them. She said she doesn’t wear one at other stores or on other errands. Her community is less populated than others around the metro, so she said it feels safer.
“When it first hit, everyone is a little paranoid and panicked,” Messina said. She wore masks more often then. “Now that it’s become a part of daily life, I can kind of relax and find how I actually am going to deal with it myself.”
Authorities have sought to preserve high-grade face masks for health care workers in direct contact with infected patients. But in April, the Trump administration started encouraging people to make and wear cloth masks. With the rapid spread of the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been urging the general public to wear masks or other coverings. They offer at least partial protection when indoors with people outside one’s immediate social circle or when social distancing is not possible.
Because respiratory droplets are the primary way the virus spreads, health authorities say widespread use of masks helps limit new cases. And some public health officials have credited masks with helping control the spread of COVID-19 in countries where their use is prevalent.
Dennis Boyer, who lives in veterans and community housing near Fort Snelling, has a store of masks and wears one whenever he goes out. He has underlying health conditions and is wary of the virus. Boyer’s been thinking about doubling up on cloth masks.
“Being safe in this time is smart,” he said.
But Mark Peterson, who spends most of his time in a rural community, said he hasn’t worn a mask and doesn’t see the point.
“If somebody sneezes on you and it gets in your eyes, I don’t care if you have a mask on or not, it’s not going to help,” he said.
The debate has intensified as Gov. Tim Walz has allowed more businesses to reopen. On June 1, restaurants and bars can open outdoor patios, and salons and barbershops can restart. The state is requiring masks of hair stylists and their customers, as well as for food workers."
"May 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minn-churches-can-open-at-25-occupancy/570721802/,StarTribune,Gov. Tim Walz to let Minnesota churches open at 25% occupancy,"Places of worship in Minnesota may open at 25% occupancy starting Wednesday so long as they follow public health guidelines, Gov. Tim Walz said Saturday.
Walz expressed reservations with the change, which comes as the coronavirus continues to spread. But it resolved a conflict with the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, which dropped plans to defy Walz and reopen churches Tuesday at one-third capacity.
Archbishop Bernard Hebda said in a statement that the executive order from Walz is “an important breakthrough … that allows faith communities to accommodate up to 250 people for worship services, provided precautions are taken.”
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, credited faith leaders with pushing for the change, saying that churches “rightfully felt left behind as other businesses were given more room to reopen.”
Walz said the decision to loosen restrictions was difficult because even though worship is essential for many Minnesotans, large gatherings raise a significant risk of spreading the virus.
On Saturday, the state reported the largest one-day jump in cases thus far — 840. And deaths from COVID-19 in the past week — 152 — exceeded the previous seven-day tally.
“We are still on the way up — we are not at that peak yet,” Walz told reporters. He said the state was launching a partnership with faith leaders to make sure “that as we move to try and have some of these places of worship open up they’re done with a common goal of the safety and security of not only the congregants, but of the community at large.”
Beginning Wednesday, places of worship, funeral homes and other venues that offer gathering space for weddings, funerals and planned services may do so with over 10 people attending, so long as they adhere to certain requirements, according to the executive order.
The venues must ensure a minimum of 6 feet of physical distance between households. At indoor settings, occupancy must not exceed 25% of normal capacity as determined by the fire marshal, with a maximum of 250 people in a single, self-contained space. In outdoor settings, gatherings must not exceed 250 individuals.
Hebda said it’s up to parishes to decide if they’re ready for a return to public mass, adding that the obligation to attend continues to be dispensed “if the faithful feel safer at home.”
Can choose to reopen
The archdiocese, as well as the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, said last week that they would defy Walz’s decision at that time to limit religious services to 10 people.
On Saturday, the Rev. Lucas Woodford, president of the Minnesota South District of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, praised Walz’s announcement. It doesn’t mean all 247 congregations that Woodford oversees will reopen. Rather, they will now have that choice.
“We are extremely grateful the governor entered into a dialogue with us,” said Woodford, calling Walz “genuine and sincere.”
Walz and faith leaders met late last week to resolve the dispute, which took on a national dimension Friday when President Donald Trump threatened to attempt to override governors who failed to immediately open houses of worship, although it was unclear what authority he could invoke.
The Minnesota Department of Health on Saturday was set to publish guidelines to help churches open safely. Those that choose to reopen must develop preparedness plans, including detailed cleaning practices and social distancing guidelines. The state is strongly recommending that all congregants wear masks and refrain from group singing, said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner.
But Malcolm urged venues to consider sticking with changes already implemented, such as for virtual services, rather than bringing together large groups. She added that people 65 and older and others at high risk from the virus should consider avoiding services.
Medical conditions that put people at greater risk range from lung disease, serious heart conditions and cancer to severe obesity, diabetes and kidney disease that requires dialysis.
“To be candid, the 250 number terrifies me …” Walz said. “[But] the faith community leaders have been working on this for weeks and have been incredibly thoughtful.”
Intensive care units at Twin Cities hospitals have been getting busier over the past two weeks as they treat more patients with COVID-19 and other health problems. Malcolm said Saturday that two Level 1 trauma centers have had to activate additional beds.
“We continue to see pretty rapid increases in our numbers of cases and deaths,” she said. “So, even though we are slowly and carefully trying to open up … this does not mean we’re on the other side of this.”
Some will livestream
Several large faith communities, including the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America in the Twin Cities and the United Methodist Church for Minnesota and the Dakotas, said they will not immediately return to in-person services.
Bishop Bruce Ough of the United Methodist Church for Minnesota and the Dakotas said he will continue to urge his 350 congregations in Minnesota to continue to livestream services.
“The best way we can heal the broken world is to do everything in our power to mitigate the impact of this virus,” Ough said.
The prospect of 250 people gathering outdoors to worship or for a wedding invites questions about restrictions on high school and college graduation ceremonies, Walz acknowledged. One difference is that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued updated safety guidance on Friday for houses of worship, the governor said, but not for other ceremonies.
And Walz stressed that just because a wedding ceremony can take place, that doesn’t mean the state is relaxing rules for post-ceremony gatherings.
“We’re talking about the ceremonies themselves,” Malcolm said, “and not the celebrations that typically accompany those ceremonies.”
The Minnesota Council of Churches issued a statement in support of congregations not yet ready to open, including those serving African-Americans, Latinos, American Indians, refugees and immigrants, and seniors.
Some faith communities, including the Hindu Society of Minnesota, greeted the governor’s announcement with cautious optimism. President Pooja Bastodkar said they have been strictly adhering to the governor’s rules. Now, a committee will determine next steps.
“No doubt there is a great sense of urgency and excitement in returning back to the temple, but we have to be very, very careful,” Bastodkar said."
"May 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/coronavirus-hit-meat-plants-just-as-workers-were-being-asked-to-speed-up/570758212/,StarTribune,Coronavirus hit meat plants just as workers were being asked to speed up,"The coronavirus began to spread through U.S. slaughterhouses this spring just when workers, already performing some of the most dangerous jobs anywhere, were being asked to take more risks by going faster.
Even as the outbreak began to force plants to temporarily close last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture continued granting permission to chicken processors to boost speeds by 25% on production lines. And the agency late last year approved an inspection system that would let pork plants abolish line-speed limits — now set at 1,106 hogs an hour — altogether.
With production reduced at many pork and chicken plants by the outbreak, there’s new scrutiny on the safety and procedures in them, including the line-speed changes that have been decades in the making.
“It was bad policy to begin with, but now I think it is irresponsible to do it — this is an infectious disease,” said Celeste Monforton, an occupational health and safety expert at Texas State University.
“Line speeds have an impact on how close the workers have to be,” she said. “You get to the point where you have to have more people on the line to keep up. And workers are already really close together.”
Companies and worker-safety advocates have long fought over proposals to increase line speeds, and the USDA’s primary concern in the matter is food safety, not worker safety.
Around 2000, the agency launched pilot programs to test new ways for the Food Safety and Inspection Service to oversee plants.
Meatpacking firms got to boost output, and the USDA shifted some basic inspection to company employees, arguing federal meat inspectors would be better deployed conducting lab tests and other “offline” inspection.
Eyeballing hunks of meat as they zip by on the line is not as important today as it was in the past, said Bill James, the former chief public health veterinarian at the USDA who helped craft the new inspection systems.
“The overwhelming cause of food-borne illness today is bacteria that we cannot see no matter how hard we look with the naked eye,” James said.
Testing the concept
Twenty poultry plants participated in one USDA pilot of line-speed increases and five hog slaughterhouses in another. One of those was Quality Pork Processors Inc., in Austin, Minn., which supplies meat to an adjacent Hormel Foods plant. The pilot hog plants had no maximum line speed limit, though the USDA maintains their average kill rate was a tad below the 1,106 mark.
The line speed at Quality Pork now stands at 1,300-plus hogs slaughtered per hour on average, said Richard Morgan, president of UFCW Local 9, which represents the plant’s workers.
With faster lines, more people are needed so workers don’t end up injured. “I’m not saying we haven’t had our screaming matches back and forth, but every time [Quality Pork] has increased the line speed, they have added more workers,” Morgan said.
The USDA has said it expects 40 “high-volume” hog plants representing 93% of the pork industry’s capacity to eventually adopt the new system.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW) believes the big JBS hog slaughterhouse in Worthington, the site of Minnesota’s largest workplace outbreak of the coronavirus, will be one of them.
The union filed suit in Minneapolis last fall to stop the USDA, saying it didn’t consider an “overwhelming record” that faster line speeds put workers at more risk of injury. JBS added coolers and expanded the kill floor and loading docks in Worthington, allowing it to increase line speed, the union said in the suit.
JBS said it does not intend to adopt the new inspection system in Worthington, but it declined to discuss the plant’s line speed.
Meat and poultry packers say there’s no conclusive evidence connecting higher line speeds and the spread of the coronavirus among workers.
At the JBS plant in Worthington, 680 of the plant’s 2,200 workers had tested positive for COVID-19 by the end of last week. One 66-year-old worker died in early May after contracting the virus.
In Quality Pork’s case, the slaughter plant in Austin and the Hormel factory next door each have had about a dozen confirmed cases of COVID-19, Morgan said.
David Michaels, a public health professor at George Washington University and head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from 2009 to 2017, said faster lines mean workers must be closer together, making them more susceptible to the virus. “The USDA is helping the meat industry turn their processing plants into human sacrifice zones,” he said.
The National Chicken Council said faster line speeds in chicken plants don’t lead to workers being closer together since key parts of those plants are heavily automated.
James, the former USDA veterinarian, said he thinks line speeds would have relatively less effect on illnesses than other conditions.
“Workers are close together in the changing rooms, they’re close together in the lunch room,” James said. “The plants are doing their best, but the bottom line is this is a labor-intensive industry.”
A USDA spokesman said no data supports the notion that faster lines have led to COVID-19 cases.
As for pork processors’ plans to adopt the new USDA line speed rules, “It’s hard to tell if COVID would make them pause,” Sarah Little, spokeswoman for the North American Meat Institute, said. “The pandemic doesn’t judge based on plant size or line speed.”
Meatpackers that were idled by COVID-19 outbreaks last month have reopened with fewer workers and slower lines.
The nation’s hog slaughterhouses were running about 80% of capacity last week. The JBS plant in Worthington ran at 75% “due to our policy of removing vulnerable populations, including anyone 60 years of age or older” and other measures, a company spokesman said.
Meanwhile, the USDA on March 20 stopped accepting new applications for increasing the line speeds at chicken plants. Its new poultry regulatory framework was rolled out in 2014, well before the swine plan, but with a key difference.
It restricted line speeds to 140 chickens per minute, even though the pilot program tested a pace of 175 birds per minute. In late 2018, the USDA began allowing the higher speed through waivers to plants; more than 30 have been granted, including 15 last month.
Pilgrim’s Pride, which is majority-owned by JBS, appears to have several chicken plants authorized to operate at 175 birds per minute, USDA records indicate. The Pilgrim’s Pride plant in Cold Spring — site of Minnesota’s second-largest workplace COVID-19 outbreak, involving 221 workers through last week — is not among them.
Repetition unrelenting
Animal slaughtering, not including poultry, had the second highest incidence of nonfatal occupational illness in 2018 after light-truck manufacturing, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Turkey processing was 14th.
In Minnesota, there were 65 occupational illnesses per 10,000 workers among animal slaughtering and processing workers in 2018, compared with 12 for all private industry.
Rotator cuff injuries, tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome are common. Those are repetitive-motion injuries that are only aggravated by faster line speeds, said Monforton, the safety expert at Texas State.
“The number one concern workers have, and the number one reason they attribute to the types of injuries they have, is the speed of the line,” she said. “They work at a relentless pace.”"
"May 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/poll-biden-has-small-lead-on-trump-in-minn/570709192/,StarTribune,Minnesota Poll: Biden holds small lead over Trump in 2020 presidential race,"Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a small lead over President Donald Trump among registered voters in Minnesota, according to the first presidential poll in the state since the Democrat clinched his party’s nomination.
A new Minnesota Poll conducted by the Star Tribune, MPR News and KARE 11 found Biden ahead of Trump 49% to 44% in the general election matchup less than six months ahead of Election Day. Biden fell just short of a majority, but 7% of Minnesotans said they are still undecided.
The poll also found that statewide, 53% of voters disapprove of the Republican incumbent’s job performance as president, compared with 45% who approve. Only 2% were undecided about Trump, reflecting a high degree of polarization heading into the fall election season.
Minnesota has emerged as a potential battleground state in November, with Trump and his re-election campaign invested in picking up the state’s 10 electoral votes after coming close in 2016. But Biden is coming off an unexpectedly strong win in Minnesota’s primary in March, and the last time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state was 1972.
The poll of 800 registered voters was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy from May 18-20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. It comes as the nation’s attention has been focused on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It also followed recent news reports of an allegation of long-ago sexual misconduct by Biden, which he has denied.
The poll found wide splits between men and women, different age groups and different regions of the state. Biden holds a wide lead in Hennepin and Ramsey counties and a smaller lead in other Twin Cities counties, while Trump holds healthy leads in both southern and northern Minnesota.
Women favor Biden and disapprove of Trump in big numbers. Trump’s advantage with men is not as pronounced but still considerable. Voters under 49 back Biden by big numbers, while Trump carries those 50 and over.
“I think the past three and a half years have been kind of a nightmare, honestly,” said Rachel Halliday, a 41-year-old family therapist from Minneapolis who was polled. “Biden wasn’t my top pick but I will be happy to vote for him for sure.”
Halliday said she’s never liked Trump but that his handling of the coronavirus pandemic heightened her sense of crisis. “Things feel dangerous at this point,” she said.
Doug Wilson, a 59-year-old publishing company vice president from Maple Grove, supports Trump but said he doesn’t always like the president’s style. But Wilson said his top priority is economic recovery, and he thinks Trump is better prepared to lead the U.S. out of its COVID-driven financial downturn.
“Who knows how long this pandemic is going to last?” Wilson said. “We can’t just keep throwing money at it. We have to figure out how, economically, we’re going to turn things in the other direction.”
A Minnesota Poll last October that matched Trump against four Democratic presidential contenders, including Biden, found the former vice president with a significantly larger lead over Trump than he has now.
But Biden’s level of support remains nearly unchanged from October: It’s Trump who gained ground in the new poll, especially with men, Minnesotans who live outside the Twin Cities, and voters over 65.
“I like where President Trump has taken us,” said Susan Pfeifer, 75, a retired small-business owner who lives in Park Rapids. “I dislike the way he is confronted and blocked on everything he wants to do. I think he has turned some people around with the way he has handled this pandemic. He is not using scare tactics to describe it.”
In contrast to Trump, Pfeifer said, she has not appreciated the tone of White House medical experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. “If we listen to them we are going to be under Communistic rule and China will own us,” Pfeifer said.
Al Drewes, a 75-year-old retired heavy equipment operator and construction welder from Detroit Lakes, is squarely for Biden. “I’m a union man, and in my lifetime, when the Democrats are in office, that was always when I was doing best in the dirt-moving business.”
But Drewes said he socializes regularly with his son and his son’s friends, men in their 50s. “They all like Trump,” he said. “They’re looking at their phone every five minutes to check their 401(k). I’ve learned it’s best for me not to talk about politics.”
The poll found Biden with a wide lead among Minnesotans who earn less than $50,000 a year, while Trump leads with those who make more. One of Biden’s biggest advantages is support among college graduates.
The poll also reinforces the sense of two political parties with increasingly little common ground. Few Democrats are backing Trump and few Republicans support Biden.
Independents in the poll were almost equally split between Trump and Biden, with almost 1 in 5 still undecided. Trump’s disapproval with independents also outpaced their approval, though not by as large a gap as with the overall sample of voters in the poll.
Biden’s hefty lead in Hennepin and Ramsey counties, and Trump’s continued advantage in rural parts of the state, suggests that voters in the outer ring suburbs and exurbs of the Twin Cities are poised to decide whether Minnesota backs four more years of Trump or helps put Biden in the White House."
"May 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-poll-majority-support-mailing-ballots-to-voters/570709272/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Minnesota Poll: Majority support mailing ballots to voters,"A majority of Minnesotans support a proposal to mail ballots to every registered voter in the state, a measure aimed at addressing fears that the coronavirus pandemic could stretch into Election Day.
The proposal by Secretary of State Steve Simon received a cool reception from Republicans in the Legislature and was not included in an elections bill signed by Gov. Tim Walz this month. It echoes a national debate over expanded voting by mail during the corona­virus pandemic, a move President Donald Trump has warned will encourage voter fraud.
Fifty-nine percent of people who participated in a Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll said they support the proposal, which would allow every registered voter in Minnesota to automatically receive a ballot by mail for the November elections; 37% were opposed, 4% were undecided.
The poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, surveyed 800 registered voters in Minnesota May 18-20.
The proposal had nearly universal — 97% — support among people who identify as DFLers. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans, meanwhile, oppose the idea. Men were roughly split on the proposal, while more than two-thirds of women said they support it. It also had higher support among voters younger than 34.
Voters now can cast a ballot by mail if they fill out an application. About a quarter of Minnesota voters in the 2018 midterms voted by mail, though more are expected to do so this year as people avoid crowded polling places. Simon’s proposal would mail ballots to every registered voter in the state.
“From a health standpoint … why take unnecessary risks?” said Minneapolis resident Joan Flaaten, a retired health care worker. “It just doesn’t make any sense.”
Flaaten said she typically votes in person because it is easy and she likes the excitement of being around people on Election Day. But given the coronavirus, she said, she would probably choose to cast her ballot by mail.
“Pandemic or not, I think everyone should have easy access to vote,” Flaaten said. “And the easiest way to do that is by mail.”
Advocates for mail-in voting argue that it is already deeply entrenched in American politics. Nationally, more than a quarter of ballots were cast by mail in 2018. Five states — Hawaii, Utah, Oregon, Washington and Colorado — will hold all-mail elections this year. And in 28 states and the District of Columbia, voters have the right to request a mail ballot without excuse. Voting by mail is also the standard way for members of the armed services to participate in elections.
But Cody Jacobson, an iron worker who lives in Buffalo, said the proposal would open the door to voter fraud. He noted the recent stories of federal stimulus checks being sent to dead people.
“You’re not going to get an honest election doing that, I don’t think,” Jacobson said.
He said the proposal could lead to family members voting on behalf of relatives in comas, for example, or people trying to buy other people’s ballots.
Simon has said he will continue to encourage Minnesotans to seek mail-in ballots."
"May 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/poll-walz-s-approval-ratings-grow-in-crisis/570709222/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Minnesota Poll: Gov. Tim Walz's approval ratings grow amid coronavirus response,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s approval rating has risen as the first-term governor navigates the coronavirus crisis, with 2 in 3 registered voters supporting his performance on the job, a Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll found.
The 65% approval rating is an increase from a Minnesota Poll conducted in February, weeks before the pandemic upended daily life and politics, leading to a series of executive actions temporarily closing businesses and limiting people’s movements. Before the crisis, 56% of registered voters approved of the DFL governor’s work.
But the share of Minnesota voters who disapprove of Walz’s job performance also has grown as the political debate intensifies about the state’s stay-at-home orders. In February, 25% of Minnesotans said they disapproved of his job as governor, compared to 30% in May, even as a majority of registered voters also voiced support for the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the virus.
Plymouth resident Cheri Rolnick has backed Walz since his 2018 run for office. She said his “top notch” response to the crisis has reinforced her support.
“I feel he was very quick to act and pay attention to the scientists,” she said. “I’m a retired epidemiologist, so science means a lot to me. Hunches mean very little.”
The telephone poll of 800 registered voters was conducted May 18-20, after the end of the statewide stay-at-home order and just as the governor was rolling out new rules allowing for some reopening of restaurants and salons. The poll, by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, has a margin of sampling error of 3.5%.
Walz’s latest decision allows restaurants and bars to open patios with up to 50 patrons as of June 1 and caps in-person gatherings to 10 people. Restaurateurs, some church leaders, Republicans in the Legislature and the state nurses union all have criticized various elements of the plan.
Under pressure from Catholic Church leaders and others, Walz modified his orders Saturday to allow places of worship to open at 25% occupancy starting Wednesday so long as they follow public health guidelines.
But while nearly a third of Minnesotans said his restrictions have gone too far, two-thirds said they are “about right” or haven’t gone far enough.
Gil Gehle, a commercial airlines pilot from Wayzata, shares concerns about the governor’s approach. Gehle, who leans conservative but sometimes votes for Democrats, said he didn’t think it was fair that large retailers such as Costco and Walmart “got different rules than the smaller people” when closures were first ordered. And he worries about the economic cost of the measures.
“My overall opinion on this is: He had to do what he had to do and listen to the medical experts, but I think he’s done a lot more harm overall economically and there’s a lot of lives that are ruined,” he said.
Even with those criticisms, Gehle, who voted for Republican gubernatorial nominee Jeff Johnson in 2018, said he still approves of the DFL governor’s overall job performance.
“I think his daily visibility on the news, giving us updates, has been helpful, calming everyone down,” he said. “He did a good job of conveying what he was doing and why he was doing it.”
Walz’s response to the virus, easily the biggest test of his current term, has faced the loudest criticism from GOP legislators and activists who have questioned his ongoing use of emergency powers, which are widely expected to be renewed on June 12. Several lawsuits have been filed challenging his actions, including one brought by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jason Lewis. Elected state Democrats have largely supported Walz’s actions.
The poll results reflect that deep partisan divide: 61% of Republicans disapprove of Walz’s performance, up from 51% in February, while 33% approve. Among Democrats, the governor’s approval ratings jump to 93%. Independent voters also approve of Walz’s work by a wide margin: 65% to 28%.
Although rural GOP lawmakers have been Walz’s loudest critics in the Legislature, the latest Minnesota Poll shows the governor winning support from a majority of voters across all regions. More than 60% of voters in northern Minnesota and the metro suburbs voiced approval, while nearly 3 of 4 in Hennepin and Ramsey County held favorable views. In southern Minnesota, a region that includes Walz’s former U.S. House district, 55% approve and 39% disapprove of his job performance.
Governors across the nation have attracted strong approval ratings in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, with state elected leaders on both sides of the political aisle largely outpolling President Donald Trump. The latest Minnesota Poll showed a similar dynamic, with Walz holding a 20-point favorability edge over the Republican president.
Walz, elected in 2018, is not on the ballot again until 2022. But his strong favorability rating could help him navigate the pandemic. University of Minnesota political scientist Kathryn Pearson said the results suggest voters are generally supporting Walz’s response and are more familiar with the governor than they were in February. While his approval numbers will likely dip as criticism from Republican leaders and others intensifies, Pearson said the high ratings could boost the governor both from a political and a public health standpoint.
“In general, these numbers are helpful for him as he continues to pursue a moderate, evidence-based strategy in consultation with scientists and health experts and others,” Pearson said."
"May 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-health-officials-call-for-caution-after-news-of-twin-cities-icu-beds-filling-up/570710842/?refresh=true,StarTribune,Minnesota health officials call for caution after news of Twin Cities ICU beds filling up,"Metro hospitals are running short on intensive care unit beds due to an increase in patients with COVID-19 and other medical issues, prompting health officials to call for more public adherence to social distancing to slow the spread of the infectious disease.
The Minnesota Department of Health on Friday reported a record 233 patients with COVID-19 in ICU beds, and hospital officials reported that 95% of ICU beds in the Twin Cities were filled by patients with COVID-19 or other unrelated medical conditions.
Patients with unrelated medical problems needed intensive care, along with patients recovering from surgeries — including elective procedures that resumed May 11 after they had been suspended due to the pandemic.
“We are tight,” said Dr. John Hick, an emergency physician directing Minnesota’s Statewide Healthcare Coordination Center. “Resuming elective surgeries plus an uptick in ICU cases has constricted things pretty quickly.”
At different times, Hennepin County Medical Center and North Memorial Health Hospital were diverting patients to other hospitals. Almost all heart-lung bypass machines were in use for severe COVID-19 patients and others at the University of Minnesota Medical Center and Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis.
As planned, Children’s Minnesota took on some young adult patients to take pressure off the general hospitals.
People might think the pandemic is over because public restrictions are being scaled back, but “in the hospitals, it is not over and it is not getting back to normal,” said nurse Emily Sippola, adding that her United Hospital was opening a third COVID-specific unit ahead of schedule. “The pace is picking up.”
The pressure on hospitals comes at a crossroads in Minnesota’s response to the pandemic, which is caused by a novel coronavirus for which there is yet no vaccine. Infections and deaths are rising even as Gov. Tim Walz lifted his statewide stay-at-home order on Monday and faced pressure this week to pull back even more restrictions on businesses and churches.
Despite talks with Walz on Friday, leaders of the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis issued no change in guidance for their churches to defy the governor’s order and hold indoor masses at one-third seating capacity starting Tuesday. President Donald Trump might have altered those talks when he threatened to supersede any state government that tried to keep churches closed any longer, although the White House didn’t cite any law giving him the right to do so.
A single-day record of 33 COVID-19 deaths was reported Friday in Minnesota — with 25 in long-term care and one in a behavioral health group home — raising the death toll to 842. Infections confirmed by diagnostic testing increased by 813 on Friday to 19,005 overall, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, called out Minneapolis for having one of the nation’s highest rates of diagnostic tests being positive for COVID-19.
People can slow the spread of COVID-19 if they continue to wear masks, practice social distancing, wash hands and cover coughs, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist.
“There are those among us who will not do well with this virus and will develop severe disease, and I think we need to be very mindful of that,” she said. “It’s not high-tech. We know what to do to prevent transmission of this virus.”
While as many as 80% of people suffer mild to moderate symptoms from infection, the virus spreads so easily that it will still lead to a high number of people needing hospital care. Health officials are particularly concerned about people with underlying health problems — including asthma, diabetes, smoking, and diseases of the heart, lungs, kidneys or immune system.
Individuals with such conditions and long-term care facility residents have made up around 98% of all deaths. The state’s total number of long-term care deaths related to COVID-19 is now 688.
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy estimates that only 5% of Minnesotans have been infected so far and that this rate will increase substantially.
Hospitals working together
Part of the state response strategy is aggressive testing of symptomatic patients to identify the course of the virus and hot spots of infection before they spread further. Widespread testing is being scheduled in long-term care facilities that have confirmed cases, and testing has taken place in eight food processing plants with cases as well.
The state averaged nearly 7,000 diagnostic tests per day this week, and the state should get a boost from a new campaign of testing clinics at six National Guard Armory locations across Minnesota from Saturday through Monday, said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner.
The state’s pandemic preparedness website as of Friday indicated that 1,045 of 1,257 available ICU beds were occupied by patients with COVID-19 or other unrelated medical conditions — and that another 1,093 beds could be readied within 72 hours.
Several hospitals are already activating those extra beds, though in some cases they are finding it difficult to find the critical care nurses to staff existing ICU beds — much less new ones, said Dr. Rahul Koranne, president of the Minnesota Hospital Association. Staffing difficulties, rather than a lack of physical bed space, caused some of the hospitals to divert patients.
Nurses in the Twin Cities reported being called in for overtime shifts for the Memorial Day weekend, which in typical years also launches a summerlong increase of car accidents and traumatic injuries. North Memorial, HCMC and Regions Hospital in St. Paul are trauma centers.
“This increased trauma volume typically persists throughout the summer season and into fall,” North Memorial said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Katy Sullivan. “To be able to provide the needed level of care for the community and honor our commitments to our healthcare partners throughout Minnesota and western Wisconsin, we need to preserve some capacity for emergency trauma care.”
An increase in surgeries might have contributed to the ICU burden, but Koranne said many didn’t fit the definition of elective. Some patients delayed the removal of tumors due to the pandemic but can no longer afford to do so.
“They are patients who have been waiting for critical time-sensitive procedures that their physician is worried might be getting worse,” Koranne said. “To call those type of procedures elective could not be further from the truth.”
Competing hospitals have long cooperated when others needed to divert patients, but that has increased with the help of the state COVID-19 coordinating center and is showing in how they are managing ICU bed shortages, hospital leaders said.
“We all have surge plans in place,” said Megan Remark, Regions president, “but more than ever before, everyone is working together and with the state to ensure that we can provide care for all patients.”"

Biden’s appearance, which will be streamed on YouTube and Facebook, comes on the heels of a new Minnesota Poll showing the former vice president with a slight edge over Trump.
But Trump’s campaign is already investing resources and time in Minnesota, a state he nearly won four years ago. DFL Party Chairman Ken Martin said Trump’s “failed response” to the COVID-19 pandemic has reminded state Democrats of the true stakes of the November election. “Our party is taking nothing for granted.”
Biden pulled off a surprise victory in Minnesota’s March 3 Democratic primary election, riding momentum from the endorsement of home-state Sen. Amy Klobuchar to beat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with more than 38% support.
Biden’s address will cap a weekend of party building and campaign training in the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic. The party will also be picking delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, which is now scheduled in August. The party moved its state convention online in response to the pandemic."

Commissioners withheld final approval on $26 million allocated to the county’s own emergency response costs, directing staff to seek board approval as that money is spent.
Commissioner Jim McDonough led the effort to delay approval of the final $26 million, saying the public needed “transparency and accountability.”
Under the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security) Act signed by President Donald Trump in March, Minnesota received $2.2 billion, which must be spent by year’s end.
The state government received the bulk of the funding, $1.87 billion, with Hennepin County getting $212 million and Ramsey $96 million. The state’s largest cities, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, didn’t receive a direct federal allotment and their leaders now are making a case for a share of the state’s emergency funds.
Ramsey County Manager Ryan O’Connor said the county’s plan strives to balance the need to quickly and equitably deploy money into the community while also ensuring accountability.
“There is a general fear, concern and distrust that government has not always thought of those most in need if we break it down on racial and ethnic lines,” O’Connor said.
To address those fears, the county is partnering with a host of community groups and nonprofits to ensure all racial and ethnic groups as well as women-led businesses and households have access to aid.
Under the plan, Ramsey County will spend about $15 million on rental and mortgage emergency assistance, noting that “housing stability is foundational for children’s health and family well-being.”
The county will spend $10 million on food assistance, including help for local nonprofits and school districts already distributing meals in the community.
The county has budgeted $15 million on workforce development to help a crush of job seekers. As of May 17, nearly 24% of Ramsey County’s labor force had applied for unemployment.
About $15 million will be directed toward small-business recovery, including millions in grants for struggling businesses that have 20 employees or fewer.
“Close to 70 percent of businesses in Ramsey County have fewer than 10 employees,” according to a county report.
Finally, the county is budgeting $40 million for its own emergency response costs: the opening of new facilities and renting hotel rooms for the homeless, purchase of personal protective equipment for staff and assistance for its health department. The board approved $14 million for emergency response, most of which has already been spent, and will approve the remaining $26 million as it’s spent."

They left without even pretending to tackle the next round of coronavirus relief.
This is how the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, wants it. Many Republicans, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are reluctant to embrace more government spending, so McConnell is taking a wait-and-see approach.
The Democratic-led House passed a $3 trillion relief package on May 15. That bill was imperfect but it was something. McConnell, on the other hand, has repeatedly said he’s in no hurry for the Senate to offer its own proposal. He has put talks on an indefinite pause, saying he wants to see how the economy responds to previous relief measures. The Senate may get around to putting together a plan when it reconvenes next month. Or perhaps it will in July.
This course of inaction is unsustainable. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, warned last week that the economic damage from the pandemic could stretch through the end of next year. Over the past nine weeks, new jobless claims have hit nearly 39 million, and the official unemployment rate is expected to approach 20% this month. Behind these numbers are real people suffering significant hardship. The Senate’s sluggish response in addressing this suffering has begun to discomfit even some of McConnell’s fellow Republicans.
“I think June doesn’t need to come and go without a phase four,” Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said last week, referring to the next round of aid.
Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine — both facing tough re-election races — have been especially eager to assure constituents that they take their pain seriously. “Congress has a tremendous responsibility to help mitigate the impact of this crisis on our states and our local communities and on the families they serve,” Collins said in a floor speech last week. “We must not wait. We should act now.”
Republicans should keep the pressure on McConnell and prepare to intensify their push for action when the Senate reconvenes.
The relief package passed by the House is a sprawling jumble of measures. It was not intended as a serious legislative blueprint so much as a maximal opening bid in a high-stakes negotiation. It includes everything from mandating masks on Amtrak trains to establishing new protections for inspectors general to funding environmental justice research.
There is plenty to like in the plan, including $875 billion in direct aid to hard-hit state and local governments, which are seeing revenue fall even as the demand for services skyrockets. But it is neither expansive nor creative enough to meet this moment.
With unemployment predicted to stay high through 2021, lawmakers need to do more to help those Americans whose jobs have vanished, many never to return."
"May 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/why-a-biden-victory-hinges-on-picking-the-right-running-mate/570772362/,StarTribune,Why a Biden victory hinges on picking the right running mate,"Do vice presidential picks matter? Conventional wisdom argues they have limited electoral impact.
But a vice presidential pick does matter in a particular way to elections. It suggests the strategy and tactics a campaign will pursue. The pick might complement the ticket, like Al Gore did for Bill Clinton in 1992, or the pick might balance the ticket, like Mike Pence did for Donald Trump.
So Joe Biden’s electoral fate may well hinge on this decision. In our polarized era, where turnout determines election victors and each party’s coalition has become more locked in, ticket-balancing picks for vice president can be helpful in mending primary wounds and generating excitement for the coalition in the general election.
That is why Biden should select for his running mate a ticket balancer.
Now, the temptation for Biden to pick a ticket “complementer” will be high. All the conventional wisdom suggests that ticket complementers “do no harm” because they are, essentially, prototypes of the presidential nominee.
By contrast, ticket balancers offer voters something the main nominee lacks and often are meant to motivate a group within the coalition with which the nominee has struggled to gain traction. Balancers are perceived to be riskier, especially since John McCain’s selection of Sarah Palin in 2008.
Hillary Clinton is often castigated as running a terrible, horrible, no good, doomed campaign. She actually ran a perfectly fine campaign — but strategically speaking, it was the wrong kind of campaign. It was based on the flawed assumption that a significant portion of American conservatives would not, simply could not, vote for Donald Trump.
But on Election Day, 90% of Republicans voted for him; Clinton also failed to carry independents, despite a campaign structured mostly on winning them over.
Clinton’s “do no harm” pick — Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia — ended up doing her considerable harm. The strategy built around the pick ended up leaving the party’s progressive flank vulnerable to, among other things, a sophisticated Russian propaganda and disinformation campaign.
In addition, so-called protest balloting in 2016 was three to five times higher than normal in the swing states. In states like Wisconsin, which was decided by less than a percentage point, nearly 6% of the electorate cast protest ballots. For all the attention placed on white, working-class voters and their continued realignment away from Democrats, protest balloting affected the outcome of every swing state contest and played a pivotal role in Trump’s destruction of the Democrat’s Midwest “blue wall.”
Yet Trump still has a plurality problem, and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, knows it. Even before the pandemic came along to destroy his best argument for re-election, the economy, Trump was unpopular among independents and has hardly ever (aside from a brief moment early in the coronavirus crisis) hit 50% approval rating nationally and rarely in swing states.
The only way to re-elect a plurality president is to make a plurality vote share sufficient enough to win. And the best way to do that is to replicate Russia’s playbook of targeting parts of the Democratic coalition — like progressives and young black voters — to turn them against voting for Biden.
The only person who has as much riding on Biden’s decision is Trump. As in 2016, he hopes to pick off or discourage disgruntled progressive voters. Much of Trump’s re-election hopes are pinned on Biden making the wrong choice of running mate.
So the Biden team must make a pick that can help Democrats match what promises to be an energized Republican base. The best way to do that is a ticket-balancing candidate like Stacey Abrams or Kamala Harris. They would bring gender and racial diversity to the ticket and, perhaps even more important, ideological diversity.
That might prove to be the single most effective way to head off the Trump campaign’s “divide and conquer” plan for progressives in 2020. With 120 million millennials and Generation Z potential voters now powering their coalition, Democrats would be wise to recognize that their electoral fate hinges on getting these voters to the polls. Biden is positioning himself as a bridge to the party’s future — and liberals like Harris and Abrams would help pave the way.
Another ticket-balancing approach would be to put a down payment on the Democratic Party’s geographic future. This approach would focus resources not as much on the Midwest but on Sun Belt states from California to Georgia through Texas, which could rise as a potential swing state as early as 2024. This would have the Biden team looking at Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Latina governor of New Mexico, or at Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada as potential running mates.
Biden’s nomination maxes out the ticket’s appeal to the center of the electorate. Among independents, the pandemic, economic collapse and Trump’s antics already provide Biden a hard edge. A centrist, ticket-complementing pick like Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will likely bring diminishing returns in this regard. As a fellow white moderate, Klobuchar is a quintessential ticket complementor — a 2020 version of Kaine.
If Biden is going to ignore the fact that today’s Democratic Party represents the most racially diverse coalition in America’s history, he should at least look to a ticket balancer like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who would bring ideological diversity and guarantee robust turnout and loyal support among progressives, many of whom are independents.
The special election last week in California’s 25th District shows Democrats are still vulnerable to low turnout; when their coalition fails to turn out, they lose. It also dispelled a dangerous myth — suburban Republicans are not casting ballots for Democrats. If Democrats want to hold on to or even expand on their House gains from 2018 and potentially take control of the Senate, they need an excited electorate.
Election outcomes in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona all come down to the same thing: the percentage of Democrats and left-leaning independents that end up casting ballots compared with the percentage of Republicans and right-leaning independents that do so. Republicans understand this campaign math and learned to solve this equation a long time ago. The only question is, have Democrats finally solved it too?"
"May 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/to-reopen-the-economy-businesses-need-a-safe-haven-protocol-to-avoid-liability/570815432/,StarTribune,"To reopen the economy, businesses need a 'safe haven' protocol to avoid liability","Several weeks ago many Amazon warehouse workers staged a call-out to demand increased protections against COVID-19. They want Amazon to shut down facilities where employees test positive and provide two weeks of paid leave, among other demands.
Elsewhere, the family of a Walmart employee who caught the virus at work has filed a wrongful-death suit against the retailer.
Businesses are struggling with how to operate during a pandemic. How can restaurants reopen and survive financially while not infecting their employees and customers? Can office employees come back to work, and what social distancing safeguards should they follow? Do factory assembly lines need to be redesigned?
How should the law respond to the choices businesses make in answering these questions?
Many employers fear that the threat of lawsuits will deter businesses from fully reopening. They have a point. Americans are litigious, and businesses already face huge uncertainties and costs. Republicans in Congress are demanding a liability waiver as part of the next stimulus bill.
Many unions, meanwhile, fear that employers will cut corners on safety in rushing back to business. They too have a point. Businesses face huge financial pressure, and managers do not have an encouraging history of solicitude for their employees' interests. Some Democrats are demanding that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issue an Emergency Temporary Standard imposing responsibilities on employers to guard against infection.
We need a way to reopen the economy while not unreasonably endangering workers. A compromise could address both concerns.
Congress could direct OSHA to issue a new standard. But rather than requiring all employers to follow that standard, the legislation would treat it as a safe harbor. Companies implementing the standard would be immune from liability should some employees become sick. Though not required, companies would have reason to adopt the standard. For companies that do adopt the standard, the threat of liability would diminish.
This compromise is worth adopting, but it has problems. If OSHA's standard is too demanding, companies won't adopt it. If it is too weak, it will allow companies to avoid liability without adequate safeguards. Businesses vary by industry, size, location, and a host of individual circumstances — one national standard that usefully addresses all those variations will be hard to craft.
There is a related approach that could do even better. A business would be immune from liability if it followed a virus safety plan approved by its employees. OSHA could still provide suggested guidelines, which companies and their employees could choose to adapt to the needs of the business. Other public health or industry groups could suggest alternative guidelines. The National Restaurant Association could adopt an employer-oriented set of guidelines for its industry, while the hospitality union UNITE HERE could propose more employee-protective guidelines. Individual firms could look to these examples in determining what safeguards would work best.
Safety plans for each workplace would allow more flexibility than one national standard. Approval by employees would give some assurance that the plans were not too weak. Guidelines from OSHA and others would help businesses and their employees be aware of relevant issues and options.
Employee involvement would help businesses craft better plans — employees know their workplace and can be a great source of ideas. Involving employees in adopting the plans would help ensure that they understand those plans and the reasons for them, making them more likely to effectively follow the plans.
For business owners, they would get a liability waiver, more thoughtful plans, and a chance to increase the loyalty and commitment of their employees. Since employees need to get back to work too, they share many common interests with owners.
If an owner feels her employees are making unreasonable demands, she can always choose not to use the safe harbor and reopen without an employee-approved plan. If one thinks that then puts employees in a hard position, we could add a further protection. If a company did not adopt a plan or the OSHA standard, employees could refuse to work and still get unemployment benefits if they think their workplace is unsafe.
Perhaps American businesses and Congress are not ready for this level of employee involvement. If so, an OSHA-generated safety standard that acts as a safe harbor against liability would be a big step. It is better than the business proposal to waive liability without complying with any standard, and better than the union proposal to impose a new standard on all businesses. Such a compromise could remove a main obstacle to the next coronavirus bill.
But imagine employees in Amazon warehouses or Walmart stores helping to craft safety plans that fit best with their workplaces. Businesses could continue or reopen without fear of liability, and workers would have a voice in protecting themselves. Going that extra step further would be worth it.

"May 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-has-an-executive-order-that-stops-evictions-here-s-how-it-works/570802722/,StarTribune,Minnesota has an executive order that stops evictions. Here's how it works.,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced a halt to evictions in March to prevent people from being unsheltered during the coronavirus pandemic. Public health officials and lawmakers have urged people to stay home as much as they can to curb the spread of the illness.
But tenants, landlords and homeowners alike have reached out to the Star Tribune with questions about how the eviction moratorium works and what rights people have amid the pandemic. Here are answers to some of those questions.
Q: When does the eviction moratorium end?
A: June 12. Why the middle of the month? It coincides with the expiration of Walz's peacetime emergency order. The governor could decide to extend it. If he does not, people can start filing actions in housing court as soon as June 15.
Q: Didn't the eviction moratorium end when Gov. Tim Walz eased stay-at-home restrictions?
A: The eviction moratorium is on a different timeline than the governor's stay-at-home order, which ended May 18.
Q: Does the moratorium mean people don't have to pay rent?
A: No. The executive order stopping evictions did not relieve people from having to pay their rent or mortgage each month. In fact, Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, lawmakers, tenant advocacy groups and landlords have continuously urged people to make rent and mortgage payments if they can or seek financial help that may be available to them if they cannot. The bottom line is: people still need to make their rent and mortgage payments.
Q: What if people can't pay their rent or mortgage right now?
A: It depends on each situation. Federal, state and local governments have programs to help people, including stimulus checks, rental assistance programs and enhanced unemployment benefits. But not everyone has received their federal stimulus check, and social service agencies have seen an influx of people applying for help.
Q: What do I do if my landlord or mortgage lender is trying to evict me now?
A: The attorney general's office has urged people to file a complaint so it can intervene. At the same time, residents are being encouraged to talk to their landlords about their situation. Homeowners are encouraged to call their mortgage lender to make arrangements.
Q: Does a landlord have any options for evicting a bad tenant?
A: Yes. Under the executive order, evictions are allowed in cases where a tenant seriously endangers the safety of other residents or violates other laws, such as bringing in controlled substances, engaging in prostitution or using or possessing firearms unlawfully. Unpaid rent, while financially unsettling, would not qualify as a reason to evict someone right now. But landlords can still file for an eviction if they think a tenant is endangering the safety of others, and tenants can be removed from the property if they lose in court. But tenants rights advocates say the burden of proof for landlords is still quite high.
Q: What about homeowners who can't pay their mortgage?
A: Homeowners are encouraged to call their mortgage lenders to see if they can put their payments into forbearance or work out other arrangements. The state's eviction moratorium covers homeowners who were about to be evicted after a foreclosure. Banks are being encouraged under the order to halt foreclosure proceedings, evictions and late fees for mortgage payments if the homeowner saw a decrease in income or an increase in medical expenses caused by COVID-19.
Q: What's going to happen when housing court opens again?
A: Tenant advocacy groups and the courts are bracing for a wave of eviction filings, between unpaid rents and landlords reporting tenant unruliness. While landlords have been trying to work out payment plans and help tenants access financial assistance and other social services like unemployment help and food assistance, landlords' livelihoods depend on rent checks."
"May 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/truly-scurrilous-behavior-by-scammers-increases-as-pandemic-continues/570797822/?refresh=true,StarTribune, Agencies say COVID-19 scams spreading,"The claim was at least unique. A Minnesota chiropractic practice said it had a way to help patients fight off COVID-19 infection.
No long after he heard about it, state Attorney General Keith Ellison sent a letter ordering the spine-adjusting business to stop advertising the coronavirus treatment or face court action.
Then he moved on to the next get-rich-quick scam.
Suspect cures and price gouging on scarce supplies have become a game of Whac-A-Mole for state and federal regulators and some businesses during the pandemic.
From Jan. 1 to May 18, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fielded more than 28,000 COVID-19 fraud claims. The FTC consumer blog now carries warnings about text-message scams involving COVID-19 contact tracing and what to do if your nursing home or assisted-living facility took your stimulus check.
The wave of unethical and potentially criminal business strategies spills over in the private sector. Minnesota-based 3M has filed 10 lawsuits trying to stop businesses from using its name to sell millions of overpriced or nonexistent N95 masks that filter 95% of coronavirus molecules.
Federal prosecutors announced criminal charges Tuesday in the first of those 10 lawsuits.
The government arrested New Jersey used-car salesman Ronald Romano for allegedly conspiring to charge desperate New York City officials 400% of the list price for millions of 3M masks that he had no access to and was not authorized to market.
Prosecutors said Romano fabricated a letter that said he had permission to sell 3M personal-protective equipment and lied about a sale of masks to a public agency in Florida to try to make his case.
The severity of the pandemic leads to many more acts of selflessness and humanitarianism than crime, Ellison said.
“But we have seen some truly scurrilous behavior. What are the scruples of someone who goes into Target, buys every roll of toilet paper and tries to sell it on eBay for $5 a roll?”
The unprecedented nature of the crisis gives some bad actors a way to excuse themselves, explained Katherina Pattit, who chairs the department of ethics and business law at University of St. Thomas’ Opus College of Business.
“An environment of ambiguity and uncertainty is a prime breeding ground for these behaviors,” she said.
People tend to do what others around them do. For instance, if no one else is throwing their trash on the ground, you tend not to litter. For most Americans, Pattit said, the current crisis is far “outside of any known range of behavior.”
In other words, where changed circumstances require new social and cultural norms, moral compasses can get skewed in all kinds of directions.
To combat exploitation, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas last week offered a bill that makes the FTC report “scams targeting seniors” during the pandemic and recommend ways to avoid such scams in future emergencies.
In early May, Klobuchar and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked the FTC to crack down on scams aimed at small businesses as they tried to get money through the Paycheck Protection Program.
The most prevalent coronavirus scam complaints in Minnesota center on websites selling products that never get delivered and sketchy COVID cures, Ellison said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warning letters to 54 companies for selling or promoting the sale of “fraudulent products with claims to prevent, treat, mitigate, diagnose or cure coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).”
The list includes everything from liquid dietary supplements infused with bits of silver to CBD, the pain-relief element in marijuana, to a coronavirus prevention nasal spray.
The companies receiving warning letters include marketers of holistic health cures, such as “essential oils” and herbal remedies, as well as the television show of televangelist Jim Bakker and the radio broadcast of right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
A wide range of people can convince themselves to trade on tragedy through a process called “moral disengagement,” said Michelle Duffy, chairwoman of the department of work and organizations at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management.
“While some people are more likely to disengage morally than others, the tendency is in all of us,” Duffy said. “And some situations can make this more likely to happen.”
A loss of control is one of those situations. Stay-at-home orders and other pandemic dictates took away control.
Duffy deconstructed attempts to trade on 3M’s name in selling face masks.
“First, we devalue people who are victims — basically dehumanize them — which then makes it OK to harm them,” she said. “Second, [people] can also reconstrue the harm they are doing into something else. Perhaps they think they are ‘morally justified’ because of some abstract concept like ‘organizational greed.’ The third way is to distort the consequences of what we do. Who got hurt here?”
Even presumably “good” people can succumb to a psychological mechanism called “moral licensing,” Pattit added.
“We’re being asked to make a lot of personal sacrifices,” she said. “So we allow ourselves more moral latitude in other areas.”
Still, believing some of the reported scams would actually work strains the imagination. Besides Romano’s alleged fraud, companies offered to sell public officials in Florida millions of N95 masks at two to five times the list price.
In Florida, the masks did not exist. That seller allegedly asked state officials for a hefty deposit in advance. In Indiana, an individual hoped to convince state officials he had access to 5 billion masks. In Wisconsin, another person asked state officials to sign a nondisclosure agreement that legally bound them to keep secret the source of a quarter-million overpriced masks.
Pattit likened the flood of pandemic fraud to the infamous e-mail scam of the “Nigerian prince” asking you to send him some seed money to unlock his vast wealth, which he would then share with you.
“It was outrageous, but there were always a few who fell for it,” Pattit said.
In the same way, COVID-19 scams “hit on desperate people,” Pattit said. “When you have desperation, [some people] are willing to bypass their common sense.”"
"May 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/protests-could-trigger-virus-surge-in-minnesota-as-deaths-hit-new-high/570844542/,StarTribune,Protests could trigger virus surge in Minnesota as deaths hit new high,"Health officials warned Thursday that mass protests over police brutality could exacerbate the spread of COVID-19 in Minnesota and trigger a surge in an outbreak that has had a disproportionate impact on minorities.
State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said it is understandable that people are protesting and speaking out following the death of a black man forcibly restrained by a white police officer, but that doesn't lessen the exposure risks from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 at a pivotal time in the pandemic.
The state reported a single-day record of 35 deaths on Thursday from COVID-19, raising the death toll to 967.
""People are moved to want to speak and to want to gather in solidarity and in protest, and we certainly honor and respect that right,"" Malcolm said. ""As we know, large gatherings do pose a risk in any epidemic, but certainly where we stand today with the state of COVID-19 spread in our community. Knowing that we have community spread, we just want to again encourage folks who gather to be mindful of the risk.""
The 493 lab-confirmed cases that were reported Thursday represented a fifth straight decline in daily counts of new cases, Malcolm said, raising hope that the COVID-19 pandemic that has plateaued in other states is leveling off here as well. On the other hand, the state reported 606 people were hospitalized for COVID-19, including 242 needing intensive care, and officials remain concerned that the pandemic could exhaust the state's bed capacity.
Minnesota is among 20 states — including Wisconsin and North Dakota — now listed on the COVID Exit Strategy website as ""trending poorly"" due to rising case counts and hospital utilization.
Malcolm said Minnesotans slowed the rate of COVID-19 growth through their adherence to social distancing recommendations — such as staying 6 feet from others in public — and a 51-day stay-at-home order that ended May 18. That delayed the peak of the pandemic, which Minnesota has yet to reach despite the recent plateau in diagnosed cases, Malcolm said.
""We believe we are still climbing the curve,"" she said.
Scattershot concern
COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus that has produced confirmed cases in all but remote Lake of the Woods and Cook counties in northern Minnesota.
Minnesota had been gradually scaling back restrictions — with churches being able to offer services for up to 250 people or 25% of their capacities, and restaurants and bars being allowed to resume outdoor dining service beginning Monday.
Protests this week showed scattershot concern for such restrictions, or for social distancing recommendations to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart so as not to spread germs.
At the first protest Tuesday, at E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, people spread out in groups per social distancing recommendations, with many clapping or raising their fists instead of talking. Later that same evening, though, some angry protesters pulled down their masks, shouted, and ran in packs after police SUVs.
Looters shattered glass and stole goods from a Minneapolis Target overnight Wednesday, though some kept their masks on.
The pandemic has been harshest on long-term care residents, who make up 787 of the state's COVID-19 deaths, and on people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and diseases of the heart, lungs, kidneys or immune system. But available racial data suggest it has been hard on Minnesota's black community, too.
Black people have contracted at least 29% of the known COVID-19 cases with listed racial information in Minnesota, despite making up a little more than 6% of the state's population. (The state does not have racial data on more than 5,000 cases, though.) An initial state health analysis of the first 1,104 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Minnesota also showed that nearly 25% with known race data were black.
Chronic disease rates are higher in black Minnesotans, which compounds their COVID-19 risks, and Dr. Penny Wheeler of Allina Health said such racial inequities need to be confronted.
""Communities of color are facing multiple devastations with disproportionate financial and health impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the ongoing trauma of deeply entrenched racial bias,"" said Wheeler, Allina's chief executive.
Record testing day
The state reported 8,676 COVID-19 diagnostic tests were completed by public and private labs on Wednesday — also a single-day record.
Results continue to show the increasing risk of COVID-19 by age. Among the 1,171 cases involving people in their 80s, 331 were fatal.
Only six deaths have been reported by comparison among 4,580 confirmed cases among Minnesotans in their 30s. Malcolm cautioned that deaths of two people in their 30s and 40s were reported Thursday and did not seem to involve any underlying health conditions.
The death figures bring Minnesota closer to Gov. Tim Walz's prediction of 1,000 deaths by the end of May, but below estimates of 1,400 to 1,700 deaths that came from data modeling by researchers at the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Health.
Those estimates were based on conditions in Minnesota as of late April, when the rate of change in COVID-19 deaths was steeper. Health officials stressed that the modeling is not designed to precisely estimate the impact of the pandemic, but rather to evaluate what social policies and restrictions might be most effective.
The COVID-19 case count in Minnesota now includes 2,549 health care workers — a number that is influenced in part by heightened monitoring and testing in this population.
The state last week reported that 140 of those workers were likely infected due to medium- or high-risk exposures on their jobs — either when they weren't wearing masks or other protections around patients or residents who had COVID-19, or their protective gear broke or was contaminated.
Of that group, 16 required hospital care and one died. Six in 10 of those cases involved workers in long-term care or assisted-living facilities. Roughly 2 in 10 involved workers at medical clinics or hospitals or other acute care facilities."
"May 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/focus-on-public-health-not-political-conventions/570880242/,StarTribune,"Focus on public health, not political conventions","In a normal year and under normal circumstances, we believe Dallas would greatly appreciate all the extra commerce a national political convention could bring to this city.
So when the President Donald Trump made noises in recent days about possibly pulling the Republican National Convention out of North Carolina in the midst of a political spat with the state’s Democratic governor and plopping it in Texas or another state, we admit to cracking a smile. Of course, Texas should always be in the running for a business opportunity.
What’s sitting before the country, however, is more important than a business opportunity for a city in Texas or some other state. The president’s comments stem from a divisive and increasingly politicized debate about how we should continue to respond to the coronavirus. And we believe that the manner in which that debate is playing out is particularly dangerous during a national crisis.
Lest we forget, we are now some three months into the pandemic rolling across the United States. It’s estimated that about 100,000 people have died from the virus, and it is clear that we don’t yet have a handle on how many people have actually contracted it. Only blood tests of a wide swath of the population will show us the true reach of the disease. What we do know is that in facing the uncertainty of this new virus, we’ve embarked on a massive campaign to first shut down large sections of the economy and now slowly open up.
It was always going to be true that we would have passionate and even heated debates about what the proper approach to addressing the pandemic should be. After all, deciding on our next steps involves making decisions about people’s health and their ability to support themselves, all of which is why leadership is particularly crucial right now.
Americans need to see that decisions about their health and about their ability to return to work are being driven by nonpartisan analysis. Capitalism often gets tagged with being driven by greed, but in fact a market economy is powered by trust. That’s often true for small things, such as whether the cashier has given us the correct change.
And it’s true for larger things such as whether a company has taken proper steps to protect our health. Regulations and general law enforcement exist to police bad actors, but our society has thrived because most Americans can rightly trust that most of the rest of us in this free society are acting in good faith.
If, instead, we devolve into political warfare about basic decisions about how we will deal with ongoing issues created by the coronavirus, that trust will evaporate. If the public comes to believe that where the president places his party’s convention during a pandemic has more to do with politics than health, the president will undercut the sense of trust we all need to beat this virus and rebuild the economy.
Texas pride alone should lead us to reject being made into a pawn in such a game. So trust us, if you will. What we need most is good leadership that reasonable people see as acting in good faith, regardless of where the convention is held."
"May 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/pandemic-s-end-depends-on-what-definition-you-use/570864502/,StarTribune,Pandemic's end depends on what definition you use,"When will the COVID-19 pandemic end? It depends on how you define end.
According to historians, pandemics typically have two types of endings: the medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes.
In other words, an end can occur not because a disease has been vanquished but because people grow tired of panic mode and learn to live with a disease.
“When people ask, ‘When will this end?,’ they are asking about the social ending,” said Dr. Jeremy Greene, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.
Allan Brandt, a Harvard historian, said something similar is happening with COVID-19: “As we have seen in the debate about opening the economy, many questions about the so-called end are determined not by medical and public health data but by sociopolitical processes.”
Bubonic plague has struck several times, once in the sixth century, again in the 14th century and a pandemic that struck in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It died down, but it never really went away. In the United States, infections are endemic among prairie dogs in the Southwest and can be transmitted to people by fleas that carry the microbe. But such cases are rare and now can be successfully treated with antibiotics.
Among the diseases to have achieved a medical end is smallpox. But it is exceptional for several reasons: There is a vaccine; the virus, Variola minor, has no animal host, so eliminating the disease in humans meant total elimination, and its symptoms are so unusual that infection is obvious, allowing for contact tracing.
The 1918 flu is held up today as the example of the ravages of a pandemic and the value of quarantines and social distancing. The flu killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide, preying on young to middle-aged adults. After sweeping through the world, it faded away, although experts aren’t sure why.
“Maybe it was like a fire that, having burned the available and easily accessible wood, burns down,” Yale historian Frank Snowden said.
Other flu pandemics followed — none so bad, but all nonetheless sobering. In the Hong Kong flu of 1968, 100,000 people in the United States died. That virus still circulates as a seasonal flu, but the fear that went with it is rarely recalled.
Will that happen with COVID-19?
One possibility, historians say, is that the coronavirus pandemic could end socially before it ends medically. People may grow so tired of the restrictions that they declare the pandemic over before a vaccine or effective treatment is found.
“I think there is this sort of social psychological issue of exhaustion and frustration,” Yale historian Naomi Rogers said. “We may be in a moment when people are just saying, ‘That’s enough.’ ”"
"May 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/pandemic-downturn-could-force-hundreds-of-colleges-to-close/570868072/,StarTribune,"Pandemic, downturn could force hundreds of colleges to close","Martyna Malecka, a criminology student at Stonehill College, can't wait for classes to restart in August. Her campus in Easton, Mass., ""feels like a village."" She judges time spent there less of a coronavirus risk than staying at home in Chicago.
Universities everywhere have made valiant efforts to function remotely. A few, such as California State University, said they will continue teaching only online next year.
Whether or not universities get back quickly, many are likely to suffer. Stonehill is private and Catholic, with 2,500 students and a $200 million endowment. It looks in good shape, but many similar liberal arts colleges, especially in the northeast and Midwest, are not.
Their problems are long-standing. Nathan Grawe of Carleton College in Northfield, who researches demography and higher education, said the core difficulty is the slipping fertility rate. Overall enrollment has fallen over the past few years.
This squeezes smaller colleges hardest. A study by EY-Parthenon, an education consultancy, of more than 2,000 colleges suggested 800 are so small or inefficient that they may go bust. Around one-fifth run budget deficits. Others pile up debts, fail to build sufficient endowments or sustain student numbers only by agreeing to painfully big discounts on fees. Grawe points out that eight colleges were already closing each year before the pandemic.
Those that fail are usually small, among the 40% of higher-education institutions with fewer than 1,000 students. In the past decade these have seen enrollments slip faster than medium-size ones. Of the 72 colleges EY-Parthenon found had shut since 2007, almost every one was small. They are vulnerable because they depend most on revenue from students; others find ways to hire out campuses for conferences, raise research money, earn bequests and the like.
Robert Zemsky of the University of Pennsylvania, who co-wrote a recent book on the growing woes of universities, expects a ""collapse, lots of closures"" of smaller colleges, notably in the Midwest. He blames both demography and teaching methods that do not suit some students, noting how, at many universities, more than a quarter of freshmen quit in their first year. Curricula, he said, are outdated, faculty members are out of touch and four-year degrees should be cut to three to save costs and force a rethink of higher education.
Among the most vulnerable colleges are those that cater mostly to nonwhite students. ""African-Americans are more than two times as likely to attend an institution at risk, compared with whites and Hispanics,"" he said. Crystal Nix-Hines, a lawyer in Los Angeles who specializes in the education sector, also expects an ""enormous winnowing"" of historically black colleges.
Consolidation of higher education is overdue. Students increasingly prefer bigger and more urban institutions, so some smaller, rural ones will go. How many? Just before the pandemic, Zemsky and his co-authors suggested that 10% of colleges would eventually close. He now expects 20% to shut or merge with others.
The pandemic further dims their prospects. Efforts to recruit foreign students, who typically pay full fees, have slid for each of the past three years. Travel bans and concern that the U.S. has bungled the coronavirus will only put off more.
The economic slump means some poorer families will not send youngsters to study. Others will delay. Funding from states for public universities is certain to fall.
Finally, many universities face legal trouble. Nix-Hines counted 134 lawsuits, mostly class-action ones, against colleges as students sought the return of tuition fees."
"May 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-ramps-up-covid-19-testing-in-nursing-homes/570878342/,StarTribune,Minnesota ramps up COVID-19 testing in nursing homes,"As COVID-19 deaths continue to rise in nursing homes, state health officials are ramping up efforts to test everyone who lives and works in facilities with outbreaks of the deadly virus.
In response to growing public pressure, teams made up of public health personnel and the Minnesota National Guard have been deployed across the state to facilitate comprehensive testing in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. As a result, more than 10,000 residents and staff at about 40 long-term care communities have undergone coronavirus testing in the past few weeks, and dozens more facilities are scheduled to launch testing by mid-June, according to state data released this week.
The dramatic expansion of testing is part of a broader strategy unveiled early this month by the administration of Gov. Tim Walz to address the devastating death rate in Minnesota’s long-term care communities, which account for 81% of the deaths from COVID-19, the deadly respiratory illness caused by the virus. While criticized by some as inadequate, the ramped-up testing is expected to offer a clearer view of how far the virus has spread in these homes and help alleviate widespread anxiety among vulnerable residents and families.
The demand for COVID-19 testing among senior living communities has soared as the pandemic has tightened its grip on a vulnerable population. Large and deadly clusters of the virus have shaken care centers across the state, from Winona to Duluth. All told, about 470 nursing homes and assisted-living facilities have requested state assistance with COVID-19 testing; another 134 facilities have begun testing on their own, according to the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) in St. Paul.
“What testing allows you to do is have a sight picture and be able to trace and isolate and make sure they do not spread [the virus] to others,” Walz said at a news conference this month announcing the expanded testing.
The Walz administration had come under sharp criticism from some lawmakers and elder-care advocates for not doing enough to support testing in long-term care homes. For months, senior homes were testing residents and staff only if they had high temperatures or other symptoms, though research shows that asymptomatic people can spread the virus without being aware they are infected.
Many senior homes lacked access to testing materials or could not find private labs to handle the volume of tests they were seeking, say representatives of the long-term care industry.
Even with the expanded efforts, the testing is still seen by some as inadequate and lacking in clear guidelines.
So far, the testing in long-term care communities has been voluntary — meaning providers themselves have chosen whether to pursue testing. However, the state has provided support to certain senior homes that request it, prioritizing those with recent outbreaks of the virus. In the past two weeks, the Minnesota National Guard has helped conduct tests at 26 facilities; another 30 facilities are scheduled for tests in the next two weeks, the SEOC said.
Sen. Karin Housley, R-St. Mary’s Point, chairwoman of the Senate Family Care and Aging Committee, said that many long-term care providers have struggled to implement facilitywide testing because they aren’t sure how to pay for it. In many cases, she said, staff at nursing homes are being asked to get COVID-19 tests on their own and then have their insurance plans cover the cost. Some staff are paying out-of-pocket costs and are concerned their insurance premiums will go up if they get tested, she said.
Housley has argued that weekly, on-site testing should be offered at all 1,700 long-term care facilities across the state. She is preparing legislation that would mandate the state to pay for the testing with the $1.87 billion in federal funds Minnesota has received to cover corona­virus-related costs. Such testing among senior care residents should take priority over the sort of free tests that were offered earlier this month at National Guard Armory locations across the state, Housley said.
“This virus is running rampant in our long-term care communities. But instead of testing staff and residents of those facilities where people are dying, we are offering free tests to members of the public who show no symptoms at all,” she said. “It makes no sense.”
Anxiety and confusion around coronavirus testing remains widespread in senior living communities.
Cheryl Hennen, Minnesota’s long-term care ombudsman, said her office has received nearly 400 calls in the past month concerning COVID-19. Between 60 and 75% of the calls are from senior care residents or their families, asking questions about testing. Many of the questions surround when testing will occur, why testing has taken so long to administer, and what happens if they test positive for the virus, she said.
“People have been living with a lot of ambiguity and want some assurance they are safe,” Hennen said. “Without having a test, you have no idea of whether you have the virus — and whether or not people caring for you have it.”
For many families, the arrival of more testing has brought an end to weeks or months of anxiety over whether their loved ones have the illness.
Lynne Powers of Excelsior said she had been pushing for COVID-19 testing of her 82-year-old mother, who has Alzheimer’s disease and lives at a nursing home, since early April. Her pleas intensified after some residents on her mother’s memory-care unit tested positive for the illness.
On May 14, Powers finally got word that her mother had been tested and did not have the virus. She is awaiting the results of a follow-up test conducted this week.
“In my opinion, testing in long-term care should have been a focus from the beginning” of the pandemic, she said. “It relieves so much stress just knowing my mom is OK.”"
"May 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/virus-creates-new-layer-of-risk-for-opioid-addicts/570884652/,StarTribune,Coronavirus creates new layer of risk for opioid addicts,"Chris Knutson couldn’t stop fidgeting with his mask. After a few more tugs, he gave up and went back to passing out the overdose antidote naloxone at a homeless encampment on Minneapolis’ South Side.
He hadn’t set out to do drug intervention work. After joining St. Stephen’s Human Services, a local housing advocacy group, he’d mostly sat behind the desk the past few years, helping people through the tedious process of applying for affordable housing.
Then COVID-19 struck. Almost overnight, the problem for many people of finding a roof to sleep under was overtaken by other anxieties.
“The whole goal of outreach has shifted, where it used to be building relationships with people,” he said. “Now, we’re trying to keep people safe.”
Knutson and others from St. Stephen’s outreach team spend their days handing out vials of naloxone and clean syringes, as well as food, toiletries and other necessities. Though the agency is still working to end homelessness, Knutson said it also saw a chance to help those caught between the pandemic and the ongoing opioid crisis.
The new focus on drug outreach reflects COVID-19’s devastating impact on the city’s unsheltered population. St. Stephen’s is part of a grassroots movement taking shape in long-neglected parts of the city where a lack of access to health care, jobs and adequate housing made residents vulnerable even before the pandemic.
“The permanent solutions that people need are just not there,” says Knutson. “It doesn’t have to be this way — this is a job that will turn you against capitalism.”
He continued, growing frustrated: “There’s tents everywhere, there’s luxury condos everywhere, and we’re just going around looking at both every day.”
After watching as heroin and prescription drug abuse ravaged the Rust Belt and Appalachia for much of the past decade, Minneapolis is now feeling the full brunt of the opioid epidemic. Things have only gotten worse with COVID-19. The city has recorded more suspected drug overdoses since the pandemic arrived here in late March than compared to the same period last year. Even before then, the city was already on pace to easily surpass 2019’s tally of 1,499.
Fran Evenson, another St. Stephen’s worker, said that their work has taken on new importance during the pandemic, which health officials worry may lead to an increase in addiction rates, as more people find themselves overwhelmed with taking care of their households and earning a living while struggling with feelings of isolation.
As a result, St. Stephen’s and other outreach groups like Southside Harm Reduction are making renewed efforts to slow the opioid epidemic’s spread in some of the city’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods. There are also increasing efforts to bring medical care to the poor, rather than make them travel to the already overburdened treatment facilities. In Phillips and other neighborhoods hit hard by the epidemic, advocates aren’t waiting for help from the city. They have formed an underground supply network to help people struggling with addiction but who don’t have access to drug treatment. Some of these outreach workers are finding that they must contend with City Hall and the police, who are wary of their harm reduction approach.
Evenson, who started at St. Stephen’s after Knutson, said the program largely relies on donations, but that they pay for some supplies out of their own pockets. They buy plastic spray bottles from a dollar store and fill them with hand sanitizer, telling everyone who gets one to hang on to the bottles.
Knutson says their outreach focuses on two causes that have always been intertwined: homelessness and substance abuse.
“If you’re using, it’s going to be hard for you to maintain your housing and to keep your job and all that,” Knutson said.
A recent afternoon found the pair visiting a ramshackle encampment across the street from the former Navigation Center. They announce themselves before poking their heads into one of the tents. A woman emerges, and they ask whether she needs clean needles. “No,” she responded while sizing them up. Too often the needles end up in the grass, creating a safety hazard for children. The pair make their rounds about three days of the week. Some faces they recognize from their housing-assistance work, and they try to learn the names and needs of newcomers as a way of establishing trust.
Some of the people they encounter have cycled in and out of treatment programs. Many also struggle with mental health. Besides doing outreach, Evenson says, the job is also about educating people who have gotten used to living largely disconnected from the world. But word about the dangers of the virus seems to be getting out. People huddle around Evenson and Knutson, asking for hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes and masks. They shout their gratitude and promise to share the supplies.
Complicating matters is the added threat of contracting the virus, says Knutson, who wears masks and gloves and wipes down the SUV with Clorox wipes before and after every shift.
“You just have to tell people to back up, and how interested people are in that varies,” Knutson says later. “We’re also wearing the masks now, which can be very alienating.”
Besides growing social isolation, the coronavirus epidemic has cut off users from treatment programs. Some are being turned away from hospitals and clinics already suffering from a shortage of beds. Others are avoiding medical settings altogether out of fear of getting infected. But the encampments themselves are vulnerable to an outbreak, with people packed together with not enough masks, soap or hand sanitizer.
“Can you keep back six feet?” Knutson asks, to little avail. Some residents scramble to get out of the way as a backhoe rumbles past. A man, wearing a white thermal shirt and a thin beard, wanders over and sheepishly asks for “rigs,” as clean needles are called. Evenson responds that they’re out but will return the following day with more, and asks the man whether he needed any naloxone.
Since the pandemic started, a certain “compassion fatigue” has set in, says Evenson, with more people focusing inward, on their own families: “We’re not seeing the same level of donations.”
He sees the work as offering a lifeline to communities still facing steep disparities in access to health care, jobs and adequate housing. Many have cycled in and out of homeless shelters and treatment facilities. Because of COVID-19, there’s a “growing aversion” to shelters, he said.
Knutson moved to the Twin Cities from Cincinnati with no clear idea of what he wanted to do, taking a job at Half Price Books and delivering newspapers on the weekends. Then he applied at St. Stephen’s.Evenson also felt drawn to social issues. He lost his job in 2008 during the financial crisis and was homeless for six months before enrolling in Metropolitan State University, where he studied sociology. Knutson sees their work as important, but ultimately as a Band-Aid. He hopes to soon get back to doing his previous work of getting unsheltered people into permanent housing.
“That would be very depressing if our job was no longer as housing focused as it was in the past,” Knutson said. “This was already a problem; it’s not like homelessness changed for the better with what’s going on.”"
"May 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/did-coronavirus-reach-minnesota-earlier-than-we-thought/570878612/,StarTribune,Did coronavirus reach Minnesota earlier than we thought?,"Exhausted Minnesotans are anxious to know when the COVID-19 pandemic will end in their state, but another vital question remains:
When did this whole thing begin?
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday that COVID-19 was likely spreading in some pockets of the country in January or early February — before the nation’s first community-acquired infection was detected on Feb. 27 in Washington state.
A University of Minnesota researcher similarly is out to establish whether the virus had already reached Minnesota by that time. On Saturday, it is expected the state will surpass more than 1,000 COVID-19 deaths and 24,000 known illnesses.
The U’s Dr. Mark Schleiss said he can’t ignore the patients with mysterious ailments he treated in early 2020 — including those with loss of smell and taste that has become a hallmark symptom of COVID-19.
“Anybody who has a bad cold has an altered sense of smell ... but it’s another thing to just sort of have that sense vanish,” said Schleiss, a pediatrician and molecular virologist. “My hunch is the virus was circulating at least in February but possibly in January.”
Schleiss’ research also could address how the virus affects children, including its potential role in a newly discovered Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome in Children.
The Minnesota Department of Health on Friday confirmed two such cases in children, both of whom are hospitalized. Most children recover, but some cases mimic toxic shock syndrome and cause rashes, digestion troubles and problems with organs.
Nearly three months after reporting its first COVID-19 case, Minnesota as of Friday reported a total of 23,531 lab-confirmed cases as well as 996 deaths from the respiratory disease that is caused by a novel coronavirus. The number of patients needing hospitalization for COVID-19 reached 592 on Friday, and included 259 patients who needed intensive care.
Confirmation of another 590 cases of COVID-19 in Minnesota on Friday halted a five-day run in which the state’s daily case count had been declining.
State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said that social distancing efforts and a recent stay-at-home order slowed the growth of the pandemic in Minnesota, which is why its peak is still to come while other states are already reporting declining case numbers.
Malcolm warned in a statement Friday that Minnesota is at a vulnerable point, particularly with so much person-to-person interaction and people arriving from other states to join protests over the Memorial Day death of George Floyd while he was being restrained by police.
“The Twin Cities remain a hot spot for COVID-19 spread,” she wrote. “In fact, nationwide, we are one of the communities most vulnerable to rapid increases in the spread of the virus, given where we are in the course of the epidemic.”
Searching for clues
An earlier presence of the virus in Minnesota could have undermined initial efforts to slow its introduction. In February, state health officials primarily advised Minnesotans to stock up on supplies if they needed to be quarantined, and to avoid the spread of germs by washing hands and covering coughs.
The state’s first case in an elderly Ramsey County individual was reported March 6.
Schleiss is addressing that question through repurposing specimens he has been collecting from newborns of consenting families for a study of the cytomegalovirus — a common cause of birth defects.
Gaining permission to look at samples of babies born as far back as November 2019, Schleiss this week started conducting diagnostic testing to see how many had any trace of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2019.
“It could give us clues as to how the virus has worked its way around the world,” he said.
The study is one of 59 funded by U mini-grants to examine the pandemic. Other studies using this funding sought to develop a low-cost emergency ventilator, assess how COVID-19 affects cancer outcomes, and examine whether social media could be used to rapidly implement social distancing and pandemic response strategies.
The U also launched one of the first randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine to see if the existing malaria drug could treat COVID-19 cases or prevent symptoms in people exposed to the virus. Publication of the U’s trial results is expected in the next week or so.
The CDC report concluded an earlier-than-known community spread of the corona­virus in the U.S. based on analysis of four data sets — including emergency department records from counties with some of the first known COVID-19 cases — to see if patients had been coming in earlier with similar symptoms that hadn’t been recognized.
Schleiss said his research could identify not just the timing of COVID-19’s arrival in Minnesota, but also the subtype of the coronavirus that was involved in early infections.
Studies suggest that initial West Coast cases came from a viral strain that emerged in Wuhan, China, but that the East Coast surge might have started with a genetic variant that had spread widely in Europe.
COVID-19 has been harshest on the elderly — with Minnesotans 70 and older suffering 13% of the known cases so far but 82% of the deaths. Among all deaths, 811 involved residents of long-term care or assisted-living facilities.
Among 6,312 known cases of Minnesotans 29 and younger, none have died. Six people in their 30s in Minnesota have died from COVID-19, including someone this week with no other apparent health problems.
Identifying the virus in newborn samples could add to an understanding of how it affects children differently, Schleiss said, and how it contributes to the new and mysterious multiorgan syndrome.
“The question of what is going on in the newborn infants,” he said, “is unresolved.”"
"May 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/interest-rate-on-federal-college-loans-is-about-to-hit-a-record-low/570852532/,StarTribune,Interest rate on federal college loans is about to hit a record low,"The coronavirus may be upending the way colleges operate, but at least students and their families will get a break if they borrow money from the government for an education.
The interest rate on new federal student loans for undergraduates will fall to a record low this summer. Those students will pay a rate of 2.75% on loans for the coming academic year, down from 4.53% last year. It has been 15 years since rates near that low were available, according to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Savingforcollege.com.
Over a 10-year repayment period, the new rate will save borrowers about $1,000 for each $10,000 borrowed, Kantrowitz calculated.
Rates for other types of loans fell, too, although not to record lows. The rate for graduate students will fall to 4.3%, from 6.08%, for instance. The rates take effect July 1 for new loans borrowed for the 2020-21 academic year and remain fixed for the life of the loan.
The federal government hasn’t formally announced the rates, but Kantrowitz calculated them using the formula adopted by Congress. Since 2013, rates on student loans have been set each spring.
Students, however, may be wondering whether it is worth borrowing to attend college if classes this fall are all or mostly online. Some colleges are considering switching primarily to remote learning for the semester because of the coronavirus.
While acknowledging the uncertainty, Jessica Thompson, at the nonprofit research group Institute for College Access and Success, urged students to take a long-term view when considering their college education. If borrowing for college was part of their plan to begin with, she said, “it’s very worth thinking about staying with their plan.”
Quality four-year institutions are going to do their best, she said, to provide a good experience for students in the year ahead despite the pandemic.
It may be better to stay on track, Thompson said, than to delay starting college, especially since jobs and structured gap-year programs may be difficult to come by for students who defer admission. “What is there to do?” she said.
If a parent — or both — has lost a job, “that changes the decisionmaking process,” said Jayne Caflin Fonash, at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. With a tighter financial outlook, families may have to consider borrowing more money. “That’s a big decision to make,” Fonash said.
She urged students to obtain loan details from the financial aid office and to make sure they understood the cost of borrowing. Alternatively, some students may be considering attending a less expensive four-year college."
"May 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/jason-lewis-wins-gop-senate-endorsement/570895712/,StarTribune,Jason Lewis wins GOP Senate endorsement,"Republican Jason Lewis is officially his party’s pick to challenge DFL incumbent U.S. Sen. Tina Smith this November.
The former congressman and radio host won an endorsement vote by a landslide during a virtual Minnesota Republican Party convention held Saturday.
Lewis, who lost a suburban swing district in 2018, has been a vocal critic of top Democrats’ handling on issues ranging from the coronavirus pandemic to protests that turned violent in the wake of George Floyd’s death.
Saturday’s remote vote was the party’s second attempt at picking a candidate for the only statewide seat on the ballot in 2020. An earlier attempt to hold a virtual convention was canceled amid software problems.
In addition to endorsement votes and other party business, the annual convention usually gives candidates and party leaders an opportunity to rally supporters heading into the election season. But both the GOP and DFL had to scrap planned in-person affairs amid the coronavirus pandemic this year, moving to remote formats instead.
The DFL Party was also supposed to meet virtually this weekend but postponed its plans as unrest continued in the wake of Floyd’s death. Chair Ken Martin said delaying “was the only appropriate course of action given the grief and anger gripping much of our state and nation.”"

They were reverends and rabbis and people of the Islamic faith. They spoke in Somali, Spanish and English. And they pleaded, at times through tears, for their hurting communities to stay home Saturday night to prevent more pain.
Called together by Gov. Tim Walz, a group of Minnesota community leaders spent nearly two televised hours Saturday morning acknowledging the outrage over the death of George Floyd. In so doing, they also urged people to abide by an 8 p.m. curfew in place across a large swath of the Twin Cities to help put an end to the riots that have traumatized residents.
They decried the presence of rioters from outside the metro area who, under the cloak of darkness, used peaceful protesters as “human shields” to loot and torch drugstores, a post office, auto parts shops and gas stations, and to fire shots at law enforcement officers.
“White people from other communities are coming into my community, our communities as some kind of perverse poetry, as if it wasn’t bad enough already,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage.
“Go home now. The fascists on the plane right now, turn around.”
Clarence Castile knows how hard it is to ask people to stay home and not take to the streets. His nephew, Philando Castile, was shot seven times by an officer in Falcon Heights in 2016 after insisting during a traffic stop that he wasn’t reaching for a gun.
“Riots and protests are needed sometimes so that our state authorities, communities know what we’re trying to say,” Castile said Saturday. “Those victims who lose their lives because somebody doesn’t hear them, it has to be said by someone else in a different way, a stronger and more powerful way.”
Yet as Castile drove into work Friday, he saw a plume of black smoke from a burning building rising beyond the highway in south Minneapolis. And it terrified him.
“That’s something I’ve never seen and something I never want to see again,” he said. “We have to rebuild our community now.”
What started as peaceful protests early last week devolved Thursday and Friday into riots throughout the Twin Cities, bringing destruction to many neighborhoods.
At the news conference Saturday, Walz and state public safety leaders said they were overwhelmed by the number of people who broke the curfew Friday, spreading out across Minneapolis and St. Paul and causing more chaos than law enforcement could handle.
Many of those individuals were encouraged to come to the Twin Cities by national groups across the country, Walz said, capitalizing on the region’s discontent to fuel the anarchy.
“The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said.
Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Navigate MN, said she was devastated when she saw the wreckage on Minneapolis’s Lake Street, the “heart of the Latino community” and a hub for many immigrant-owned businesses that now are in ruins.
She said she was encouraged to later see people flood to the neighborhood to help clean up.
“Black, brown, Indigenous, Somali, Mexican, Salvadorans, taking care of the little legacies and the little businesses that are the lifelines in our communities,” she said. “But I also saw another story, folks nobody would recognize as our neighbors,” who came to “cause more harm and pain in places where there’s already harm and pain.”
For Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, watching Native American nonprofit MIGIZI in south Minneapolis burn down was particularly painful.
Before she was elected to office, Flanagan was a community organizer for more than two decades, marching in the streets after any fatal police encounter.
“My heart and guts are ripped out right now,” she said, because she can’t be on streets with her community, mourning at the scene where Floyd pleaded with police for his life.
“That space on 38th and Chicago is sacred ground, and people should be able to come together on that sacred ground and mourn and grieve and demand change and justice,” Flanagan said.
“In this moment, we cannot, because there are detractors. There are white supremacists. There are anarchists. There are people who are burning down the institutions that are core to our identity and who we are.”
Compounding the situation is the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1,000 Minnesotans, shuttered businesses and left people emotionally drained, said Mary Merrill of Sabathani Community Center.
“Here we are in a pandemic that we have been dealing with the last three, four months, then on top of that the old disease of racism and hatred reared its ugly head one more time,” she said.
Despite that, she pleaded with Minnesotans to stay home, a decision that would help law enforcement separate peaceful protesters from rioters and return the focus to Floyd’s memory and the effort to seek justice.
“We’re not going to let others come in and change the agenda we’ve been fighting now for 400 years,” she said."
"May 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/few-takers-expected-for-the-fed-s-new-600-billion-business-loan-program/570875852/,StarTribune,Few takers expected for the Fed's new $600 billion business loan program,"Billions of dollars in low-interest loans for companies hurt by the coronavirus are supposed to start flowing this week, but for the first time this year executives are not lining up to take advantage of a government-funded relief program.
Bankers and business groups report a surprising lack of interest in the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, which is supposed to pump $600 billion into small and medium-size companies that were in sound financial condition before the coronavirus-induced recession.
Though companies still need help, executives and small-business consultants said the rules of the Main Street program are so onerous that thousands of firms either won’t qualify or can’t afford to take on the risks that come with the short-term loans. Unlike the popular Payroll Protection Program (PPP), Main Street loans are not forgivable.
Some bankers and economists said the Main Street program seems designed to help large companies that don’t really need assistance.
“I’m upset that they’re calling this the Main Street Lending Program,” said Diane Paterson, associate director of the Small Business Development Center at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. “This is not going to save jobs on Main Street. This is a big business program.”
Even big companies have been slow to embrace the program. Though companies can qualify for assistance if they have fewer than 15,000 employees or $5 billion in annual revenue, just a handful of publicly held companies have disclosed their intent to apply for a Main Street loan, according to a Star Tribune review of recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
SeaWorld Entertainment, which shut down all 12 of its theme parks in March because of COVID-19 fears, said in an April report it is “actively engaged” in seeking a Main Street loan to help it deal with monthly operating losses of $25 million. Also expressing interest in the program are a national coffee roaster that has been hurt by a decline in restaurant sales and a Utah bedding firm that was hit with a 42% sales decline this spring.
So far, no public companies in Minnesota have announced an intent to apply for a Main Street loan. Polaris Inc., which suspended production at some of its plants this spring because of COVID-19, said it has not “looked extensively” at the Main Street program because it has other financial options.
Bankers, who were overwhelmed by the number of applications from companies seeking help through the PPP, said a replay is highly unlikely.
“We have been heavily reaching out to our customers to determine the level of interest, and I would dare say that the interest has been very little so far,” said Mitch Bleske, chief financial officer of Bremer Bank, which has processed about $1.5 billion in PPP loans.
There are two main problems with the Main Street program, according to executives and business consultants. First, companies must borrow at least $500,000, which is far more than most small businesses need to survive. Second, firms must repay the money within four years, which could stretch some budgets to the breaking point.
“If you have to borrow $500,000, you are probably eliminating most of the restaurant industry,” said Brian Marks, an economics professor at the University of New Haven in Connecticut who has studied the Main Street program. “The name of the program is a misnomer.”
Numbers don’t work
Tim Milner thought the Main Street program might help his industrial painting business in Farmington. Milner, president of JIT Powder Coating Co., hasn’t been shy about seeking government help. With business down 18%, Milner was eager to avoid laying off any of his 70 workers, so he applied for a disaster loan through the U.S. Small Business Administration. When that failed to come through, he obtained $550,000 through the PPP.
However, Milner now predicts it will take more than a year for his business to fully recover. To avoid reducing hours for his workers later this year, Milner said he probably needs another $300,000 in government help. He thought the Main Street program might be the answer.
Unfortunately, Milner said, the math doesn’t work. If his company borrowed the minimum of $500,000, it would owe another $12,000 a month once the payments came due in a year. Milner said his company, which generated about $7 million in sales last year, would need to boost business by 20% to cover the note.
“I said ‘No thanks,’ ” Milner said. “Even with a low interest rate, you aren’t going to take on this debt because you’d have to have an immediate spike in business to pay it off. And nobody is looking into their crystal ball and seeing that yet.”
Like other business owners in Minnesota, Milner hopes Congress creates one more round of PPP funding so that companies that have already utilized the program can go back for a second helping. “I think you’re going to see another big round of layoffs if the government doesn’t step in and extend the PPP program,” Milner said.
Another solution would be to make the Main Street loans forgivable, an option that was pushed by some business groups and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., one of the senators who persuaded the Federal Reserve to create its first direct-lending program since the Great Depression. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told Warner that the Fed isn’t empowered to convert loans into grants, according to a recent story in the Wall Street Journal.
The Fed declined to make an official available to address concerns about the program with the Star Tribune.
At a recent meeting of the Senate Banking Committee, Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took credit for reducing the minimum loan size from $1 million, as it was first proposed, to $500,000. They said the move was aimed at making sure there are no funding gaps in federal programs aimed at helping business owners through the crisis.
Still, Powell agreed the program may need further revisions.
“If the uptake is not where we would hope, then we are prepared to go after that and try to find ways to address the needs of this area of the economy,” Powell told the committee.
Program obstacle
Banking groups have suggested reducing the minimum loan size to as little as $50,000 and extending the length of the loan to six years.
“The four-year term is probably the biggest hurdle for this program,” said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis at the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group. “The Main Street Lending Program may be a great option for many businesses, but four years is not especially long when we don’t know what this looks like going forward.”
In a recent survey of NFIB members who had received either a PPP loan or had applied for a disaster loan through the U.S. Small Business Administration, 26% said they expect to need more government assistance in the next 12 months. Wade said more than half of the respondents don’t know yet.
Despite widespread criticism of the Main Street program, some companies are eager to get the process started. Their only complaint is how slow the Fed has been in launching the program, which was approved by Congress in March.
Bloomington attorney Dennis Monroe said he is working with two restaurant companies in the Midwest that have their paperwork ready. Both companies are seeking at least $5 million.
“This is a good program, from what I can tell,” said Monroe, former CEO of Parasole Restaurant Holdings, one of the premier restaurant companies in Minnesota. “It’s really aimed at sizable businesses. To make it work, you have to have profitability.”"
"June 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/as-trump-sinks-ever-lower-black-and-female-leaders-rise/570923772/,StarTribune,"As Trump sinks ever lower, black and female leaders rise","President Donald Trump’s inability to perform his job is a tragedy for the nation. But his wide-ranging incompetence - whether it’s his flailing in the face of police brutality and violent protests or his delusions as the coronavirus approached - is showing America that it has other leaders, many of whom are women or black (or black women), who can fill the void.
While Trump thrashes like a shark trapped in the sandy shallows of Twitter, these other leaders are rising. I was not expecting a rapper named “Killer Mike” to be the voice of reason in Trump’s inflamed America, but there he was last week, stepping in front of cameras at a news conference to denounce violence in Atlanta.
“I woke up wanting to see the world burn yesterday, because I’m tired of seeing black men die,” said Killer Mike, the son of an Atlanta police officer. “I am duty-bound to be here to simply say that it is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with an enemy.”
Instead, he said, “Now is the time to plot, plan, strategize, organize and mobilize.”
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms outshone the rap star at the press conference, alternately pleading for peace and demanding an end to chaos. “I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old. And when I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother would hurt,” Bottoms said. “So, you’re not going to out-concern me and out-care about where we are in America.”
Bottoms also praised the city’s white female police chief, Erika Shields, who had had her own viral moment last week when she waded into a crowd and was filmed patiently listening to, and reassuring, a distraught black mother.
ABC’s Jake Tapper asked Bottoms Sunday about Trump’s unique qualities. Her response bears repeating:
“This is like Charlottesville all over again. He speaks and he makes it worse. There are times when you should just be quiet. And I wish that he would just be quiet. Or, if he can’t be silent, if there is somebody of good sense and good conscience in the White House, put him in front of a teleprompter and pray that he reads it and at least says the right things.”
Bottoms’ emphasis on “says” was political realism. Perhaps someone could script some words for Trump and, provided he didn’t deviate and say what he really thinks, Trump could pretend to lead.
A few weeks back, while Trump was botching the response to the pandemic, LeBron James and Barack Obama did what mature grown-ups do: They tried to make the kids feel better. The two black American icons starred in a televised commencement program for high school seniors whose ritual had been stolen by the virus.
It’s the sort of thing Trump would never be able to pull off. In the long run, however, the current president may do as much or more than the previous one to encourage women, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and others on the path to leadership.
The 2018 midterm election was a fierce reaction against Trump featuring highly competent and racially diverse female candidates. Likewise, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whose management of the pandemic contrasts well with Trump’s, has been elevated by Trump’s attacks on her. Val Demings, a black, female, former police chief who now serves in Congress, is poised to gain a national spotlight in part due to Trump’s incapacity.
It wasn’t supposed to be this way. MAGA is premised on stopping the erosion of white male power and cementing in place its economic, social and political preeminence. It appears that, along with so much else, Trump is poised to destroy that ugly dream as well."
"June 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-reports-10-covid-19-deaths-lowest-in-two-weeks/570923192/,StarTribune,"Minnesota COVID-19 cases, deaths rise amid protests, reopenings","One national analyst moved Minnesota into the “making progress” category in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic this weekend, though the state reported another 10 deaths and 361 lab-confirmed cases of the infectious disease on Monday.
The death count was the lowest in two weeks, and the daily case count was the lowest in the state since late April, but whether they reflect a trend is unclear.
The state has reported 1,050 deaths and 25,208 known illnesses associated with COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by exposure to a novel coronavirus. The number of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals stood at 549 on Monday — with 253 of those patients needing intensive care.
Throughout the course of the pandemic, case numbers reported on Monday have tended to be lower than those reported on other days of the week. The state also shut down its public health lab amid the protests, so COVID-19 test results were reported this weekend only from private labs.
Reported progress in Minnesota also preceded a week of protests and riots in Minneapolis and St. Paul following the death of George Floyd while in police custody. Whether so much face-to-face interaction results in a new wave of virus transmission and COVID-19 cases is unclear and won’t be known for a week or two because of the delayed onset of symptoms following infection.
Greatest risks of severe COVID-19 remained with the elderly and people with underlying health conditions, including diabetes, asthma and diseases of the heart, lungs, kidneys and the immune system. Among all deaths, 855 involved residents of long-term care facilities.
As many as 80% of infections with the novel coronavirus result in mild or no symptoms, which adds to concerns that protesters could be carrying the virus and spreading it to others without knowing it.
Young people haven’t suffered as many severe cases — as people 30 and younger represent 47% of the lab-confirmed cases in Minnesota but only six total deaths.
Transmission of the virus among predominantly younger protesters could have a broader impact, though. Rates of severe cases have been higher among black people in Minnesota, who make up more than 20% of the state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations but only 6% of the state population.
Health officials in late May noted how an outbreak among a largely black Cedar-Riverside community of Minneapolis could be traced in part to the number of people carrying the virus back from the long-term care facilities in which they worked.
Any sign of the pandemic easing is nonetheless good news. State health officials had been closely watching case counts following the end of a 51-day stay-at-home order on May 18, because of concerns that increased business and retail activity could increase disease transmission.
Additional restrictions were eased Monday, with restaurants and bars being able to provide outdoor service, and salons being able to offer limited appointments with mask wearing required.
The national Covid Exit Strategy website had recently upgraded Minnesota from “doing poorly” to “making progress” against COVID-19 based on its average daily case count declining over the past two weeks."
"June 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/state-recommends-covid-19-tests-for-minnesota-protesters/570932552/,StarTribune,State recommends COVID-19 tests for Minnesota protesters,"State health officials will be encouraging people protesting the death of George Floyd to seek COVID-19 testing — regardless of whether they feel sick — due to the increased risk of the disease spreading at mass gatherings.
A surge in COVID-19 cases among protesters isn’t a given — many are wearing masks, and protests are outside, which can diffuse the virus. But health officials on Monday said they are expecting that the gatherings will counteract some progress.
“Concentrated gatherings and loud talking, singing, yelling, you know, all of those loud vocal expressions, exacerbate the risk of spread,” said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner, though it is “mitigated ... by the fact that this is outdoors.”
Minnesota reported 361 COVID-19 lab-confirmed cases on Monday, which was the first day since April 28 when the daily count was below 400. The number was likely deflated by the lower reporting that has happened on most Mondays in this pandemic, and by the closure over the weekend of the state’s public health lab, which didn’t contribute results on Monday.
And yet this also coincided with the Covid Exit Strategy website changing Minnesota’s status in the pandemic from “trending poorly” to “making progress” — based largely on the reduction in the growth in cases over the past two weeks. Ten deaths reported on Monday brought the state’s total to 1,050 but also was the lowest single-day count in two weeks.
The threat of a new wave of cases among protesters prompted state health officials to recommend COVID-19 testing for all of them. One reason for concern is that 80% of infected people suffer mild or no symptoms, meaning protesters could spread the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 without knowing they have it.
The Minnesota Department of Health will soon issue guidance about asymptomatic testing of protesters, because until now it had asked doctors to prioritize testing supplies for patients with symptoms.
A key recommendation will be when asymptomatic protesters should seek testing, because the incubation period of the virus following infection is around five days — with a range of two to 14 days. Testing too soon could miss developing infections, Malcolm said.
Masks have been common, but not universal, at demonstrations, as some protesters wore them for protection while others used them to conceal their identities.
“Obviously, it’s something to be nervous about and thoughtful of,” said Jessica Tomann of St. Louis Park, who wore a mask at a memorial on Monday for Floyd. “It’s also like there’s two viruses fighting this nation right now, and it’s like, ‘What’s more important?’ It’s a double-edged sword, but you’ve got to pick the justice you really are going to fight for, you know?”
Maria Smith drove with her daughter to E. 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue on Monday so that her daughter, a jingle dancer, could perform with others. COVID-19 is a risk, but the memorial “is taking a little more precedence than that,” said Smith, who wore a mask while standing shoulder to shoulder with other women at the event.
Stocking clinics
Social distancing and a 51-day statewide stay-home order, which ended May 18, had been credited with slowing the growth of COVID-19 in Minnesota, which is one reason health officials believed the pandemic was still peaking here compared with other states.
Modeling by University of Minnesota and state health researchers showed that adherence to the order had reduced disease transmission by 55%, though initially they had predicted a reduction of 80%. But no modeling accounted for the death of George Floyd during an arrest by Minneapolis police officers — and the outrage that sent people crowding into the streets.
Upon learning of the likely protests, the state Department of Health made sure masks were available through community clinics and partners if protesters wanted them, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.
Studies have shown that cloth, nonmedical-grade masks reduce the chance that wearers spread the coronavirus to others. These masks don’t protect the wearers from being infected by others, though, unlike fitted N95 masks that are being largely held in reserve for hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.
State health authorities will make sure that clinics are well-stocked with collection kits for COVID-19 tests of asymptomatic protesters, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist.
Protesters can help by monitoring their own health and calling their doctors right away if they experience dry cough, difficulty breathing, fever, loss of taste or other classic COVID-19 symptoms, she added.
When it comes to the infection risk at a protest, “being outdoors is better than being in a very closed, confined indoor-type of setting,” Lynfield said. “However it is hard to maintain a 6-foot distance at a rally.”
Toll on black community
The potential spread of cases among protesters could be a double whammy, even though many of them are in the younger age demographic that has seen far fewer severe COVID-19 cases. Minnesotans 30 and under make up 74% of known infections but only six total deaths.
Further, many of the protesters are black, and people in this racial demographic suffer higher rates of chronic disease, which raises the likelihood of severe or even fatal COVID-19 cases. An initial state analysis showed that 23% of COVID-19 hospitalizations involved black people, even though they make up 6% of Minnesota’s population.
Another problem is that black people make up a substantial share of the workforce in long-term care facilities — and residents of these facilities have suffered 855 of the COVID-19 deaths so far.
An outbreak late last month of COVID-19 in Minneapolis’ largely black Cedar-Riverside neighborhood showed how infection risks work together. Health officials believe the outbreak was sparked by long-term care workers bringing the virus from work to friends and relatives in that community.
Assessing the impact of the protests on the pandemic in Minnesota will be challenging, because it is coming at the same time as other changes in state policies and restrictions. That includes the allowance as of Monday for restaurants and bars to resume outdoor dining service, and for salons to offer limited appointments at 25% of their usual capacities.
Contact tracing by state health investigators will be challenging as well when identifying sources of COVID-19 infection for people who participated in mass protests.
Finding the sources of infections for sick individuals is only one purpose of contact tracing, though, Ehresmann said. The other is to identify their close contacts around the time they developed symptoms, so that those contacts can quarantine themselves and avoid spreading the virus further."
"June 1, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-and-national-monthly-manufacturing-indexes-improve-but-still-at-recessionary-levels/570927792/,StarTribune,Minnesota and national monthly manufacturing indexes improve but still at recessionary levels,"Monthly manufacturing reports for Minnesota, the Midwest and the nation are still in recessionary territory for May, but surveyed factory managers also expressed optimism that it will continue on an upward swing.
In Minnesota, the index increased from 34.8 in April to 39.8 in May. An index of 50 is neutral. New orders, though, were on the low side, according to Creighton University's survey of Mid-America manufacturers.
The overall nine-state index improved to 43.5 from 35.1 in April.
The survey's confidence index improved, though, to suggest that businesses are optimistic the economy will begin to rebound within the next six months. That index improved to 56.6 in May from April's weak 45.5 reading.
Creighton economist Ernie Goss said the survey shows the coronavirus outbreak has had a greater impact on businesses tied directly to the consumer and a smaller impact on manufacturers.
""This is a consumer-led recession with manufacturing lagging. Nonetheless, Creighton's survey indicates that the regional manufacturing sector is trapped in a recession,"" said Goss, who oversees the survey.
Manufacturers were stung by a deep demand downturn after COVID-19 struck the U.S. The slump was exacerbated by stay-home orders that shut some of them down, plus higher costs in both shipping and keeping their employees safe from the coronavirus.
Goss added that the federal stimulus plan, Federal Reserve incentive programs and the U.S. stocks rebound all boosted confidence.
Goss said that before the coronavirus outbreak took hold in mid-March there were only 160,170 workers in the region receiving unemployment benefits. By early May, that number soared to more than 1.3 million workers.
Besides Minnesota, the Creighton survey covers the Dakotas, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma.
U.S. manufacturing activity eased off an 11-year low in May, though the recovery from the pandemic could take years because of high joblessness.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday that its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 43.1 in May, from 41.5 in April, which was the lowest level since April 2009.
The survey's inflation index increased to 48.6 in May from April's 44, but still indicated wholesale prices are declining.
The first increase in the ISM index since January mirrored improvements in regional manufacturing surveys in May and suggested April was the nadir for economic activity. At least 21.4 million jobs were lost been March and April.
However, Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska of Jefferies said in a research note that the movement in the manufacturing economy was in the right direction but ""hardly anything to get excited about.
""Because of its construction [it's a diffusion index that measures breadth, not magnitude of economic shifts], the ISM index will probably improve materially in June as factories begin to reopen and as Boeing resumes production of the 737 MAX after a prolonged layoff,"" Simons and Markowska said. ""However, a return to pre-COVID levels of manufacturing output will take much longer, and will be measured in quarters, not months.""
The economy contracted at a 5% annualized rate in the first quarter. Gross domestic product is expected to decline at a rate as sharp as 40% in the second quarter, which would the biggest contraction in output since the Great Depression on the 1930s.
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 31.8 in May from 27.1 in April, which was the lowest since December 2008."
"June 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-protests-challenge-contact-tracing-of-covid-19/570965922/,StarTribune,Minnesota protests challenge contact tracing of COVID-19,"Minnesota has gone all-in on contact tracing — mobilizing more than 400 interviewers and investigators to find people at risk for COVID-19 and prevent them from spreading the infectious disease.
But a new report questions that strategy against the coronavirus causing this pandemic. And those concerns were raised irrespective of the mass protests over the death of George Floyd, which could produce a new wave of COVID-19 cases that would be tough to trace.
“We’ve almost seen a mind-set that if a little contact tracing is good, a lot more must be better. … We’re saying, ‘No that’s not true,’ ” Michael Osterholm, executive director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), said on Tuesday.
CIDRAP’s report stated that contact tracing is valuable against viruses that infect a small percentage of a community, and cause clear symptoms, but that COVID-19 is widespread and involves a coronavirus that many people carry without symptoms.
The report recommends continued study to see if contact tracing works in the U.S. rather than assuming that it will work as well as it did in Asian countries with strict government testing mandates and quarantines.
Testing boosts tracing
The Minnesota Department of Health on Tuesday reported 25,508 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,072 deaths, but health officials suspect that as much as 5% of the state’s population has been infected. That would be 280,000 people.
Contact tracing usually occurs after people have been diagnosed through testing, and identifies anyone they have been close to who might have been infected. Those at-risk contacts are then asked to quarantine themselves until their infection status is clear.
The CIDRAP report raises valid concerns, though state infectious disease director Kris Ehresmann said that contact tracing isn’t expected to identify all cases and stop the virus’ spread completely.
“We can’t say that case investigations or contact tracing can eliminate transmission,” she said. “We’re really trying to mitigate as best we can.”
Contact tracing helped contain a measles outbreak in 2017 that was centered around Somali-Americans and child-care facilities. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic this winter, Minnesota officials viewed it as part of a containment strategy to keep the virus from spreading out of control, and discussed how it could reach a point at which it would no longer be effective.
As the search for treatments and a vaccine continues, though, Ehresmann said contact tracing remains useful.
“It’s the tool that is available,” she said.
It could be working, too.
An increase in diagnostic testing over the past month has allowed for more contact tracing, and in the past week the growth in COVID-19 cases in Minnesota has ebbed. The 310 lab-confirmed cases on Tuesday was the lowest daily case count in the COVID-19 pandemic since April 27.
Hospitalization numbers have plateaued for now as well — at 537 COVID-19 patients admitted and 248 needing intensive care statewide. Those numbers had been rising so fast two weeks ago that hospitals in the Twin Cities were nearing capacity and diverting patients.
Ehresmann said her staff is keeping up with the goals of reaching out to people within 24 hours of positive tests, and having tracers conduct at least eight interviews per day. There is no way to know if that is reducing the number of COVID-19 cases, though.
As of May 24, 36% of people infected with COVID-19 in their communities had no known sources of exposure — preventing health officials from identifying others at risk.
Getting people to pick up their phones is one limitation, though Ehresmann said most comply with quarantine requests once they are determined to be at risk.
Adequate information is another limiting factor. About 10,000 free tests at National Guard armories over the Memorial Day weekend found 405 COVID-19 cases.
To keep up with higher-than-expected demand, the testers accepted forms from people without complete contact information. That has hindered contact tracing.
Reaching vulnerable groups
Ehresmann said it is premature to assume Minnesota has peaked in its COVID-19 cases — given the potential of the protests to spread the virus.
At a rally Monday night at the spot where Floyd died last week, about a third of the 1,000 attendees weren’t wearing masks.
The state on Tuesday advised doctors to test protesters, first responders and volunteers who cleaned up after the riots — regardless of whether they had symptoms of infection.
Ehresmann said the state is looking to improve contact tracing in vulnerable populations, including in minority and immigrant communities that have been hesitant to participate. The state has offered a $1.5 million contract to firms that can increase minority participation in COVID-19 testing and contact tracing this year.
Minorities have suffered higher rates of severe COVID-19, in part because they have more chronic health problems that complicate their infections. Black people make up less than 7% of the state’s population but more than 20% of its COVID-19 hospitalizations.
One concern with the focus on contact tracing is the distraction from other public health problems that haven’t gone away amid the pandemic.
Minnesota’s contact tracing team includes workers from other state health divisions who were reassigned, as well as volunteers and workers provided by health insurers — Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota and Medica.
Retasking foodborne disease investigators was easier with restaurants shut down, but they are starting to reopen, Ehresmann said.
Osterholm said that is a key problem if states commit too many people to contact tracing for COVID-19, without proof that it helps, and then neglect proven services.
The rate of childhood immunizations has dipped, for example, Osterholm said.
“I know that’s a very bad thing,” he said.
The state is seeking to outsource the case investigation and contact tracing work, in part to allow health workers to return to such tasks. It is seeking bids from firms that can manage up to 1,400 workers.
The state also hired Rose International, a St. Louis-based staffing firm, to hire about 40 contact investigators with specialized skills, including medical backgrounds and proficiency in foreign languages. The contract, which can pay out up to $3 million, runs until July 1."
"June 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-lawmakers-and-advocates-call-for-end-to-virus-pipeline-to-elder-care/570968262/,StarTribune,Minnesota lawmakers and advocates call for end to 'virus pipeline' to elder care,"Minnesota state health officials are facing mounting public pressure to change or discontinue a policy that allows hospitals to discharge coronavirus patients to nursing homes already devastated by the virus.
Since the pandemic began, the Minnesota Department of Health has turned to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to relieve the burden on hospital systems that were at risk of being overwhelmed by patients sickened with COVID-19, the deadly respiratory sickness caused by the virus. Minnesota hospitals have discharged more than 260 people with COVID-19 to long-term facilities, including communities that have struggled with large and deadly COVID-19 outbreaks.
At a Senate committee hearing Tuesday, state Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm defended the practice of allowing COVID-19 patients to be discharged to senior homes, asserting that the alternative — keeping people in hospitals longer — would potentially expose them to more infections.
“Staying in hospitals beyond the point where you need to be there is itself a risky thing,” Malcolm said. “We do believe that a skilled nursing facility is the right level of care for a lot of people leaving acute [hospital] care.”
Yet public health experts and senior advocacy groups have warned that transfers of COVID-19 patients to nursing homes could endanger vulnerable seniors, particularly in facilities that are chronically short of staff and have poor health and safety records. As it stands, even nursing homes with poor infection-control standards, as well as large and deadly clusters of the virus have been allowed to accept infected patients from hospitals.
One nursing home, North Ridge Health and Rehab in New Hope, has accepted more than 40 patients from hospitals and other long-term care facilities, even though the facility has been ravaged by the virus and cited for dozens of health and safety violations over the past few years.
A number of groups, including AARP Minnesota and a state association of geriatricians, are calling for more transparency and a careful vetting of facilities that receive COVID-19 patients, to ensure they meet minimum staffing and care standards.
“The public has a right to be assured that, if these facilities are taking on this increased risk, then the proper health and safety protocols are in place,” said Mary Jo George, associate state director of advocacy at AARP Minnesota.
So far, 11 facilities statewide have been designated as “COVID support sites,” with designated units or wings to handle coronavirus patients. Those facilities have gone through a rigorous vetting process to ensure they have adequate staffing, supplies and infection-control standards, state officials said. However, the Health Department has declined to reveal which facilities have been vetted as COVID support sites.
Sen. Karin Housley, R-St. Mary’s Point, chairwoman of the Senate Family Care and Aging Committee, has been pushing for the creation of entire facilities for COVID-19 patients as a way to ease crowding in nursing homes and contain the virus’ spread.
“Patients with COVID-19 should be kept in separate buildings with separate staff and separate ventilation systems,” she said. “It’s a really bad idea to bring them into facilities that have been working hard to stay COVID-free.
“We need to end the virus pipeline from hospitals to long-term care facilities,” Housley added.
The practice has begun to generate public outrage. In April, the operator of an Apple Valley nursing home, Augustana Care Health and Rehabilitation, pulled the plug on plans to open a special unit for coronavirus patients after dozens of residents’ families voiced concerns.
On a rainy evening last week, about a dozen families of nursing home residents, including some who have lost loved ones to the virus, held a vigil in front of the governor’s residence protesting the discharge of COVID-19 patients to nursing homes. They lit more than 700 candles to memorialize residents who have died in Minnesota’s long-term care settings and clutched signs saying, “No Transfers!”
“It’s a terrible, terrible policy and it has to stop,” Vicki Sheaffer of Mahtomedi, who helped organize the vigil, said of the transfers. “We as a society need to be more cognizant about protecting our elders, and putting coronavirus patients in these facilities is basically a death sentence.”
The practice of allowing nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients has been controversial in other states, too. In New York, for instance, Gov. Andrew Cuomo in March mandated nursing homes to admit new or returning patients regardless of their COVID-19 status, citing an urgent need to expand capacity in hospitals. But Cuomo reversed course last month and dropped the mandate after providers complained and a large outbreak occurred in a large nursing home required to take patients as a result of the policy.
The virus has hit residents of long-term care facilities particularly hard, both in Minnesota and nationally. At least 26,000 nursing home residents have died of COVID-19, according to preliminary data released Monday by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The numbers also show a grim toll among nursing home staff, with nearly 450 dying of the virus. In Minnesota, at least 15 nursing home staff have died, the federal data shows.
However, the true death toll is likely much higher, because only about 80% of nursing homes nationally have reported death numbers so far. The national data also does not include assisted-living facilities, which are not regulated by the federal government. In Minnesota, assisted-living facilities are home to nearly twice as many residents as more tightly regulated nursing homes.
The dense layout of many larger senior communities has contributed to the virus’ rapid spread, despite efforts to isolate infected patients on separate wings or floors. So far, nearly 3,000 residents of long-term care facilities across Minnesota have contracted the illness and 866 have died. Taken together, these facilities account for 81% of the state deaths from the virus. About 400 facilities still have active cases, state officials said Tuesday.
“Why on Earth would they now think that long-term care facilities can handle COVID-19 patients when in Minnesota 81% of the deaths are happening in these facilities?” asked Jean Peters, a nurse and president of Elder Voice Family Advocates, a grassroots advocacy group for seniors. “It is time to stop marginalizing the care of elders and vulnerable adults.”"
"June 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/covid-19-just-stop-the-superspreading/570986552/,StarTribune,COVID-19: Just stop the superspreading,"HONG KONG – You must have heard about some of these outbreaks; they’re almost emblematic of the COVID-19 pandemic by now: that megachurch in South Korea, meatpacking plants in the United States, a wedding in Jordan, funerals around the world.
You’ve also probably heard of SARS-CoV-2’s R0 (R-naught), or basic reproductive number, the average number of people to whom an infected person passes on a new virus when no measures to contain it have been taken. This coronavirus’s R0 is thought to range between 2 and 3; an epidemic is curbed when that figure drops below 1, the replacement rate.
But that figure has limitations: It doesn’t convey the vast range between how much some infected people transmit the virus and how little others do.
This is why epidemiologists also look at a virus’s dispersion factor, known as “k,” which captures that range and so, too, the potential for superspreading events. To simplify: The fewer the number of cases of infection responsible for all transmissions, the lower k generally is (though other factors, like the R0, also are relevant).
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, evidence is growing that superspreading is a hugely significant factor of total transmission.
Take Hong Kong, which as of June 2 had 1,088 confirmed or probable cases (and four deaths), for a population of about 7.5 million. The city has managed to largely suppress local outbreaks of COVID-19 without a lockdown or mandatory blanket stay-at-home orders, favoring instead a strategy of testing people suspected of being infected, tracing and quarantining their contacts and isolating confirmed cases in the hospital — coupled with outright bans or other restrictions on large social gatherings.
After these measures were progressively relaxed in recent weeks, a new outbreak of seven cases, possibly a superspreading event, has been reported over the past few days: Three are employees of a food-packing company; the other four live in the same housing estate as one of the employees.
We recently published a preprint (a preliminary paper, still to be peer-reviewed) about 1,038 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong between Jan. 23 and April 28 that, using contact-tracing data, identified all local clusters of infection.
We found that superspreading has overwhelmingly contributed to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the city overall.
Of the 349 local cases we identified — the remaining 689 cases were imported from other territories — 196 were linked to just six superspreading events. One person alone appears to have infected 73 individuals after frequenting several bars in late March. Weddings, temples, hot-pot dinners, work parties and karaoke venues featured in the other clusters.
In our study, just 20% of cases, all of them involving social gatherings, accounted for an astonishing 80% of transmissions. (That, along with other things, suggests that the dispersion factor, k, of SARS-CoV-2 is about 0.45).
Another 10% of cases accounted for the remaining 20% of transmissions — with each of these infected people on average spreading the virus to only one other person, maybe two people. This mostly occurred within households.
No less astonishing was this corollary finding: Seventy percent of the people infected did not pass on the virus to anyone.
Now you might be wondering if our study, or the experience of Hong Kong, with its small number of total infections, is more broadly representative. We think so.
An analysis of early cases in the city of Wuhan, China, the site of the original outbreak, published by researchers in Switzerland in late January, was inconclusive about the frequency of superspreading. But more and more studies support the conclusion that in places other than Hong Kong, too, superspreading is a major driver of overall transmission.
A study published in The Lancet in late April, based on data from Shenzhen, southern China, about suspected cases among travelers from around Wuhan, concluded that 80% of transmissions were caused by 8-9% of cases.
Another (also peer-reviewed) paper from late April found that 94 out of 216 employees on the 11th floor of a crowded call center in South Korea likely were infected by a single index case in late February and early March.
A recent preprint (not yet peer-reviewed) about 212 COVID-19 cases in Israel between late February and late April traced 80% of the transmissions back to just 1-10% of cases.
According to mathematical modeling by Akira Endo, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and others, about 10% of SARS-CoV-2 cases might account for 80% of transmissions worldwide (and the virus might have a dispersion factor, k, of about 0.1).
With other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS as well, a small group of superspreaders was responsible for a large majority of all transmissions.
During the SARS outbreak of 2002-03, hospitals, airplanes and densely populated housing complexes were all implicated in large superspreading events.
A 2005 study of SARS cases in Singapore — considered seminal in the field — found that just 6% of cases accounted for 80% of all transmissions, while 73% of infected people appeared not to have spread the infection. The k factor seemed to be about 0.16.
In Hong Kong, one patient is thought to have infected 138 people in a single hospital during two to three weeks in March 2003; a cluster of 331 infections was traced back to a single resident in the Amoy Gardens housing complex.
For MERS, which first surfaced in Saudi Arabia in 2012, about 14% of cases are thought to have accounted for 80% of transmissions, with k=0.26, and most MERS superspreading events have been linked to hospitals.
This data in turn raise this crucial question: Why are some cases superspreaders and others not?
Superspreading is a complex phenomenon, and it depends on several factors: an infected person’s degree of infectiousness, the length of other people’s exposure to them, the setting of that exposure.
We are not aware of any study having been published that identifies individual characteristics that might account for an infected person’s degree of infectiousness or could otherwise help predict who may be a superspreader.
This much, though, is known: The infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 appears to peak within the first few days of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and then decrease with time. That said, one can be contagious before displaying symptoms or without ever displaying any symptoms. (Hence the importance of face masks.)
It stands to reason, too, that a highly contagious person is more likely to spread the infection in a crowd (at a wedding, in a bar, during a sporting event) than in a small group (within their household), and when contact is extensive or repeated.
Transmission is more likely during gatherings indoors than outdoors. Simply ventilating a room can help. We believe that with the South Korean call-center cluster, the essential factor of transmission was the extent of time spent in a crowded office area.
Also consider this counterexample: Japan. The government recently lifted a state of emergency after controlling its epidemic without having put in place any stringent social distancing measures or even doing much testing. Instead, it relied on largely voluntary measures encouraging people to stay at home and advice to avoid overcrowding in public venues.
In essence, Japan adopted an anti-superspreading strategy. The approach was targeted at limiting what some researchers from Tohoku University have called the “three Cs”: closed spaces, crowds and close contacts.
We believe that despite Japan’s success so far, Hong Kong’s suppression strategy, which includes testing and contact-tracing as well, is preferable in the long run, if only because it’s better preparation for any future outbreaks.
But the record in both places, and elsewhere, points to the same conclusion: It’s not just that superspreading events are happening with SARS-CoV-2; they appear to be driving much of the pandemic.
This fact is alarming and reassuring at the same time.
It’s alarming because it suggests a virus swift and efficient, and so seemingly unstoppable.
But the considerable role of superspreading in this pandemic should be reassuring, too, because it also suggests a way to stop SARS-CoV-2 that is both less onerous and more effective than many of the strategies that have been pursued so far.
The epidemic’s growth can be controlled effectively with tactics far less disruptive, socially and economically, than the extended lockdowns or other extreme forms of social distancing that much of the world has experienced over the past few months.
Forget about maintaining — or, if infections resurge, resuming — sweeping measures designed to stem the virus’s spread in all forms. Just focus on stopping the superspreading."
"June 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/battle-plan-2-0-needed-to-protect-minnesota-seniors-from-covid-19/570998122/,StarTribune,Battle plan 2.0 needed to protect Minnesota seniors from COVID-19,"The answer from Charlene Harrington, an expert on medical care in nursing homes, is unequivocal. Asked if federal and state health officials should end the practice of discharging hospitalized COVID-19 patients into nursing homes without separate specialized care facilities, the University of California-San Francisco emeritus nursing professor offers an unhesitating ""yes.""
Once the virus gets into a long-term care center, it can ""spread like wildfire,"" Harrington told an editorial writer recently. Given residents' vulnerabilities and the facilities' long-standing challenges of staffing and infection control, it's best to err on the side of caution even though it appears the virus has entered these centers through infected staff and contractors.
Harrington is a respected researcher. Recommendations from others who have the same deep expertise are needed as federal and state officials combat an epidemic that has disproportionately claimed the lives of long-term care (LTC) residents. Minnesota recently rolled out a five-point ""battle plan"" to thwart this, but improvements such as the one Harrington recommended are clearly needed.
Since this new strain of coronavirus arrived in the U.S., it has been unrelenting in taking the lives of those living in congregate care settings. Over 80% of Minnesota's COVID-19 fatalities have been LTC residents. That high percentage has eclipsed what most states have reported, suggesting the virus is exacting a larger toll in LTC facilities here than elsewhere.
But new data from the Trump administration indicates that Minnesota may not be a tragic outlier nationally. Instead, it appears state health officials have cast a broader net to find LTC deaths, a finding that should inform and elevate the debate as legislators look for ways to protect seniors. The new information comes from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In April, the agency required nursing homes to report COVID-19 cases and deaths directly to federal health officials. The data gathered is useful for disease surveillance and provides the first real chance to do an ""apples to apples"" comparison of COVID-19's impact on nursing homes.
Until now, states have had wide latitude in choosing how or even if they report this information. For example, if an LTC resident became infected but died in a hospital while receiving care, that death may not have been included as an LTC death. Or, states may not have reported deaths only from nursing homes instead of all elder care facilities such as assisted living.
In Minnesota, there have been 12.7 deaths from the virus per 1,000 nursing home residents. The national average: 27.5 deaths per 1,000. The real outliers are New Jersey, with 145.5 deaths per 1,000 and Connecticut with 125.
Regionally, the comparison is less favorable for Minnesota, with Wisconsin and Iowa reporting lower death rates (4.7 and 8.8, respectively). At the same time, a far lower percentage of nursing homes in these two border states were surveyed, suggesting that the data may still not be comprehensive. Regardless, Minnesota clearly still has much work to do to reduce the death toll among its seniors. A Tuesday hearing led by state Sen. Karin Housley, R-St. Mary's Point, put a commendable spotlight on this issue.
Housley plans to hold future hearings on this. These would be more productive if she invited medical experts such as Harrington to testify. Changing the hospital discharge policy should be explored, but it's an err-on-the-side-of-caution policy, not a silver bullet. Right now, there's no evidence of outbreaks caused by COVID-19 patients discharged into LTC facilities. What else can be done to close off the main avenue by which the virus enters care centers, via infected staff and contractors?
Another topic that needs scrutiny: What is working in other states? If Wisconsin and Iowa's new metrics are better than Minnesota's, what is it that they're doing to achieve this?
Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm has a long record of trouble­shooting complex policy issues. Her recent work on elder care regulatory reforms brought together elder care advocates, the long-term care industry and legislators. Consensus was achieved and solutions implemented.
The same process needs to unfold even faster to safeguard Minnesota's LTC residents from COVID-19. Minnesota's leaders are up to the challenge. They need to focus, drill down and above all, collaborate."
"June 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/anti-malaria-drug-in-u-of-m-trial-does-little-to-stop-covid-19/570989342/,StarTribune,Hydroxychloroquine drug in University of Minnesota trial does little to prevent COVID-19,"An anti-malaria drug that has been trumpeted as a therapy for COVID-19 was unable in a University of Minnesota clinical trial to prevent the onset of the infectious disease.
The results of the nation’s first randomized trial with the drug, hydroxychloroquine, against COVID-19 will disappoint doctors who had hoped for new therapies amid the pandemic. Many prescribers had given it off-label to COVID-19 patients — in the absence of other options — and President Donald Trump had been an early champion of the drug and said in mid-May that he was taking it for the preventive benefit, a benefit that the U study could not verify.
“While we are disappointed that this did not prevent COVID-19, we are pleased that we were able to provide a conclusive answer,” said Dr. David Boulware, leader of the U trial. “Our objective was to find an answer.”
Results published online Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine showed little difference in the onset of COVID-19 in 414 people who took hydroxychloroquine and a comparison group of 407 that took only folic acid vitamins. All participants had at least moderate risk for COVID-19 after being exposed to others in their homes or workplaces who had the illness.
There was a small difference, as 11.8% of people taking the drug developed COVID-19, compared with 14.3% of those taking vitamins, the study showed. However, that difference was considered statistically insignificant.
Even if valid, the small difference means that 42 people would have to take the drug prophylactically to prevent one COVID-19 case. That would be costly and expose people to drug side effects. The study showed that 40% experienced mild side effects such as nausea, but it allayed fears that widespread use of the drug could result in cardiac and other complications.
The study provides evidence only of whether the drug is effective in preventing COVID-19 onset following exposure to someone with the infection.
A separate U trial is examining whether it benefits patients after early onset of symptoms, but results haven’t been published.
Enthusiasm for the drug has already cooled after open-label trials and case reports that found little benefit, but the U results are a significant advance.
Minnesota as of Wednesday reported 25,870 lab-confirmed cases and 1,086 deaths from COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus for which there is no vaccine.
While COVID-19 case numbers have ebbed, state health officials suspect another wave after protests over the death of George Floyd brought thousands of people together.
Chanting and shouting could hasten the spread of the virus, said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner, along with police use of tear gas to break up protests that could cause infected people to breathe heavily.
“COVID-19 can spread easily and quickly in large groups of people who are close together for long periods of time,” she said.
The state is advising protesters, first responders and community volunteers to seek diagnostic testing for COVID-19, ideally from their own doctors, five to seven days after participation in mass events.
Anxiety about COVID-19 was reflected last week in a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which showed a twentyfold surge in prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, in late March after the World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 pandemic and the president tweeted March 19 in favor of the drug.
Surges based on hype threaten the supply of the drug for approved treatments of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, said Dr. Frank Rhame, a virologist at Allina Health, which is why the U study results are so important.
“It’s a great illustration of the importance of getting a well-designed study to get at the medical reality of the situation,” Rhame said. “You have to be open to all possibilities until you have the data.”
The U trial was the first in the world to assess whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent the onset of COVID-19 in people exposed to the novel coronavirus that causes it, and the first placebo-controlled double-blind study of the drug’s effect on COVID-19. Blinding means that patients didn’t know whether they took vitamins or drugs, and researchers didn’t know either.
While not a primary goal, the study also found no increased protection for participants who also took zinc or vitamin C. A separate study suggested that zinc could boost the effectiveness of chloroquine, but even if that’s true, the U authors noted that most Americans consume enough zinc already so supplements shouldn’t be needed.
Jen Reiner of Edina figures she took the real hydroxychloroquine during the study, based on the continuous nausea she felt. She didn’t get COVID-19 despite being in close contact with her infected husband, but then neither did her children and they weren’t in the study.
“A bit bummed the drug didn’t seem to work,” Reiner said, “but it had to be one way or the other.”
Boulware said the results were validated and held up to extensive peer review but may face challenges and criticisms from skeptics hoping for better results. The researchers acknowledged limitations of the study, which recruited participants in North America online and mailed medication to them. A global shortage of diagnostic testing supplies at the time meant that researchers had to count some cases of COVID-19 in the study group based on symptoms alone.
“I’m sure people will come after it,” Boulware said, “but the data are what the data are.”
Critics on one side felt hydroxychloroquine was a wonder drug and that all study participants should receive it, while critics on the other side felt it was too dangerous to study, Boulware said. “In reality, it’s neither of them.”
The U also participated in a national trial of remdesivir, which has helped COVID-19 patients and received emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Supplies of the drug have been distributed by the federal government, which to date has sent 5,840 vials to Minnesota — enough to treat 500 to 1,000 people."
"June 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/respond-strongly-to-china-on-hong-kong/571028362/,StarTribune,Respond strongly to China on Hong Kong,"“Hide our strength, bide our time,” said Deng Xiaoping, China’s former leader. Xi Jinping, China’s current president, seems to believe the opposite.
Shaking off his failures that let an outbreak in Wuhan become a global coronavirus pandemic, Xi is quickening the crackdown on Hong Kong by championing a new national-security law that would allow China to severely limit the freedoms of speech, press and assembly, as well as judicial independence, that were guaranteed when the United Kingdom handed Hong Kong over in 1997. The rules were part of the Basic Law, which was supposed to allow Hong Kong to retain rights under a promised “one country, two systems” rubric. But like so much under the repressive regime, that was a lie.
On May 27, the U.S. State Department informed Congress that it no longer believed that Hong Kong had significant autonomy, a designation that was reflected in President Donald Trump’s decision to “begin the process” of ending portions of Hong Kong’s favorable economic status with the United States.
There is justifiable bipartisan anger over China’s increasingly aggressive and repressive regime. Chinese citizens aren’t just threatened in Hong Kong. More than 1 million Muslims have been been imprisoned in gulags — or worse — in Western China. Abroad, China’s territorial claims have led to maritime provocations; it is currently skirmishing with India over a long-festering border dispute; and it continues to menace Taiwan. Meanwhile, China maintains its predatory business and trade practices.
The bellicosity abroad reflects domestic weakness, including an export economy that’s ailing in the pandemic. Here in the U.S., China has become an increasingly important issue in the 2020 campaign, with both Trump and de facto Democratic nominee Joe Biden exchanging accusations about the other being “soft” on China.
The current climate is reminiscent of the run-up of the Cold War. But it would be unfortunate for the world to devolve back to that kind of conflict, especially when international cooperation is needed to tackle transnational challenges like climate change and, yes, the coronavirus.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on May 24, “It’s time for the United States to give up its wishful thinking on changing China.”
No, it’s not. The U.S. and its allies never gave up wishful thinking on the Soviet Union. But it’s important to remember what carried the West in the Cold War: ideals, international institutions and allies. All three have been eroded under Trump, including his announcement on Friday that the U.S. was withdrawing from the World Health Organization, ostensibly because of China’s influence on it, which would only solidify with this decision. And through a nationalist newspaper, China called out the U.S. for its “double standards” on Hong Kong and the growing protests over George Floyd’s killing. “Hong Kong’s rioters and police should carefully watch how the ‘democratic U.S.’ deals with the chaos in Minnesota,” the Global Times wrote.
Trump should continue America’s historic support for human rights and democracy abroad and better reflect them at home. And more than ever, the U.S. needs allies; alienating them through moves like the WHO defunding only strengthens China’s hand. Such hard issues, and not who is “soft” on China, should be the real debate this election season."
"June 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-seeks-federal-state-aid-for-mpls-as-early-estimate-shows-at-least-55m-in-damages/570984542/,StarTribune,"Mayor Frey seeks federal, state aid for Minneapolis, with early estimate showing at least $55M in damage","With at least $55 million in estimated damage and far more to come, Minneapolis will need state and federal aid as it attempts to rebuild hundreds of structures after the riots following George Floyd’s death, Mayor Jacob Frey said.
City officials are still putting together a complete tally of the destruction and cautioned that estimates are likely to rise significantly. Gov. Tim Walz and members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation are trying to get government assistance to offset that cost. But in the past, neither the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) nor Congress has consistently sent federal funding to cities ravaged by riots.
Minneapolis City Council members on Tuesday received an update from the city’s Community Planning & Economic Development department that estimated at least 220 buildings had been damaged, resulting in a minimum of $55 million in costs, though the city was “not yet ready to produce a credible estimate” of the losses.
Frey said in an interview that he expects the full cost of the damage to be “tens, if not hundreds of millions” of dollars, across both Twin Cities.
“We will do everything we can as we shift to recovery mode,” Frey said. “We’re recovering from crises sandwiched on top of each other, from COVID-19 to the police killing and then the looting which took place afterward.”
Walz said Tuesday that he is pushing for funding to rebuild damaged communities. His administration has been talking to U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, as well as U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar and Betty McCollum, who represent the Twin Cities. Walz said they have had conversations about seeking federal assistance to rebuild communities and “we have expressed some of our desires to explore what we can do there.”
After the 2015 riots in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan repeatedly sought about $19 million in aid from FEMA for public agencies that responded to the unrest. At the time, Hogan pointed to federal assistance provided to Los Angeles following the 1992 unrest over the beating of Rodney King. FEMA denied Hogan’s request.
McCollum expressed doubt about Minneapolis and St. Paul’s chances of getting federal disaster funding, a decision that is up to President Donald Trump. Alternatively, the state could seek funding through Congress’ annual appropriations, but that would require the Democratic-led House, Republican-led Senate and Trump to sign on.
“To be realistic, the odds of that happening are, at best, very difficult,” McCollum said in an e-mail.
Trump was harshly critical in a conference call with governors earlier in the week, calling them “weak” for not tamping down violent protests soon enough. Trump praised Minnesota’s use of the National Guard after several nights of escalating violence and looting.
McCollum urged Walz to seek a disaster declaration, particularly given law enforcement investigations into organized arson and looting.
“If it is demonstrated outside provocateurs committed acts of destruction then there is a clear rationale for an emergency declaration by President Trump,” she said.
Omar also said in a statement Wednesday that Minnesota cannot rely on Trump to dedicate FEMA resources.
“So Congress must step in,” she said. “I am working with my colleagues to create an Emergency Relief Fund specifically for communities trying to rebuild after social and civil rights crises.”
Walz also said he wants support for damaged areas along Lake Street in the state’s bonding bill to fund infrastructure. Minnesota legislators are scheduled to return to the State Capitol for a special session June 12. The session has been expected to focus on the bonding bill, as well as tax relief and COVID-19 spending.
“Whether you live in Mankato or whether you live in Roseau or you’re down in Winona, it’s in our best interest as a state that shares things together to make sure that community is rebuilt,” Walz said.
Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, and the Legislature’s People of Color and Indigenous Caucus made similar calls for state aid.
The bonding bill can’t be used to repair private businesses, but it could assist with fixing and rebuilding public buildings, such as libraries and police stations. Sen. David Senjem, chair of the committee that focuses on bonding in the Republican-led Senate, said he is open to acting quickly to include some of those needs in a borrowing bill.
The decisions about whether to provide aid could have a major impact on the city’s finances, which had already been strained by the coronavirus pandemic.
On Memorial Day, before Floyd died, city officials were discussing ways to cut $165 million from the budget as they tried to account for plummeting revenue and the increased costs of responding to the public health crisis. Frey and the City Council are expected to work together in the coming weeks to amend the 2020 budget.
“This will be a budget crunch. To say otherwise would be dishonest, but we are committed to the city,” Frey said. “We have a committed team, and I know between our city enterprise and the strength of our communities, we’re going to get through this.”"
"June 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/universal-savings-accounts-could-help-struggling-americans/571061082/,StarTribune,Universal savings accounts could help struggling Americans,"After pandemics and economic recessions, people tend to save a little more than they did before, to better prepare for future unknowns. To make savings a little easier, a new idea is gaining popularity: Universal savings accounts. USAs would help every American save for a rainy day, save to start a business or save to grow their family.
In the next coronavirus package, Congress should create an all-purpose savings account that would allow individuals to save for things other than just retirement, education and health care.
The existing system of savings accounts is designed for Americans who are wealthy enough to save for specific purposes and financially secure enough to know that their plans won’t change. USAs provide another option, allowing families to save for the unknowns in life, without government-imposed strings attached and without being penalized by the tax code.
According to a new report from Congress’s Joint Economic Committee: “USAs would assist families as they pursue their own savings goals throughout life.” They also note how additional savings promotes social capital — the networks of relationships and associations in society that bind us together — “whether it is used to start a family, to surround children with supportive neighbors or to shore up institutions of civil society.”
The National Coronavirus Recovery Commission, or NCRC, also recently recommended USAs as a critical policy for reducing the financial risks of future pandemics by allowing more Americans to save for future unknowns.
The U.S. tax code currently discourages the economic and social benefits of saving by taxing savers more heavily than individuals that spend their paychecks immediately. This savings disadvantage is lifted for specific government-approved savings goals, like employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement accounts and state-sponsored 529 education savings plans.
Government-approved saving accounts fail to meet the evolving needs of many lower-income and middle-class Americans. Low-income savers are 31% more likely to face additional tax penalties for improperly withdrawing their money during a personal financial crisis.
Complicated rules and high penalties for misusing government-earmarked savings discourage the use of the existing system.
A USA could provide the same savings protections available today, but without all the complicated strings attached. A single, simple and flexible account would help more families build financial security.
Individuals should be allowed to contribute at least $10,000 in post-tax earnings to their USA each year, and all withdrawals would be excluded from taxable income so that all accrued earning would be tax-free. The savings could be used at any time for any purpose.
Congress implicitly recognizes the failure of single-purpose savings accounts after almost every major natural disaster, by allowing affected Americans to draw on their retirement savings penalty-free.
In the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act passed in March, Congress suspended restrictions on using retirement funds for pandemic emergencies. They also waived requirements that would have forced some retirees to liquidate their investments at the bottom of the stock market crash.
These were sensible changes. But instead of addressing each crisis with an exception to the normal rules, Congress should create an all-purpose savings account to “help Americans build a personal rainy day fund so that they can better weather the risks of a future economic or health crisis,” as the NCRC explains.
Similar accounts have succeeded in promoting saving around the world. The United Kingdom and Canada pioneered the model of simple, flexible savings accounts to help more people save for their own priorities.
Forty percent of all households in Canada have saved money in these accounts, and more than half of those households are low-income savers. Forty-three percent of British adults hold an account, and similar to Canada, 50% of account holders earn less than 20,000 pounds sterling (about $26,000).
In future economic downturns, USAs would be particularly helpful for the lower-income workers who are often most affected by business closures and layoffs. Even with benefits like unemployment insurance, delays in processing are all too common in times of high applications. USAs can tide people over without becoming delinquent on other payments or relying on high-interest credit card debt or payday loans.
Lower-income individuals in Canada are more than twice as likely to have a USA-style account as opposed to a more restrictive retirement savings account.
When you tax something, you get less of it. Similarly, when you make something more complicated, you discourage its use. The current savings system does both; it overtaxes savers and enforces numerous complicated rules on those savers who can take advantage of government-approved savings goals.
With universal savings accounts, Congress can tax family savings less, allowing Americans to better prepare for their futures — rain or shine."

In the meantime, in an effort to minimize any further spread of the coronavirus, city Health Commissioner Gretchen Musicant told City Council members Friday that the city will set up additional testing sites.
Mznneapolis has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus, accounting for roughly 13% of the state’s COVID-19 cases, even though it has only 7.5% of the state’s population, according to the latest statistics released by the city.
As of Thursday evening, the city had 3,579 confirmed cases and 569 hospitalizations. The pandemic has killed 142 people in the city. Another 2,854, were considered recovered.
The state had been awaiting the local peak of the corona­virus pandemic before the nights of protests, riots and memorials began.
“We’re all looking for a leveling off,” Council Member Cam Gordon said during Friday’s public meeting.
He asked Musicant if there was evidence of that. She cautioned it was too early to tell. Data available so far largely reflects cases that were contracted before the large gatherings in Minneapolis.
“The state is seeing some positive turning of the peak, and so I’m hopeful that because we are contributing a significant amount to the statewide numbers, that our numbers are also doing that. But, we will have to wait and see,” she said. “It does give us some sense of hope, but we’ll see if that is well-placed.”
Musicant, presenting data available earlier in the week, told the council that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on black and Hispanic residents. A community advisory group is preparing a report on racial disparities in COVID-19 cases and expects to release it in the next couple weeks, she said.
For the first time, the city also released a breakdown of cases by neighborhood. That data showed that 10 neighborhoods recorded more than 100 cases each. Those neighborhoods were East Phillips, Midtown Phillips, Phillips West, Ventura Village, Lind-Bohanon, Willard-Hay, Cedar-Riverside, Whittier, Central and Powderhorn Park. Council members noted that those neighborhoods are some of the most densely populated, and the data only showed raw case counts, as opposed to the rate of infection in those areas.
“This is a reflection of where people live,” Musicant said. “They were not necessarily exposed where they live. They could be. Some of the exposures might be connected to their work.”
Musicant said, starting next week, city officials hope to have COVID-19 testing set up at Sabathani Community Center, Native American Community Clinic, New Salem Baptist Church and another yet-to-be-determined location near the Third Precinct police headquarters, which was the focal point for many of the recent demonstrations and riots. The state recently updated its guidelines to recommend testing for anyone involved in large gatherings, such as protests or cleanup events.
In addition, city officials are working with the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority and a private landlord to increase testing in the densely populated, predominantly black Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, home to a cluster of infections.
The city noted in a statement that it expects it will be three to four weeks before officials know the full impact of recent unrest and cleanup efforts on the COVID-19 pandemic. City officials said they expect gatherings to continue this weekend, the incubation period for the virus can be up to 14 days, and there can be up to a week delay between testing and reporting the results."
"June 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-mighty-u-s-dollar-is-having-a-wobble/571060592/,StarTribune,The mighty U.S. dollar is having a wobble,"The U.S. dollar is having a wobble, falling to its lowest level on a trade-weighted basis since March. It's a sign that the economic effects of the pandemic crisis are waning around the world. Perhaps it's time for the U.S. to rein in the unlimited economic stimulus, or at least keep some in reserve to fight specific fires rather than just ensuring market liquidity.
The Federal Reserve has saved the financial world with its unrelenting monetary packages, pumping in $3 trillion in the past three months.
It has met the soaring global demand for dollars, the haven currency in a crisis, and propped up the U.S. economy and a large swath of the developing world exposed to dollar borrowing. With oil prices regaining their footing, the immediate danger of an emerging markets collapse has passed.
The Fed has also done the job at home. The Nasdaq is within a squeak of its all-time peak, the S&P 500 is within 6% of its record high and corporate bond yields have fallen sharply. The mission to restore confidence in financial valuations is surely complete.
The flip side of this is that with interest rates at zero, the federal deficit soaring and U.S. bond yields barely above the rest of the developed world, there's not much incentive for investors to be parked in dollars. Washington's dispute with Beijing won't be helping, and neither will the civil unrest of recent days and the prospect of mass unemployment.
U.S. assets still have great appeal; the dollar's fall is merely the unwinding of a huge risk premium on other countries that favored the greenback. The danger for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is whether he has overdone the infinite liquidity and whether the recent lurch lower for the dollar turns into a rout. In fairness, the Fed has cut its daily bond purchases from $75 billion a day at one stage of the COVID-19 crisis into the single billions.
But the balance sheet effect of boosting the Fed's holdings by 70%, to more than $7 trillion, in such short order is hard to contain. No wonder the dollar has been a casualty. It wouldn't be a surprise if the Fed ceased daily stimulus soon to become much more selective in its asset purchases.
The dollar's weakness also reflects the relative strength of other currencies. Neither China nor Japan have conducted stimulus on anything like the same scale. The dollar's most-traded counterpart, the euro, has scored some notable wins recently. The European Union's still-to-be-agreed 750 billion-euro ($840 billion) recovery fund is a sign that euro-area unity might finally be happening.
Furthermore, the European Central Bank's pandemic QE program has been weighted substantially toward the eurozone's weakest link, Italy, helping the country's borrowing costs stay in touch with those of Germany.
The lifting of lockdowns across Europe — without much discernible effect on coronavirus infection rates, at least not yet — gives the sense that the recession may not be as deep as feared. The ECB has increased its balance sheet by less than 20% so far. That may check the recent euro strength, which would be welcomed by big local exporters such as Germany.
A weaker dollar might be just what the global economy needs to sustain a proper recovery, as it prevents a skew of capital flooding into just one liquid currency. Greater potential returns in emerging economies will reappear. Equally, it will be good news for U.S. exporters with global revenue. The Fed has done a stellar job so far. Now it has to manage the easing of its stimulus package successfully, too."
"June 5, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-signs-phillips-sponsored-update-of-forgivable-loans-for-small-businesses/571049252/,StarTribune,Trump signs Dean Phillips-sponsored update of forgivable loans for small businesses,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law a new version of the small-business loan program known as PPP that had been redesigned by Minnesota Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips and a Texas Republican colleague.
The new law, called the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, reshaped the forgivable loans Congress created in late March as the coronavirus pandemic forced many businesses to shut down and lay off workers.
It now lets businesses qualify for loan forgiveness up to $10 million if they meet certain criteria. And it extended the period in which business can spend funds in order to have them forgiven.
Businesses forced to shut down during the pandemic now have more leeway to pay rent, mortgages and other operating expenses with proceeds from the loans. Previously, a sizable portion of the loans were directed toward worker pay.
The law also suspends payroll taxes for small businesses.
Phillips has said the legislation arose from complaints he heard from struggling small-business owners in Minnesota who needed help but didn’t qualify for forgivable loans under the original rules of the program.
Trump signed the bill on the day that new unemployment data showed that the original construction of the program likely contributed to driving people back to work.
Since the original loans had to be used right away, and the funds started to arrive to small businesses in late April and early May, they helped create a net gain of 2.5 million jobs in May, the Labor Department reported.
Even so, the modification to the program proved wildly popular. Phillips crafted it with a conservative Republican House colleague, Chip Roy of Texas. The pair drummed up support from 55 trade groups, as well as small businesses.
The bill passed the House with just one dissenting vote and passed the Senate unanimously."
"June 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/lingering-crises-spark-challenges-to-gov-tim-walz-s-emergency-powers/571075882/,StarTribune,Lingering crises spark challenges to Gov. Tim Walz's emergency powers,"Wielding a little-known law often used during natural disasters, Gov. Tim Walz has closed down schools, bars, restaurants, theaters and stadiums to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Since the middle of March, he’s been able to temporarily suspend elective surgeries, halt evictions and shutter barbershops — just a smattering of the measures that have intruded deeply into the everyday lives of Minnesotans. All that was before the night curfews and National Guard mobilizations to check the violent protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
“What governors have available to them that the president does not is the full, legitimate authority of a sovereign government,” said James Hodge, an Arizona State University public health law professor who helped draft a model for emergency powers after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. “This is as strong as it gets in the United States.”
The pandemic — paired with the chaos that erupted in the Twin Cities after Floyd’s death — has triggered unprecedented use of the power in a short period of time. Walz extended a declaration of peacetime emergency in Minnesota three times in the past three months, making it the longest period of time residents have lived under a state of emergency since World War II. During that time, he has issued more executive orders in response to crises than the past four governors combined.
The jarring impact on daily life in Minnesota has brought new attention to Walz and the state’s emergency powers law, created nearly 70 years ago to give the governor the ability to respond quickly to crises. It has also unleashed a debate over whether the law is necessary to save lives in a crisis, or merely grants the governor unilateral power.
That authority — rarely questioned before — is being tested in the courts as business groups, conservative activists and churches push to change the law or undo Walz’s actions entirely. Republican legislators are also expected to challenge Walz’s use of emergency powers when they return to St. Paul for a special session on June 12.
“This was put in place years ago so in the event of some unforeseen catastrophe or disaster, the governor can act quickly. I don’t think anybody would have foresaw that one of these emergency powers’ situation would last 90 days,” said House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown.
Given some of the direst predictions about the COVID-19 pandemic, critics see no end in sight. “There’s probably a 50-50 chance that he’s still got emergency powers on December 31 of this year, and I think that’s shocking,” Daudt said.
It’s a debate that’s playing out across the nation, where governors in all 50 states have declared states of emergency to respond to the pandemic. The spreading chaos erupting in response to Floyd’s death has layered another crisis over it all.
The state’s current state of emergency is second in length only to World War II, when legislators granted the governor temporary crisis authority from 1943 until 1945. But it wasn’t until 1951, near the peak of the Cold War, when lawmakers decided to enshrine emergency powers into the law books, worried about looming national threats at the time of a possible nuclear attack.
Legislators expanded that power years later, giving governors the ability to declare peacetime emergencies for acts of nature, terrorist attacks or civil strife that endangers “life and property.” In an emergency, the governor can issue executive orders to marshal resources, call up the National Guard, suspend rules and establish new ones.
Gov. Tim Pawlenty used emergency powers to help with response to Hurricane Katrina and to call up the National Guard in 2007 after the I-35W bridge collapsed. Gov. Mark Dayton called an emergency to respond to threats of the Avian Flu in 2015. Throughout history, it’s most often tapped by governors to respond to natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes and storms.
But as the pandemic has worn on, Republicans in the Legislature have called for an end to some of Walz’s most sweeping actions, particularly his business closures and a stay-at-home order that lasted 51 days. That order directed Minnesotans to stay inside except for essential work and outdoor exercise.
The law limits the length of an emergency to only five days, but it can be extended for another 30-day period by approval from a group known as the Executive Council, made up of the state’s elected constitutional officers. Like Walz, all the current members are Democrats, adding a partisan dimension to the orders. Walz has extended his emergency three times, for a total of more than 90 days, and is expected to extend it for another 30 days on June 12, triggering the special session under law. When the Legislature comes back, lawmakers have power to reject an extension of the state of emergency, but only if both chambers vote to do so.
That’s unlikely with Democrats in control of the House arguing the powers have been necessary to protect the public health in an unprecedented situation. Plus, the state’s part-time Legislature isn’t always available to respond to a crisis, and their process — involving 201 elected officials — often moves slowly.
“It seems to me this is exactly what it’s for,” said House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley. “The Legislature is disputatious. We go there to fight and knock things around and work on them until there’s more consensus. It’s intentionally slow and cumbersome.”
Republicans who control the Senate want to gain explicit authority to approve any extension of an emergency, and House Republicans held out against massive infrastructure funding legislation in May in an effort to curb or end the powers Walz invoked for the COVID-19 emergency.
But if legislators don’t reach an agreement on use of the powers, the courts could decide for them.
Two churches are suing Walz over restrictions on services, arguing they violate their First Amendment rights, and a group of conservative legislators has filed a lawsuit contending that the governor does not have the authority to suspend constitutional rights with executive actions. A lawsuit brought by business groups was dismissed by the Minnesota Court of Appeals on jurisdictional grounds.
Erick Kaardal, a frequent litigator against government, said Minnesota’s emergency powers law gets it wrong by asking the Legislature to step in after the fact, when the Constitution says they’re the body that creates laws and the governor signs off.
“This has it backward, you have the cart before the horse,” said Kaardal, the attorney on both the business and legislative lawsuits. “It’s a constitutional clown show.”
In Wisconsin, Republican legislators sued to undo Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ lockdown restrictions, arguing he exceeded his executive authority. But Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says he believes the governor is on solid legal ground, citing a 1905 case in Massachusetts in which the United States Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws.
The coronavirus is no different, he argues.
“As long as these numbers are climbing, as long as these actions are designed to slow and stop the spread and mitigate harm,” they are legitimate, Ellison said. “The point is not to curtail people’s freedom or movements or rights or whatever they want to do, the point is to save lives.”"
"June 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-walz-reopening-restrictions-restaurants-salons-gyms-pools-june-10-covid-coronavirus/571048092/,StarTribune,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz loosening restrictions on restaurants, salons, gyms, pools June 10","Indoor restaurants, swimming pools, movie theaters, fitness clubs and other venues can resume limited business Wednesday as Gov. Tim Walz continues to dial back restrictions designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The governor’s announcement Friday came amid indicators that the pandemic has at least temporarily “plateaued” in Minnesota, though state officials expect the corona­virus that causes COVID-19 to be a concern for months.
“COVID is still with us,” Walz said, “but we gotta live with it.”
No venues, indoor or outdoor, can host more than 250 people at once under the new guidance, but the level of reopening beyond that depends on the industry or activity. Churches, hair salons and indoor bars and restaurants can serve up to 50% of their capacities, while fitness centers, bowling alleys and movie theaters can serve 25% of their capacities as they reopen for the first time in more than two months.
With almost all businesses other than large concert and sporting venues allowed to resume, the more pressing statistic than building capacity is how many people they can serve while keeping unrelated groups 6 feet apart, said Steve Grove, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development.
The risk of transmitting the novel coronavirus increases when people are face to face within 6 feet for 10 or more minutes, so businesses will need to maintain social distancing for workers and customers, Grove said.
“Social distancing … is the bedrock principle of every single move that is made across this dial,” Grove said.
Outdoor gatherings of 25 people and indoor gatherings of 10 people can now take place, as long as social distancing is observed, paving the way for small, belated graduation celebrations.
Some competitive youth and adult recreational sports can resume but only if that spacing can be maintained. Tennis matches might be OK, but basketball games would present problems.
“You’d be a pretty bad basketball player if you’re 6 feet apart from the person you are trying to defend,” said Grove, who deferred to the state’s COVID-19 web page for guidance on major summer sports such as baseball and soccer.
The announcement came as the Minnesota Department of Health reported 33 deaths and 712 newly confirmed cases of the infectious disease on Friday — an uptick from the daily numbers that had declined earlier in the week.
Case counts are now only doubling every 27 days in Minnesota — far less than the state’s warning threshold of seven days.
“Something rather significantly changed from the second half of April, where we were really seeing … logarithmic growth [in COVID-19 cases], to now this pattern of more of a plateau with small waves within it,” said state Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm.
Case counts surged around the Memorial Day weekend, and Twin Cities hospitals reported running out of ICU space. But the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 as of Friday was the lowest since May 17.
The improving situation fueled criticisms that Walz should remove restrictions entirely and let businesses decide for themselves what safety measures to install.
“We’ve got to get over the fear of this virus. … We have to learn to live our lives,” said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake.
The toll of the pandemic in Minnesota now stands at 26,980 known cases and 1,148 deaths, including 922 deaths of mostly elderly residents of long-term care and assisted-living facilities. Gazelka said restrictions should shift to this most vulnerable population only.
Restaurant owners supported Walz’s move, although some felt whiplash after quickly creating or expanding outdoor dining areas to be ready by June 1, only to have indoor dining allowed June 10.
“I am as excited as can be,” said Phil Weber, owner of the Park Tavern Bowling and Entertainment Center in St. Louis Park, where revenue declined 90% despite providing takeout food. “I get people calling all the time asking, ‘Is your bowling open? Is your restaurant?’ ”
Consumer confidence could be fragile, so Brian Ingram of Hope Breakfast Bar in St. Paul said he hoped restaurants would make serious efforts to protect consumers and workers from infection.
He said he spent $30,000 getting ready with plexiglass partitions to separate tables and touchless fixtures in bathrooms.
“If one gets a bad reputation, it hurts all of us,” he said.
Some businesses were ready to reopen, while others needed time. Life Time had opened some fitness clubs nationally already and plans to open all 23 Minnesota locations on Wednesday.
Wearing of non-medical-grade masks is still encouraged, because of the high number of people with asymptomatic infections who can spread the coronavirus without knowing it. Restaurant servers must wear them, and stylists and their customers must both wear them.
A wave of COVID-19 cases is likely as people come in closer contact with one another, but whether it will be enough to result in renewed restrictions is unclear.
“We likely will be dealing with ongoing high levels of COVID-19 transmission for the months to come,” said Malcolm, noting that a sudden steep decline in cases now could be a bad sign of a second wave that mimics the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919.
Of particular concern is the spread of the virus among the thousands of protesters who turned out to the Minneapolis and St. Paul streets over the last week following the May 25 death of George Floyd while he was in police custody.
Singing, shouting and even labored breathing amid police use of tear gas to disperse protesters could have hastened the spread, Malcolm said. On the other hand, the outdoor air could have diffused the virus and reduced the threat of infection.
Health officials also are concerned that many protesters are black and that black people have suffered a higher rate of severe COVID-19. Black people make up less than 7% of Minnesota’s population but more than 20% of its COVID-19 hospitalizations.
Black people suffer higher rates of chronic disease, which exacerbates COVID-19, but also are at higher risk of infection because they are employed in many essential, lower-wage jobs and can’t work from home, Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said.
Mobile COVID-19 testing sites are being developed to provide easier access for minorities or low-wage workers with less access to health care, she said.
Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3, but doctors said his asymptomatic case likely did not play a role in his death while restrained by police via a chokehold — and was more a symbolic reminder of a health inequity for black Minnesotans.
Critical businesses that were never required to close under Walz’s prior stay-at-home order, which ended May 18 after 51 days, must now develop social distancing plans to minimize the risk of virus transmission for workers and customers, Grove said. People who can work from home will still be encouraged to do so, he added.
Increased testing is a key part of Minnesota’s revised strategy. The state twice this week exceeded 10,000 daily COVID-19 tests — an amount that was unthinkable amid global supply shortages in the early stages of the pandemic.
Health officials emphasized on Friday that any protesters, first responders and volunteers should get tested for COVID-19, regardless of whether they have symptoms, five to seven days after participating in any mass events following Floyd’s death.
The primary purpose of the business closures and social distancing restrictions was to slow the spread of the virus and buy time for health care providers to add testing capacity, ventilators and masks and other protective equipment for doctors and nurses.
Hospitals in response added hundreds of intensive care beds and ventilators to the state’s emergency supply.
Hospital officials remain concerned about a surge of cases that could overwhelm their capacities but support the easing of restrictions as long as they can be reinstated if necessary, said Dr. Rahul Koranne, chief executive of the Minnesota Hospital Association."
"June 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mysterious-condition-linked-to-covid-19-and-kids/571115382/,StarTribune,Mysterious condition linked to COVID-19 and kids,"Amid the escalating volume of calls to reopen Minnesota and the nation, it's important to sound a note of caution. We still have much to learn about the new strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and it's important not to lose sight of that even as normal life resumes.
A mysterious new condition in children is a worrisome warning to not become overconfident in the battle against this virus. As the pandemic unfolded, one silver lining has been that the virus had gone easier on children. Those 19 and under can be infected, but deaths in this age group are rare, and none have occurred in Minnesota.
Recent developments, however, suggest that children infected with the virus can later develop a serious illness called ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome,"" often abbreviated as MIS-C. The condition, thankfully, remains rare. Reported cases in Europe and the U.S. are in the hundreds, not thousands, said Dr. Anu Kalaskar, an infectious disease specialist with Children's Minnesota hospitals and clinics. Five cases, none of them fatal, had been reported in Minnesota as of Friday.
The condition's emergence here and elsewhere illustrates how much is still unknown about the virus's impact on health. In mid-May, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent out a health alert advising medical providers about MIS-C and providing a case definition to help them identify it. MIS-C's name describes what happens to those who develop it. What Kalaskar calls a ""hyperinflammatory process"" can occur after infection with COVID-19 even if the child didn't feel sick initially. The condition is similar to the rare pediatric condition called Kawasaki disease.
Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue, according to the CDC. The condition can take a serious turn when the inflammation affects multiple organ systems, Kalaskar said. Supportive care is available, but there isn't a specific treatment.
The CDC urges parents to watch kids carefully as COVID-19 continues and to seek medical advice ""immediately"" if they have concerns about their child's health. Kalaskar also emphasizes that MIS-C is rare and serious cases of it even more so.
Gov. Tim Walz's decision last week to further ease social distancing will allow Minnesotans to go back to health clubs, dine inside restaurants and enjoy bigger gatherings with friends and family. MIS-C's emergence should prompt continued coronavirus vigilance even as we return to public life."
"June 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/if-minnesota-emergency-order-lifts-friday-flood-of-evictions-foreclosures-will-likely-follow/571104212/,StarTribune,"If Minnesota emergency order lifts Friday, flood of evictions, foreclosures will likely follow","Kelvin Cannon had a job as a cook when the state of Minnesota ordered restaurants closed to help stop the spread of COVID-19.
That was March.
Since then, Cannon has not been able to find another job and does not qualify for unemployment because he was within the probationary employment period at the restaurant. The 28-year-old Minneapolis man cannot pay his rent and struggles to meet many other living expenses.
One reason he still has a roof over his head is Gov. Tim Walz’s executive order declaring a peacetime emergency, which forbids evictions.
But when that ends — which could be as early as Friday — and protections built into a federal COVID-19 response law expire in July, Cannon and thousands of Minnesotans like him could be served, resulting in an explosion of delayed evictions and foreclosures, consumer advocates said.
Added to that, other forms of debt collection delayed by suspended court hearings will start again. As people max out credit cards to pay bills due, more debt could pile up.
Minnesota averages 13,000 to 15,000 eviction filings a year, said Eric Hauge, who helps run Home Line, a nonprofit legal hotline that advises Minnesota renters. “There could be that many filed in the first few weeks after the emergency order lifts,” he said.
Hauge said callers normally ask how to get landlords to make repairs. Since the pandemic and accompanying shutdowns drove the state’s economy into a downward spiral, renters have shifted their questions.
Now they want to know about “financial assistance, threats of lockouts and lease nonrenewals,” he said.
In May, the bill-paying firm Doxo issued a report on the impact of COVID-19. The company — which counts Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as a partner — found that roughly 7 in 10 households do not have enough savings to last four months, and one in three could last only one month without running short of cash.
One in three households were either already paying bills late or would have to in the next month.
Hauge said Home Line has heard of people who pay their rent first but cannot pay other bills. He has also heard of people paying rent with credit cards.
In Minneapolis, Cannon is tapped out and out of options.
He qualified for a stimulus payment under the federal pandemic response law, but child support enforcement officials seized the check because Cannon, who said he paid support when he had a job, owed money.
Cannon said he was within the 90-day probationary period when he lost his job as a cook at an Indian restaurant. He said state officials told him his probationary status disqualified him from receiving unemployment payments.
“I look for jobs online,” said Cannon, who is now three months behind on his rent. “I’ve had a couple of interviews, but no callbacks. I’ve been applying for warehouse jobs, cooking jobs, customer-service jobs. I don’t have a plan for paying my bills because I can’t work and I can’t get help.”
Now, he added, he worries the damage done by riots after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody will further impede his search.
Jerry Essary, 52, is a felon and self-described “bad boy gone good.” He quit a temporary construction job in January in Wisconsin and moved back full time to Sauk Centre because he became a full-time single parent to his 9-year-old son, Colton. Then, the pandemic hit and the job market dried up.
A former construction boss who planned to hire him ran out of money and “got scared of COVID-19,” Essary said. “Everybody I talked with was either laying off people or not hiring.”
He found work in a meatpacking plant that promptly experienced an outbreak of coronavirus after his hiring. Since then, all he has found is a weeklong job unloading trucks.
Because he quit his construction job for personal reasons, Essary said the state told him he didn’t qualify for unemployment. His stimulus check went for back child support for another child.
Since March, Essary said, he has not paid rent on the house where he has lived for five and a half years. The monthly rent is $750. He and his son are trying to live on $625 a month in welfare payments.
“I don’t know how different it would be without the pandemic,” he said. “I was already behind. But once the pandemic hit, I was screwed.”
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said landlords have been largely compliant with the noneviction order and that there have been relatively few utility cutoffs during the pandemic. But Ellison, like many, fears an explosion of people displaced from housing, ruined credit and court-ordered judgments in the pandemic’s wake.
The state needs provisions to help with COVID-driven rent problems, bankruptcy and credit scores, he said.
The consumer-advocacy community is gearing up for a major battle over unpaid bills. Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid recently conducted a webinar for lawyers about renters’ rights.
About 150 lawyers participated in the webinar, said Jennifer Singleton, program manager for legal services. “Usually, those draw 30 to 40 lawyers,” she said.
Home buyers who miss mortgage payments because of the pandemic are supposed to be able to request loan extensions to make up for delinquencies if they have federally backed loans, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
People with conventional loans do not receive that protection, although in Minnesota, Walz requested that mortgage holders delay foreclosures during the emergency.
Statistics gathered by the advocacy group Minnesota Homeownership Center show that the number of preforeclosure filings actually decreased in the first quarter of 2020 to 4,200 from 4,800 in the last quarter of 2019. Center officials warn that the impact of the pandemic on mortgage payments is unlikely to show up until this summer or fall because foreclosures generally lag missed payments by several months, plus the first quarter had only a fraction of the time under stay-home orders.
The center is “gearing up” for an explosion, said director Julie Gugin.
However, the center’s ultimate explanation to those in arrears on mortgages will likely be the same that delinquent renters and others behind on bills will get:
At some point, most people and companies that lend money, lease property or offer credit have a legal right to get paid back.
“Part of our advising process is to figure out what consumers want,” Gugin said. “If you want to stay in your home, your income has to support the mortgage payments. If you have to leave, you try to negotiate a soft landing. Lower payments may be viable. Increased income may be viable. But could some people lose homes? Yes.”
Debt-collection cases in Minnesota have not yet become a source of contention, said Legal Aid’s Singleton. In fact, Walz issued a specific executive order banning creditors from garnishing pandemic response stimulus checks because the money was supposed to go for future support, not past debt.
But the nation’s doubling of debt-collection cases, documented recently by the Pew Charitable Trusts, suggests a flood of backed-up filings because of the pandemic. The lack of debt-collection complaints to Legal Aid, said Singleton, is likely a function of the judicial system’s decision to delay hearing court cases, not a reduction in those cases.
Ron Elwood, a supervising attorney at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, thinks debt cases brought to court by lawyers for creditors against absent or unrepresented borrowers “is a monster that needs to be tamed.” Instead, it will likely get worse.
“The pandemic,” said Elwood, “is exacerbating what is already happening.”"
"June 9, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-department-of-health-releases-data-on-covid-19-deaths-in-long-term-care/571120402/,StarTribune,Minnesota Department of Health releases data on COVID-19 deaths in long-term care,"Amid mounting public pressure, the Minnesota Department of Health released stark new data on the deadly impact of the novel coronavirus on long-term care facilities across the state.
The data were released late Friday in response to a threat of a legislative subpoena by a prominent lawmaker and provide the most detailed look yet into the types of long-term care facilities where people are dying of the virus and the state’s efforts to contain its spread through more aggressive testing and inspections.
As public health experts had warned, residents and staff of Minnesota’s nursing homes are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, the deadly respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, accounting for two-thirds of all deaths in long-term care. As of June 1, nursing homes reported 2,973 cases and 608 deaths from the virus statewide. Assisted-living facilities, which typically provide a less-intensive level of care, had 1,243 cases and 259 deaths, the state said. Another 29 residents have died of the virus in specialized memory care units, the agency said.
Large and deadly clusters of the virus have begun appearing in more nursing homes, where a combination of factors — chronic understaffing, infection-control problems, tight living quarters and a frail population — have contributed to the virus’ spread.
In Minnesota, nursing homes house and care for about half as many residents as less regulated assisted-living facilities. However, they tend to care for older people with more underlying health conditions. They also have more dense physical layouts, with residents often doubled up in rooms and as many as four people sharing a single bathroom. The hospital-like design of many nursing homes was intended to be cost-efficient, but it has contributed to the rapid spread of the virus, public health experts maintain.
The nursing homes that have been hit hardest are St. Therese of New Hope, with 67 deaths, and North Ridge Health and Rehab, also of New Hope, with 57 deaths. Another 38 people have died at Southview Acres Healthcare Center in West St. Paul; and 29 have died at Augustana Chapel View Care Center in Hopkins, according to the state data released Friday.
The information released Friday follows on the heels of a trove of data released last week by the federal government, which also included facility-level information on COVID-19 outbreaks. For the first time, members of the public can search by nursing home facility name on the federal website Nursing Home Compare to identify the scope of the outbreaks in specific facilities. However, the federal data exclude assisted-living facilities, which are part of the state’s report.
Until the state released this accounting, families with relatives in long-term care had repeatedly been denied information on the size of the COVID-19 outbreaks in specific facilities. Without such data, some families argued, they had difficulty making informed decisions about where to place their loved ones. In some cases, residents and families said facilities did not tell them that COVID-19 had spread widely in their facilities, making it impossible to avoid the contagion.
The Department of Health had initially withheld information on the scope of outbreaks in individual long-term care facilities, citing concerns that it could potentially expose the identities of those infected. The agency relented, however, after weeks of public pressure from senior advocacy groups and state Sen. Karin Housley, R-St. Mary’s Point, who oversees a Senate aging committee. Frustrated by what she considered a lack of response to her inquiries, Housley wrote a letter to Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm threatening to subpoena her agency if it did not comply with requests for more facility-level data.
Since early April, Housley has been pushing for more disclosure and universal COVID-19 testing in long-term care facilities. She expects to introduce legislation in the upcoming special session that would mandate the state to pay for the testing with the $1.87 billion in federal funds Minnesota has received to cover coronavirus-related costs.
“I sincerely appreciate Commissioner Malcolm’s timely response to my letter,” Housley said in a statement. “However, it’s also clear the [Walz] administration should consider a more transparent approach when it comes to public disclosure. Perhaps never more than in a public health crisis, Minnesotans have a right to know what is happening.”
The Department of Health also released information on hundreds of infection-control surveys it has conducted of nursing homes since late March, when the agency shifted its priority toward infection control during inspections. Currently, 29% of facilities surveyed were found to be out of compliance with infection prevention and control guidelines and were issued citations, the state said.
Lawmakers and elder care advocates have also raised concerns about transfers of COVID-19 patients from hospitals and other facilities into long-term care. The practice has been widespread. All told, 319 of the 863 facilities with COVID-19 outbreaks have had an infected patient transfer from another facility or discharged back to the facility from a hospital, state records show.
The Department of Health said, in its response to Housley, that “there are no facilities whose outbreaks started because they accepted a COVID-positive patient from a hospital.”"
"June 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-economy-chief-steve-grove-was-tasked-to-focus-on-the-innovation-economy-then-everything-hit/571148542/,StarTribune,Minnesota's economy chief Steve Grove was tasked to focus on the 'innovation economy.' Then everything hit,"It had been more than two months since the coronavirus pandemic threw Minnesota’s economy into chaos, and only days before George Floyd’s death would introduce a new sort of tumult to the Twin Cities. Weekdays and weekends were blending into each other, all consumed by work. Steve Grove needed a break.
On a beautiful Saturday afternoon in late May, Grove, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, hopped on his bicycle in Linden Hills and, with his 3-year-old twins towed in a bike trailer, went for a ride. Near the Lake Harriet Band Shell, they paused for ice cream and cheese curds. His wife, Mary, watched the twins throw flower petals into the lake while Grove made a few phone calls in advance of the governor’s announcement of a phased reopening of churches that afternoon.
However briefly, it felt like they were human again.
Then they loaded the kids back up. Mint chocolate chip ice cream fell to the ground. Their bike fell over, twice. And on the ride back home, the skies opened up, a colossal downpour drenched Grove and his wife from head to toe as the kids screamed in delight from the shelter of their trailer.
This was not the plan.
For the former Google executive, who took over as the state’s economic czar in 2019 after returning to his home state the year before, not much has been going according to plan these days. It certainly was not the plan to, in a few chaotic months, shift from near record-low unemployment and a focus on the “innovation economy” to a time where the state’s and nation’s economies resemble the Great Depression more than any time since World War II.
“The idea that anybody who’s here to help grow the economy would have to focus on pausing the economy for the sake of public health is really unfathomable,” Grove said. “But it’s what this time required, and ultimately it’s what we needed to do to keep our economy safe. It’s not just public health or the economy on an either-or spectrum. It’s all interrelated. And that’s what makes this so challenging.”
It also was never the plan to, in the midst of this pandemic, be visiting with Lake Street businesses destroyed by fires and looting that caused an estimated $100 million to $150 million in damage to buildings in Minneapolis alone, according to preliminary city numbers. In person and on Zoom calls, Grove has spoken with business owners affected by the destruction when protests after Floyd’s death turned violent, as well as legislative and city leaders.
He asks what the businesses need. At first, the most pressing need was security. Eventually, they say, they’ll need funds to rebuild, and assurances that the rebuilding process will not gentrify these economically diverse neighborhoods. The message: “You better get this right this time.”
There’s been the same feeling with the economic fallout of the pandemic: The Walz administration better get it right, though there are no obvious solutions.
Since the virus paralyzed America in March, the ongoing discussions in the Walz administration and in state governments throughout the country have been a push-pull between the desire to restart an economy that locked down for much of spring and the pressing public health concerns over the spread of a mysterious new virus.
In Walz’s cabinet meetings on Zoom, Grove tends to be more aggressive on the economy than Jan Malcolm, public health commissioner. But there have been plenty of times when Grove makes public health arguments while Malcolm makes economic arguments.
Grove started having weekly calls in March with a dozen or so economic leaders — heads of large corporations, owners of smaller businesses, labor leaders — to get their unvarnished (and confidential) thoughts on the state government’s latest moves. In these calls, he tries to take a weekly temperature from business leaders and present those thoughts to the governor.
“You need to hear the good, the bad and the ugly, otherwise you’re the emperor with no clothes on,” said Mark Urdahl, president and CEO of Red Wing Shoe Co. “And nobody wants to be that.”
According to those on Grove’s weekly calls, the commissioner mostly just listens. Before the June 1 reopening of restaurants and hair salons, he asked for input on the state’s plan. It was too cumbersome and detailed, business leaders told him, and needed to be pared down for overwhelmed business owners. So the state revised it to be more straightforward.
“I don’t hear political rhetoric, but I do hear an increasing urgency from people and a concern for the communities they live in,” said Traci Tapani, co-president of Wyoming Machine, a contract manufacturing company in Stacy.
“People realize we can’t stay locked down forever,” said Rod Young, CEO and president of Delta Dental of Minnesota, a dental insurance company. “They also realize that coming back too soon could be a challenge.”
What Grove and others in state government know is there are no perfect decisions with COVID-19. That’s why Walz refers to it as a dial; it’s a delicate balance of slowly reopening the economy while minding public health concerns. And when nationwide protests over Floyd’s death have their epicenter in the Twin Cities, and bring thousands of people in close physical contact, that delicate balance can burst in a matter of days.
The most difficult decisions have had to do with small businesses; when Grove was growing up in Northfield, his dad owned a landscaping company with a half-dozen employees. Decisions about shutting down small businesses have been excruciating.
“For a business that’s not open, these are their lives for them, food on their table,” Grove said. “To say you’re a noncritical business — noncritical? Noncritical to who?
“There are lots of fairness questions there are not good answers to,” he continued. “This whole issue for several weeks, small retailers saying to us, ‘I don’t understand why Walmart is cranking in the revenue and I can’t be open.’ They’re 100 percent right. In the bigger picture, there’s a reason. … But there’s no perfect decision.”
Grove kept hearing complaints about Minnesota’s Largest Candy Store in Jordan. It stayed open because it sells food — but as the huge sign says next to the highway, it’s a candy store.
As the pandemic has worn on, the definition of what is “critical” has crumbled, Grove said, as many businesses permanently shuttered and the national unemployment rate skyrocketed. Last week, nearly 2 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment. But some hopeful notes came Friday, when the Labor Department announced improving unemployment numbers — from 14.7% in April to 13.3% in May — and that employers had added 2.5 million jobs in May.
The June 1 phase of the economy’s reopening was disrupted by the violence. But state government remains on edge to see if Minnesota has struck the right balance. Another marker comes on Wednesday, when the dial increases again: limited indoor dining, indoor entertainment at movie theaters and other venues, fitness club usage, and outdoor entertainment of up to 250 people.
“When I say getting it right, if we open retail and the whole state decides there’s no reason to take precautions, that’s our biggest concern,” Grove said. “It’s summer. We’re trying to loosen this. [The June 1 reopening] is really tough because it’s no longer a stay-at-home order.
“Did we nail the decision right, so that people can get back to it but do it in a safe way, where we don’t get overwhelmed?”
This time, Grove hopes things go according to plan."
"June 10, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/jobless-minnesota-students-press-for-unemployment-benefits-in-pandemic/571132282/,StarTribune,Jobless Minnesota students press for unemployment benefits in pandemic,"Walter Cortina has worked since he was 14, doing stints at McDonald’s and a local car wash. But when the 17-year-old student from Minneapolis was laid off in March amid the coronavirus pandemic, he found out he didn’t qualify for unemployment benefits because he was still in high school.
“That was very scary for me. I was like, what am I going to do to make money?” said Cortina, who also is barred from receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal initiative specifically for those who do not qualify for traditional unemployment.
Cortina was one of five Minnesota students who testified before the Legislature recently to push for a law that would temporarily expand unemployment benefits to high schoolers who have been working. Though they are hoping for action in the special session that begins this week, they have been given no assurances.
Meanwhile, the pandemic economy continues to take its toll on Cortina and possibly thousands of other young workers who depend on their wages to help their families, save for college, or simply survive.
Cortina, a junior at St. Paul’s High School for Recording Arts, supports his aunt and his mother, who was deported to Mexico along with his father. Both his aunt and his mother have battled breast cancer, and Cortina, now staying with his aunt, has experienced homelessness.
His position might not be as dire as some others. After six weeks of job hunting, Cortina recently secured a paid internship at the Minneapolis Foundation.
“Without that, I don’t know how I’d be getting through right now,” Cortina said.
He worries for other students who may be unable to pay rent, stay in school, or even buy groceries without a job during the pandemic.
A 1939 Minnesota state law bars high school students from receiving unemployment insurance. The state’s prohibition is one of the strictest in the country, said D.C. unemployment insurance expert Andrew Stettner. Unemployment guidelines in other Midwestern states such as Iowa, Indiana and Ohio treat high school students like any other workers, allowing them access to benefits. Michigan does not typically provide high schoolers with unemployment benefits but grants them access to federal pandemic benefits, Stettner said.
Amid a pandemic that has swelled the ranks of the unemployed, high school students in the state who need to support themselves or pay for college are asking state lawmakers to change the law, at least for the duration of Gov. Tim Walz’s COVID-19 emergency, which will be debated in the upcoming special session.
State Rep. Mohamud Noor has been working to expand benefits for young people since the start of the pandemic, a time when scores of young workers employed in industries most affected by the business shutdowns have also been left out of the federal stimulus package. He believes that providing benefits to working students is the least the state can do during this time.
“If they are old enough to be employed, then they are old enough to receive unemployment,” Noor said.
The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development does not track the number of unemployed high school students. But a group of students pressing for change estimates that 10,000 Minnesota high school students have lost jobs due to the pandemic and may be in need of benefits. The coalition’s Facebook group, called “Don’tForgetUsCampaign,” has more than 200 members.
Cortina and several other students in the coalition testified earlier this month in a virtual hearing of the House Jobs and Economic Development Finance Division. The hearing was informational and the students were given no promises that their cause would be taken up in the DFL-controlled House, let alone the Republican-run Senate.
The House committee also heard from recent Roosevelt High School graduate Cole Stevens, who said he received Pandemic Unemployment Assistance but was later asked to return it because it covered a period when he was still in school. The 18-year-old said he needed the funds when they came in, as he has helped his father with bills since 2018 with money earned from working at a Bloomington coffee shop and freelance bike and audio work.
“I was already behind on bills by then, so I spent that money, and then they asked for it back like two days later,” Stevens said.
A judge recently ruled that he can receive benefits after graduation. But state officials are still requesting he return money, which amounts to more than $3,700.
“They’re trying to put a young kid in debt to the state right off the bat, straight out of high school,” said Stevens, who is appealing his case.
Graduation is still a week away for Minneapolis student Lincoln Bacal. During the House hearing, she spoke of students who won’t be able to wait until graduation and may be pressured to drop out of school.
“I just think it’s very unjust. The federal government created this fund [Pandemic Unemployment Assistance] specifically for people like me, and then Minnesota decides, no, we’re not actually going to allow this money to go back into our state and back into our youth that would eventually help the economy,” Bacal said in an interview.
Even as Walz relaxes restrictions on businesses closed during the pandemic, many young employees are among the last to be rehired. Before the pandemic, Bacal worked at Sebastian Joe’s, a popular ice cream shop in Uptown. Though the business has reopened with limited hours and seating, it is unlikely that they will return her to the schedule, she said.
“Even if I had wanted to work this summer, they don’t have me on the schedule, so I probably won’t be able to work there until next fall, if not later,” Bacal said. “So that sort of threw my plans out of whack.”"
"June 11, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/learn-to-love-trillion-dollar-deficits/571189082/,StarTribune,Learn to love trillion-dollar deficits,"Last week, a bipartisan group of 60 members of the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to congressional leadership, raising concerns about mounting debt and deficits that have come as a result of the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. “We cannot ignore the pressing issue of the national debt,” they wrote. The letter warned of “irreparable damage to our country” if nothing is done to stem the tide of red ink. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, echoed their concerns.
It’s an ominous sign for the smaller businesses and millions of unemployed Americans whose survival may very well depend on continued government support in this crisis. While these Democratic and Republican lawmakers stopped short of calling for immediate austerity measures, their remarks demonstrate that they have fallen prey to what I call the deficit myth: that our nation’s debt and deficits are on an unsustainable path and that we need to develop a plan to fix the problem.
As a proponent of what’s called Modern Monetary Theory and as a former chief economist for the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, intimately familiar with how public finance actually works, I am not worried about the recent multitrillion-dollar surge in spending.
But there was a time when it would have rattled me too.
I understand the deficit myth because in the early part of my career in economics I, too, bought into the conventional way of thinking. I was taught that the federal government should manage its finances in ways that resemble good old-fashioned household budgeting, that it should hold spending in line with revenue and avoid adding debt whenever possible.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain — President Ronald Reagan’s partner in the conservative revolution of the late 20th century — captured these sentiments in a seminal speech in 1983, declaring that “the state has no source of money other than the money people earn themselves. If the state wishes to spend more, it can only do so by borrowing your savings or by taxing you more.”
That thinking sounds reasonable to people, including me when I first absorbed it. But Thatcher’s articulation of the deficit myth concealed a crucial reality: the monetary power of a currency-issuing government. Governments in nations that maintain control of their own currencies — like Japan, Britain and the United States, and unlike Greece, Spain and Italy — can increase spending without needing to raise taxes or borrow currency from other countries or investors. That doesn’t mean they can spend without limit, but it does mean they don’t need to worry about “finding the money,” as many politicians state, when they wish to spend more. Politics aside, the only economic constraints currency-issuing states face are inflation and the availability of labor and other material resources in the real economy.
It is true that in a bygone era, the U.S. government didn’t have full control of its currency. That’s because the U.S. dollar was convertible into gold, which forced the federal government to constrain its spending to protect the stock of its gold reserves. But President Richard Nixon famously ended the gold standard in August 1971, freeing the government to take full advantage of its currency-issuing powers. And yet, roughly a half-century later, top political leaders in the U.S. still talk as Thatcher did and legislate as if we, the taxpayers, are the ultimate source of the government’s money.
In 1997, during my early training as a professional economist, someone shared a little book titled “Soft Currency Economics” with me. Its author, Warren Mosler, a successful Wall Street investor, argued that when it came to money, debt and taxes, our politicians (and most economists) were getting almost everything wrong. I read it and wasn’t convinced. One of Mosler’s claims was that the money the government collects isn’t directly used to pay its bills. I had studied economics with world-renowned economists at Cambridge University, and none of my professors had ever said anything like that.
In 1998, I visited Mosler at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla., where I spent hours listening to him explain his thinking. He began by referring to the U.S. dollar as “a simple public monopoly.” Since the U.S. government is the sole issuer of the currency, he said, it was silly to think of Uncle Sam as needing to get dollars from the rest of us.
My head spun. Then he told me a story: Mosler had a beautiful beachfront property and all the luxuries of life anyone could hope to enjoy. He also had a family that included two teenagers, who resisted doing household chores. Mosler wanted the yard mowed, the beds made, the dishes done, the cars washed and so on. To encourage them to help out, he promised to compensate them by paying for their labor with his business cards. Nothing much got done.
“Why would we work for your business cards? They’re not worth anything!” they told him. So Mosler changed tactics. Instead of offering to compensate them for volunteering to pitch in around the house, he demanded a payment of 30 of his business cards, each month, with some chores worth more than others. Failure to pay would result in a loss of privileges: no more TV, use of the swimming pool or shopping trips to the mall.
Mosler had essentially imposed a tax that could be paid only with his own monogrammed paper. And he was prepared to enforce it. Now the cards were worth something. Before long, the kids were scurrying around, tidying up their bedrooms, the kitchen and the yard — working to maintain the lifestyle they wanted.
This, broadly speaking, is how our monetary system works. It is true that the dollars in your pocket are, in a physical sense, just pieces of paper. It’s the state’s ability to make and enforce its tax laws that sustains a demand for them, which in turn makes those dollars valuable. It’s also how the British Empire and others before it were able to effectively rule: conquer, erase the legitimacy of a given people’s original currency, impose British currency on the colonized, then watch how the entire local economy begins to revolve around British currency, interests and power. Taxes exist for many reasons, but they exist mainly to give value to a state’s otherwise worthless tokens.
Coming to terms with this was jarring — a Copernican moment. By the time I developed this subject into my first published, peer-reviewed academic paper, I realized that my prior understanding of government finance had been wrong.
In 2020, Congress has been showing us — in practice if not in its rhetoric — exactly how MMT works: It committed trillions of dollars this spring that in the conventional economic sense it did not “have.” It didn’t raise taxes or borrow from China to come up with dollars to support our ailing economy. Instead, lawmakers simply voted to pass spending bills, which effectively ordered up trillions of dollars from the government’s bank, the Federal Reserve. In reality, that’s how all government spending is paid for.
MMT simply describes how our monetary system actually works. Its explanatory power doesn’t depend on ideology or political party. Rather, the theory clarifies what is economically possible and shifts the terrain of policy debates currently hamstrung by nagging questions of so-called pay-fors: Instead of worrying about the number that falls out of the budget box at the end of each fiscal year, MMT asks us to focus on the limits that matter.
At any point in time, every economy faces a sort of speed limit, regulated by the availability of its real productive resources — the state of technology and the quantity and quality of its land, workers, factories, machines and other materials. If any government tries to spend too much into an economy that’s already running at full speed, inflation will accelerate. So there are limits. However, the limits are not in our government’s ability to spend money or to sustain large deficits. What MMT does is distinguish the real limits from wrongheaded, self-imposed constraints.
An understanding of Modern Monetary Theory matters greatly now. It could free policymakers not only to act boldly amid crises but also to invest boldly in times of more stability. It matters because to lift America out of its current economic crisis, Congress does not need to “find the money,” as many say, in order to spend more. It just needs to find the votes and the political will."
"June 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/anderson-pandemic-response-foreshadows-collective-challenge-to-survive-climate-crisis/571202352/,StarTribune,Pandemic response foreshadows our collective challenge to survive climate crisis,"Tucked away on an inside page of the Star Tribune last week was a short story noting that global surface temperatures in May were 1.13 degrees above average, topping the previous record for that month set in 2016. Also noted was that for the 12 months just concluded, global temperatures were 1.3 degrees above average, matching the warmest 12-month period ever, set between October 2015 and 2016.
It’s possible if the coronavirus pandemic had never happened and if George Floyd hadn’t been killed on the streets of Minneapolis, this latest Earth-is-heating-up story would have gained more prominent media display.
That it didn’t doesn’t alter the fact that our climate is changing relatively quickly and that the ramifications will be far-reaching.
Certainly, the nation’s food-growing and livestock-rearing capabilities will be altered, as will wildlife and their habitats and, in fact, entire landscapes. It’s possible, climatologists say, the northern coniferous forest and wetland ecosystem that have long dominated the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness will be replaced by oak savanna.
Yet the discussion today is less about the inevitability of an altered climate than about the sociology and psychology of human attitude change relative to behavior change, and especially the weak correlation between the two — a topic that, given the coronavirus pandemic and the recent tragic death of Floyd and all that has followed, might be the central issue of our time.
Try as they might, sociologists over many decades generally have failed to tie determinatively people’s attitudes to their behavior. Some scientists, in fact, say people’s attitudes don’t consistently determine their behavior at all.
I’ve been intrigued about this topic since 1988, when I spent a year investigating the illegal killing of ducks.
One morning near Culiacán, in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, I watched an American kill about 80 redhead ducks while they were driven over his blind by a young Mexican man in an airboat. When I later asked the American why he shot so many ducks when doing so in the U.S. could land him in jail, he essentially couldn’t explain it, except to say that shooting large numbers of birds was normal and expected in Mexico.
On another morning, also in 1988, the late U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent Dave Hall, along with his colleague, Bill Mellor, and I paddled into a Louisiana coastal marsh about 2 a.m. to hide near a hunting blind the agents knew had been illegally baited with corn.
Just before sunup, the hunters arrived and when the birds started flying, their wariness was lost in their zeal to get the corn. When Hall and Mellor finally revealed themselves to the hunters, showing their badges, the hunters had killed more than 60 ducks, well over their limits.
To his credit, Hall had developed a “Poachers to Preachers” program in conjunction with federal judges in which convicted wildlife killers were required to appear in videos in which they confessed the sins of their ways.
Hall had a video camera with him that morning, and while he interviewed the leader of the violators, he asked me to do the filming.
“This is the third time I’ve busted you for baiting,” Hall said to the violator. “Now you’re out here teaching your kids to poach. What’s it going to take to get you to come into the marsh and shoot a legal limit of ducks, and stop shooting when you do?”
To my surprise, the guy took the question seriously, furrowing his brow and stroking his chin. Then he said, “Raise the limit?”
Infuriating as the man’s answer was, and, yes, in a way, funny, the response was nevertheless fascinating, suggestive as it was of the many ways we all resist behavior change.
Certainly, behaviors in the U.S. tied to cigarette smoking, seat belt wearing and drinking and driving have changed for the better due to persistent messaging.
But in each case, self-interest largely compelled the changes, e.g., if a person stopped smoking, wore a seat belt and didn’t drink and drive, he or she was more likely, on average, to live longer (and in the latter case, stay out of jail) than if the change wasn’t undertaken.
Yet absent such self-interest in the near or intermediate term, people oftentimes don’t change their behavior, regardless of their perceived attitude.
Thus the difficulty, complexity and challenge of fighting global climate change: What, after all, can individuals do to effect positive global climate outcomes in their lifetimes?
The answer too often is “little” or “nothing.”
The same matrix of human choices and their relationships to individual and societal benefits has been front and center during the past four months in the world’s attempt to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic.
Stay home, our leaders say. Keep your distance from others. Wear a mask when appropriate. Adhere to these behaviors, the message goes, and the individual and society at large will benefit in the near and long term.
Generally, but not universally, people have done pretty well. But their motivation (to stay alive) has been extreme, and the perceived benefit, immediate.
Unfortunately, because individual behavior change is far more loosely correlated, if at all, to solving climate change, in this and similar cases only behavior change compelled by legislation, regulation and the perceived negative personal consequences of each has the greatest chance of long-term, positive societal outcomes.
Hall’s “Poachers to Preachers” program changed some poachers’ behaviors through persuasion.
But it wasn’t until Minnesota waterfowlers, among others, bought Fish and Wildlife Service agents a $650,000 float-equipped helicopter to quickly and effectively locate and, when necessary, land on duck poachers, that the miscreants’ behavior changed on a large scale.
Sometimes, it turns out, actions do speak louder than words
Or, as Martin Luther King Jr. said, “Morals cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated.”
Absent such regulations, look for this month to be the hottest June on record, and perhaps July will be, too."
"June 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/whatever-the-official-number-u-s-jobless-rate-is-troubling/571226242/,StarTribune,"Whatever the official number, U.S. jobless rate is troubling","The economic headlines have headed in different, if not opposite, directions in recent days. All are newsworthy, although at least one is not novel: Monday's confirmation from the National Bureau of Economic Research that in February the U.S. entered a recession.
Just hours later, Wall Street's closing bell signaled that the S&P 500, which had risen 44% since its mid-March low, had erased all of its 2020 losses. (Until Thursday, that is, when in reckoning with realism on COVID-19 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's downbeat economic analysis, it fell 5.9%).
The previous rally reflected the different dynamics driving investors, including a surprisingly strong May report that said about 2.5 million jobs had been added since April, dropping the unemployment rate to 13.3% — still the highest since the Great Depression, but not at depression levels.
But to compound the contradictory trends, the report contained a ""misclassification error"" that noted that the jobless rate was strikingly higher for the last two months. In fact, if calculated accurately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) noted, ""the overall unemployment rate would have been 3 percentage points higher than reported,"" or about 16.3% for May and 19.7% for April.
President Donald Trump, reeling in his re-election race, touted the report, leading to speculation that the administration manipulated the figures. That didn't happen. ""You can discount the possibility that Trump got to the BLS,"" Jason Furman, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, said in a tweet. ""Not 98% discount, not 99.9% discount, but 100% discount. BLS has 2,400 career staff of enormous integrity and one political appointee with no scope to change the number.""
Integrity does not mean immunity from mistakes. BLS officials blamed the error on how workers were classified during the pandemic.
Understanding the error matters for many reasons, and resonates beyond Wall Street. Main Street needs to be able to anticipate demand as it struggles to keep businesses viable. And on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, it's imperative that Congress and the White House are aware of the extent of the extraordinary dislocation the quarantines have caused.
Republican senators are reportedly cool on extending benefits beyond July, when most of them expire. The Trump administration seems uncertain, too. Meanwhile, the Democratic-majority in the House has passed the HEROES Act, a $3.5 trillion bill to extend many of the previous pandemic-related aid packages. That includes cash-starved states and municipalities, which may have to lay off scores more workers without aid.
Negotiations are normal in any expenditure, especially one with such a price tag. But it must be remembered that one of the reasons the true unemployment rate isn't yet at Great Depression levels is because the federal government, on a bipartisan basis, acted fast to avoid a complete coronavirus collapse.
""We've never had such a rapid increase"" in joblessness, Gary Burtless, a labor economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told an editorial writer — even before a Thursday report that more than 1.5 million people filed for unemployment last week. Government action ""averted a humanitarian disaster which would have happened if they didn't have a replacement income.""
An economic and health disaster still looms, at least worldwide, as evidenced by two other sobering headlines from Monday. The first comes courtesy of the World Bank: A ""swift and massive shock,"" it reported, has led to the broadest economic collapse in 150 years. And the World Health Organization reported a new daily record of COVID-19 cases on Sunday.
The global contraction will influence America's economy even if there's continued progress on jobs. Fortunately, the U.S. has the ability to blunt the worst of the pain through extensive, albeit expensive, government spending. It should not make the problem worse by pausing its efforts."
"June 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/healthpartners-medica-cut-fees-for-70-000-in-medicare-plans/571216162/,StarTribune,"Minnesota insurers cut fees for 70,000 in Medicare health plans","HealthPartners and Medica are waiving certain fees for more than 70,000 people in Medicare health plans to encourage seniors to seek care despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
The moves respond to signs that many people have been putting doctor visits on hold, possibly due to worries about exposure to the novel coronavirus.
“We recognize that for Medicare members ... there is a question of making sure that they are getting the care that they need in the context of any concerns that they might have about COVID,” said Dr. Patrick Courneya, the chief health plan medical officer at Bloomington-based HealthPartners. “These last few months have led to delays in them getting in for care for things that they really need to be paying attention to.”
HealthPartners is waiving cost-sharing fees for Medicare members when they seek in-network primary care and behavioral health visits between July and December. The change applies to about 45,000 people in the insurer’s Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost and group retiree health plans in Minnesota and neighboring states.
Minnetonka-based Medica is waiving cost-sharing for in-office, in-network appointments from June to September. Savings are available to about 28,000 people in Minnesota enrolled in the insurer’s Medicare Advantage health plans.
“Our goal is to ensure members get the care they need by seeing their primary care and specialist providers as the first level of care,” Greg Bury, a Medica spokesman, said via e-mail to the Star Tribune. He added that “telehealth at home” will continue “as a secondary option.”
COVID-19 has created unexpected costs for health insurers as a significant number of people seek care for the new respiratory illness. But those costs might be more than offset by savings for health insurers due to deferred health care, according to an April report by the actuarial firm Milliman.
Milliman projected a net reduction in medical costs for health care payers of at least $75 billion.
Many delays were driven by government restrictions on elective procedures to conserve hospital resources for pandemic patients. Those restrictions have eased, yet the Commonwealth Fund reported last month that visits to ambulatory practices remained roughly one-third lower than pre-pandemic levels.
“Many patients are ... avoiding visits because they do not want to leave their homes and risk exposure,” researchers wrote.
Minnetonka-based UnitedHealthcare, which is the nation’s largest health insurer, said in May that it would waive certain fees through September for Medicare Advantage enrollees when they visit doctors.
Eagan-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota said it would waive some cost-sharing fees for about 100,000 people in Medicare Advantage plans.
Minneapolis-based UCare waived certain copays, as well, but also discounted premiums for about 100,000 seniors with Medicare Advantage coverage as people use less health care with COVID-19.
At HealthPartners, cost-sharing will be waived for in-person, phone and video primary care and behavioral health visits, including visits for substance abuse when services provided are in-network.
When COVID-19 emerged, many clinics moved to “virtual visits” where doctors and patients communicate through secure digital channels.
The moves reduced exposure risks and also helped conserve scarce supplies of protective equipment. Some clinics have dabbled with drive-through care to reduce exposure risks.
The volume of in-person visits to primary care clinics is starting to recover, said Courneya of HealthPartners.
“By waiving the copays for primary care, we have eliminated that barrier to [patients] coming in,” he said. “And by doing the same thing for mental health, we recognize how stressful this has been.”
At Medica, telehealth visits will continue to be available under the federal emergency declaration, but they will have copays, said Bury, the company spokesman."
"June 12, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mayo-unveils-key-covid-19-antibody-test/571190162/,StarTribune,Mayo Clinic unveils key COVID-19 antibody test,"A test that could help determine whether people gain immunity after a COVID-19 infection was announced Thursday by Mayo Clinic and its corporate partners.
The test is the first in the world that will be broadly commercially available to identify neutralizing antibodies — the proteins produced after COVID-19 that will fight off the coronavirus if it comes back. Existing tests developed amid the pandemic show whether people have produced any antibodies in response to the illness, but not these key proteins.
“This is more reassuring than just ... a positive [antibody test] to show you have been previously exposed to the virus,” said Dr. Stephen Russell, chief executive of Vyriad, the Rochester, Minn., company that created the test and provided it to Mayo via a licensing partnership with a second company, Regeneron. “This test is showing what level of protection you actually have.”
Vyriad and Mayo leaders cautioned that the test can’t yet give “immunity passports,” or suggest that people are no longer at risk after recovering from the illness.
Nobody knows the amount of neutralizing antibodies needed to fight off reinfection, so a test that merely finds them is insufficient to prove immunity, said Elitza Theel, director of Mayo’s infectious diseases serology laboratory.
Research has shown varying antibody levels in patients who have recovered from COVID-19, including as many as 5% with no antibodies.
The test is available to Mayo clinicians and researchers now and to others in late June.
This incremental advance might frustrate those who are hungry for proof of COVID-19 immunity, but it will accelerate research to answer that question, Theel said.
“It’s been kind of the story for antibody testing from Day One. There was a lot of excitement, as there should have been, but at the same time we didn’t really understand the role of antibody testing, and I think there was, to some extent, overexcitement,” she said. “But with the neutralizing antibody test, I would view this as another step, another tool that we can use to better understand our immune response to [the virus].”
Mayo and the University of Minnesota developed some of the first COVID-19 antibody tests, raising hopes that state health officials could identify people who have recovered and declare them safe to return to work and move about in society without fear of infection. That hasn’t come to pass yet, but the prospect remains.
Studies in monkeys have suggested immunity after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Studies of the global SARS pandemic in 2003 showed two to three years of immunity for people who had been infected by the SARS-CoV-1 virus.
Establishing the spread of COVID-19 in Minnesota will be critical given predictions of a second wave of cases.
The Minnesota Department of Health on Thursday reported 453 lab-confirmed cases and 13 deaths, raising the toll of the pandemic to 29,316 cases and 1,249 deaths — including 994 deaths of residents of long-term care or assisted-living facilities.
The state reported on Wednesday 12,071 COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which identify the active presence of the virus in nasal or throat swabs. Diagnostic tests are different from antibody tests that confirm infections after recovery.
While growth in COVID-19 cases has ebbed in June, it’s unclear what happens next, said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner. “We frankly have no idea where it goes from here, whether it stays in this pattern.”
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington offered its first modeling predictions over a second national wave, starting with an uptick in deaths in August and September due to less compliance with social distancing. The institute predicts 2,193 COVID-19 deaths in Minnesota by Oct. 1.
Existing U and Mayo antibody tests are being used in population studies to assess how many people already had COVID-19 — which is a mystery due to the number of people who never have symptoms but carry and spread the virus.
The U amassed results of antibody tests for hospital workers and clinic patients and submitted the data Thursday to a medical journal for publication. It is also studying whether antibodies can be found in saliva rather than blood serum.
The U is developing a neutralizing antibody test but also is researching whether the total number of antibodies in patients is a proxy for the amount of neutralizing antibodies they carry, said Marc Jenkins, director for the U’s Center for Immunology.
“Then that [ordinary] antibody test becomes a lot more useful than it is now,” he said.
Mayo’s national lab has performed more than 100,000 antibody tests, and the U has processed tests as well for clinicians whose patients needed to know their status. Risk patterns with COVID-19 have become clear, with the elderly being at greatest risk of death along with people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, obesity and diseases of the heart, lung, kidney and immune system.
A key biological feature of the COVID-19 virus is a “spike” protein on its surface that helps it bind with receptors and invade human cells.
While other antibodies act as triggers to activate the immune system to fight infection, the neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus on their own and block its ability to infect cells.
Verifying the presence of neutralizing antibodies so far has required working with the coronavirus, which can be studied only in controlled biosafety level 3 labs by researchers in protective suits.
Vyriad created a safer look-alike virus with the SARS-CoV-2 spike, which can then be tested against people’s blood serum to see if neutralizing antibodies emerge. Tests with this virus can occur in less-restrictive level 2 labs, which exist in many hospitals.
“We can do it without the bunny suits,” Russell said.
For starters, Mayo will use the test for neutralizing antibodies to assess people who have recovered from COVID-19 for donating plasma.
Mayo is leading a national trial to see if this convalescent plasma treats severe COVID-19. So far, the study has tallied more than 29,000 donors and 21,000 recipients.
Plasma rich in neutralizing antibodies could be particularly effective, Russell said, but plasma lacking these proteins could have an opposite effect and stimulate the virus.
“You do not want to be giving people low concentrations of antibodies,” he said. “You thereby run a risk of making things worse. So having a test for neutralizing antibodies that can discriminate between low, intermediate and high [levels] is pretty important.”
The neutralizing antibody test also could help in the distribution of vaccines against COVID-19, once they are available. Theel said initial vaccine quantities could be limited, so antibody testing could assess who needs them the most."
"June 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-trends-better-than-covid-19-hot-spots/571241752/,StarTribune,Minnesota trends better than COVID-19 hot spots,"Minnesota is continuing on its recent trajectory of relatively low COVID-19 case counts even as hot spots for the new coronavirus start to emerge across the country.
Health officials warned Saturday, however, that it's too soon to say whether Minnesota will avoid the path of Arizona and other states that have recently reported significant increases in cases.
One key distinction is that other states were quicker than Minnesota to ease social restrictions that help control the spread of COVID-19, said Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease at the Minnesota Department of Health. So, those states might just be quicker to see the consequences.
""We have had a lot change in our community mitigation measures,"" Ehresmann said, pointing to moves on June 1 and Wednesday that let some Minnesota businesses resume at partial capacity. ""So, we still have a ways to go to be evaluating the impact.""
Nine more people have died of COVID-19 in Minnesota, health officials reported Saturday, as the statewide tally of confirmed cases pushed beyond 30,000.
COVID-19 has caused a total of 1,283 deaths across the state, according to data posted Saturday morning by the Minnesota Department of Health. Residents of long-term care accounted for four of the nine newly announced deaths.
The net count for positive test results grew by 377 confirmed cases on a one-day volume of 12,784 completed tests.
Arizona was noteworthy last week not only for seeing more cases, health experts say, but also because a high proportion of tests were coming back positive. The positivity rate in Arizona was 27% compared with just 3.9% in Minnesota, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University.
""If the positivity is too high, it tells me a state is not casting a wide enough net in order to find infections,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. ""That makes me call into question the case counts themselves, but it could also foreshadow future cases.""
Rising case counts in Oregon prompted the state on Thursday to announce a one-week pause in reopening activities. Hot spots also emerged in Texas, Georgia and Alabama, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
Benjamin said he's been paying close attention to Arizona because the state has a large population of retirees 65 and older who are at higher risk for serious illness with COVID-19.
""They were pretty loose in their initial stay-at-home activity,"" Benjamin said. ""And then they opened up pretty quickly.""
In Minnesota, Saturday's numbers continued a string of days with relatively low counts for new cases and deaths.
Last week, 113 people in the state died of COVID-19, which was the smallest weekly tally since April. The average on Saturday for new cases over the previous seven days was 382 — the state's lowest reading by that measure in more than a month.
The trends are improving, Ehresmann said, but she still urged caution.
""I don't ever want to not be grateful for a day where we have low case numbers and low deaths — everybody should be happy for every day that happens,"" Ehresmann said. ""It's just that when it is good, we cannot extrapolate that it's going to be like that forever. I think we have to recognize that this is a very fluid situation.""
COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus that surfaced in China late last year.
Most patients with COVID-19 don't need to be hospitalized, since the illness usually causes mild or moderate sickness.
Saturday's report showed 390 people require hospitalization including 191 people in intensive care. At times in late May, slightly more than 600 Minnesotans were hospitalized with COVID-19 and as many as 263 patients required intensive care.
People at greatest risk from COVID-19 include those 65 and older, residents of long-term care facilities, and those with underlying medical conditions. The medical conditions range from lung disease, serious heart conditions and cancer to severe obesity, diabetes and kidney patients who need dialysis.
On Wednesday, the state launched the latest in a series of changes to reduce restrictions designed to slow the spread of COVID-19. Indoor restaurants, swimming pools, movie theaters and fitness clubs started to operate at limited capacity.
Officials with the University of Minnesota last week announced plans for a near-normal reopening in the fall that includes classrooms, dormitories and common spaces under restrictions for social distancing. As universities across the country consider plans for reopening, they're confronting difficult questions related to the cost of routine testing, said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
""If you say that you're going to test 5,000 people daily at a test that costs $50 — and these are just an example — that becomes extraordinarily expensive,"" Mina said during a Friday call with reporters.
Testing could help prevent outbreaks, he said, but there's also a role for widespread use of even simple masks. Mina cited mask-wearing in densely populated Hong Kong as a likely reason for few outbreaks there.
""Mask wearing ... can be a game-changer,"" he said, ""if we as a society collectively decide that we will adhere to those rules."""
"June 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/banks-increasing-reserves-amid-covid-downturn/571160182/,StarTribune,Minnesota banks increasing reserves amid COVID downturn,"The unemployment rate and the level of the stock market get the most attention.
But a better way to see how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting the economy is by looking at how much money banks are setting aside, or putting on reserve, to cover losses of the businesses and people to whom they loaned money.
In their role as lenders of first resort, bankers have front-row seats to the economy as it unfolds. They see both the demand for money and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans.
And in April, when their first-quarter results came out, they revealed they were putting aside three to four times as much money as they normally did for bad loans, credit card defaults and other troubles.
For U.S. Bancorp, the Minneapolis company that runs the nation’s fifth-largest bank and has a sizable presence statewide, that meant a $993 million provision, with $600 million tied to future loss expectations. That was more than twice what U.S. Bank usually puts aside in a quarter for bad loans, credit card defaults and other problems.
Wells Fargo, which is larger than U.S. Bank but vies with it for the most assets and branches in Minnesota, built its loss reserves by $3.1 billion in the first three months of the year. And TCF Financial, the state’s No. 3 bank, put aside $96.9 million, including $74.1 million for COVID-19 effects.
In recent weeks, investors and analysts have speculated that most banks will raise the amount they set aside, or put in reserve, in the second quarter. During a virtual conference with analysts last week, U.S. Bank executives said they will add more to the bank’s reserves because economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, are worse than they expected three months ago.
“The reserve build in the second quarter will be higher than the reserve build in the first quarter and it’s primarily driven by how economic outlooks have changed since late March,” Terry Dolan, the company’s chief financial officer, said.
Like the rest of the U.S. economy, banks were thriving until February, when the need to fight the virus forced people to work and learn from home and brought on the first recession since 2008. But they were also in the midst of a slow but steady consolidation, driven chiefly by the need to spread out high costs of building digital services.
That force helped drive TCF into a “merger of equals” with Michigan-based Chemical Financial Corp., a deal that closed in August and resulted in the company’s headquarters being based in Detroit. And it also triggered a tug-of-war between the trustees and management of Minnesota’s largest privately held bank, Bremer Financial Corp., that remains unresolved.
The wave of deals before the pandemic also led the Minneapolis-based investment bank Piper Jaffray last year to acquire New York-based Sandler O’Neill, a boutique investment bank that specializes in advising financial mergers."
"June 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/special-session-kicks-off-with-a-divide-over-minn-police-reforms/571225152/,StarTribune,"Minnesota Democrats and Republicans split on police reforms, governor's state of emergency","Minnesota legislators clashed sharply on Friday as top Republicans rejected much of a sweeping DFL package of police reforms brought in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.
The opening hours of a special session put their contrasting agendas on full display, with Senate Republicans pushing instead to end the state of emergency that allowed Gov. Tim Walz to close bars, restaurants and schools to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
As expected, Walz formally extended those emergency powers Friday for another 30 days, triggering the special session that brought lawmakers back to the State Capitol.
The GOP-led Senate immediately voted to end Walz’s peacetime emergency, calling for more legislative oversight over the pandemic. But the DFL-controlled House blocked the move, assuring that the governor’s emergency powers can run into July. The House and Senate also disagree on how long the special session should last: Senate Republicans vowed to gavel out again and return to their districts in one week, while House Democrats accused them of trying to “cut and run on Minnesotans” by rushing important debates on police accountability.
“To say we’re going to come in, we’re going to charge ahead, we’re going to get these things done without having listened to the community because we’re in some big hurry because we’re in a special session, that isn’t the approach to take,” said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park. “The approach to take is to truly listen and to take the time it needs. Minnesotans pay us all year round. It may not be convenient to come to work in June, but the work is in front of us.”
Democrats also argued that it is inconsistent for Republicans to adjourn while also pressing for more legislative oversight over the governor’s actions.
“If we are going to end the emergency order, then we’ve got to do the work,” said Sen. Matt Little, DFL-Lakeville.
But Republicans made clear that their top priority is restoring a state economy devastated by the extended closures mandated under Walz’s peacetime emergency powers to battle COVID-19.
“That’s the problem with emergency powers; he gets to decide who wins and who loses,” said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake. “There’s a whole lot of people in Minnesota who are on the losing side who are very frustrated.”
Gazelka suggested that lawmakers could continue to work on race and police issues even after the special session ends. Another move by Walz to extend the state of emergency would trigger yet another special session in July.
“Minnesota has the opportunity to lead the way for the whole nation for reconciliation of the races and some of the problems we’re addressing,” Gazelka said. “Let’s begin here.”
Even as Minnesota and other states seek to respond to the outcry over Floyd’s death, Congress is working on its own set of police reforms, including a package by Senate Republicans aimed at winning the approval of President Donald Trump, a political ally of Minneapolis Police Federation President Lt. Bob Kroll.
There were some signs of agreement in St. Paul on Friday. The House and Senate struck a deal on a $62 million package of grants for small businesses impacted by the pandemic. The funding would be equally divided between businesses in the metro area and greater Minnesota. Both sides also say they want to pass a more than $1 billion public works bonding bill that failed during the regular session that ended in May. Some state borrowing could help businesses in St. Paul and Minneapolis damaged by days of riots and looting in response to Floyd’s death.
The pandemic became the focus of lawmakers’ work during the regular legislative session, but Floyd’s death hung heaviest over the Capitol on Friday. Members, spaced out for social distancing on the House floor, opened the session by pausing for 8 minutes and 46 seconds — the length of time former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd’s neck before Floyd took his last breath.
Outside on the Capitol steps, civil rights activists pushing for police reform demanded action from legislators before they adjourn.
“We need legislators on both sides of the aisle to step up to the plate. The world is watching what is happening here in Minnesota,” said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. “The sad reality is if legislators had taken the voices of communities of color seriously with regard to the crisis in policing, we wouldn’t be in this place that we’re in right now.”
House Democrats have scheduled a hearing Saturday to review a police reform package largely developed by members of the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus and a task force led by state Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington and Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is prosecuting Chauvin and three other officers implicated in Floyd’s death.
The DFL package, laid out by Walz on Thursday, would reform use-of-force standards, increase oversight of police discipline and encourage community-based alternatives to traditional law enforcement. They also include proposals to ban police chokeholds and “warrior style” police training, while giving the state’s attorney general authority over all deadly force cases involving police officers.
On Friday, Senate Republicans signaled support for some of those measures, including less controversial moves like banning chokeholds, which are already limited by most Minnesota police departments. But they voiced opposition to many other DFL proposals, including putting the attorney general in charge of prosecuting officer-involved killings.
One GOP-backed initiative would abolish or limit mediation rights for police officers fired for wrongdoing. But that measure faces opposition from some DFL-leaning public employee unions.
“I really want the many police officers throughout the state to know that we appreciate the effort that you do day in and day out,” Gazelka said. “There always must be a few bad apples that must be plucked out, and that’s what we’re trying to do here.”"

As Minnesotans return to restaurants, gyms and theaters following months of coronavirus closures, some candidates are resuming in-person efforts to court voters.
Minnesota-based staff for the Trump Victory effort have tweeted about knocking on doors as part of the campaign’s summer launch. “The shutdown is ending and now we talk with real people in person,” one woman tweeted, along with a selfie featuring a mask, clipboard and bottle of hand sanitizer.
Mary Giuliani Stephens, a former Woodbury mayor challenging Senate DFL Leader Susan Kent in a suburban district, sent an e-mail to supporters seeking door-knocking volunteers of her own. “Efforts will use precautions such as stepping back from doors and wearing masks with older voters,” the e-mail read.
And Tyler Kistner, a Republican running against U.S. Rep. Angie Craig in a suburban swing district, has been meeting voters at farmers markets and small gatherings. On Wednesday, he spoke at a Rice County Republican meeting. Photos posted to Twitter show no one wearing masks in the open-doored barn.
“I think voters are looking to see more engagement at this point,” said Billy Grant, a GOP strategist advising Kistner’s campaign. “In all cases, we’re taking precautions, still following social distancing. People were glad to see him and glad to see him talking about the issues.”
Not everyone is rushing back to the physical campaign trail. DFL Party Chairman Ken Martin said Democrats are “going to continue to follow advice of public health officials and campaign virtually.” He criticized Republicans for “doing everything they can to fly in the face of facts and science” and disregarding public health.
“We’ve been very clear about our guidance and directives, which is to really limit in-person campaigning where possible,” he said. “I think a vast majority of Minnesotans still support these socially distancing measures and are still worried about COVID. And we have to respect where the electorate is.”
Outside the campaign trail, the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody and the unrest that followed have also prompted more in-person appearances from politicians on both sides of the aisle. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jason Lewis, who also campaigned during the stay-at-home order, visited damaged businesses, alongside GOP congressional candidate Lacy Johnson. A number of state legislative and congressional Democrats have also made site visits in recent weeks.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis, has been one of the most visible members of the congressional delegation in the wake of Floyd’s death, attending protests, listening sessions and community service events in the district. Her campaign has partnered with nonprofits for donation drives, turning its headquarters into a “distribution center to provide food and other essentials for members of our community.”
“My goal right now,” she said. “Is to support the community we represent in a critical time.”"

The coronavirus won't be loosening its grip on the United States anytime soon, infectious disease experts said Sunday. They are also uncertain how the viral spread will be affected by the patchwork of states reopening businesses and by large events like protests and President Donald Trump's upcoming campaign rallies. ""This virus is not going to rest"" until it infects about 60 to 70% of the population, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said on Fox. Joseph Fair, a virologist and epidemiologist who recently recovered from a serious bout of COVID-19, echoed that view on NBC. ""Once it gets so ingrained in the population, there's not a point where we can come back from that other than having a vaccine in place,"" said Fair, who is a medical contributor to NBC News.
Iran
Tehran: Highest daily death toll in 2 months
Iran suffered its biggest daily death toll from the coronavirus since April 13, when the country first started to relax lockdown measures and reopen its economy, state TV reported. So far, a total of 187,427 people have been infected with the disease and 8,837 have died, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said in a televised statement, adding that 107 deaths had been recorded in the past 24 hours, the highest number in nine weeks.
China
Government fears second wave of virus
Fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections struck China's capital city as a new cluster was discovered over the weekend, centered around a massive seafood, meat and produce market in the southern Fengtai district of Beijing. Beijing's health authorities reported six confirmed cases Saturday and 36 new cases Sunday, with an additional eight cases reported late Sunday. All were locally transmitted infections, breaking a monthslong trend of China reporting mostly imported COVID-19 cases while the domestic transmission seemed to be largely under control.
Washington, D.C.
How accurate are the virus tests being used?
Months into the outbreak, no one really knows how well many of the screening tests work, and experts at top medical centers say it is time to do the studies to find out. When the new virus began spreading, the Food and Drug Administration used its emergency powers to OK scores of quickly devised tests, based mainly on a small number of lab studies showing they could successfully detect the virus. That's very different from the large patient studies that can take weeks or months, which experts say are needed to provide a true sense of testing accuracy.

Putin chides U.S. for 'political' virus response
President Vladimir Putin said Russia is emerging ""confidently"" from the coronavirus crisis, drawing a contrast with the United States, where he suggested Donald Trump's efforts to tackle the pandemic have been hamstrung by political bickering. In an interview with state TV, Putin said Russia has suffered ""minimal losses"" from the virus and praised the government for working in a coordinated fashion ""as a single team."" Protests sweeping the U.S. are a sign of ""deep internal crises,"" he said. Putin said it would be hard to imagine a situation in Russia where regional governors ignored his instructions. In the U.S., some states have defied guidance from the White House in dealing with the deadly virus."

Yet its healthy cash reserves had executives talking on a recent earnings call about buying up bargain-priced companies during the global coronavirus pandemic.
In contrast, clothier Christopher & Banks closed all of its retail outlets and laid off employees early in the pandemic — with sales plunging 50% in February, April and May — and now relies on a forgivable government loan to help it survive.
More than six months into the COVID-19 crisis, it is apparent that the virus hasn’t affected all populations — or businesses — the same. Disparities exist from region to region based on preparedness and efforts to stem the spread of the virus.
While corporate filings and earnings calls show the pandemic has hurt the vast majority of Minnesota’s public companies, some have fared better than others. Factors such as existing cash reserves and credit lines played a role in easing sales erosion, year-over-year profit losses and slumping earnings per share.
But happenstance, such as market sector, also was a factor. Companies generally responded quickly to pandemic-forced disruptions in the economy, but the costs of COVID-19 have not spread equally.
Within individual companies certain product categories or segments have fared better than others depending on the end markets served.
For the most part, Minnesota companies moved quickly in March to address the most immediate concerns regarding the virus and its economic effects.
“As a longtime Minnesotan, I’ve spent my entire business career here, I’m really proud of the way our companies really stepped up.” said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at the Minneapolis office of Abbot Downing, which is part of Wells Fargo’s wealth management business. “They didn’t sit around and wait for a week or two or a month or two. They had all of their teams deployed really quickly.”
Schleif saw a trio of things that she has not seen happen before: More than 200 of the S&P 500 have pulled guidance; companies cut dividends and suspended share-buyback programs; and companies moved quickly to improve their liquidity by drawing down their revolving lines or credit, rework loan covenants or issue new debt.
Adjusting to COVID-19 conditions also meant companies moved as many employees as practical to work-from-home solutions, investing in technology when needed. They also eliminated unnecessary travel and flexed up on the use of videoconferencing technologies.
Companies also instituted furloughs or temporary wage cuts or deferrals of merit-pay increases. Some companies hoped to build goodwill when they made layoffs by helping employees understand new state and federal unemployment benefits.
Companies such as Ecolab and General Mills mobilized quickly to get their cleaning and sanitation products out to businesses and packaged foods to a sudden surge of home cooks. Best Buy and Target moved quickly to lean more heavily on their e-commerce and remote pickup options.
Even smaller companies such as Minneapolis-based Hawkins mobilized quickly by ramping up production of bottled bleach to meet demand in food and health end markets, it said in its earnings release on May 20. It also saw decreased demand from ethanol producers and resorts, besides its traditional customers.
Patrick Hawkins, the company’s president and CEO, said the company was able to adjust its manufacturing mix to meet demands, and as a result, it kept its approximately 650 employees working throughout.
Andy Adams, chief investment officer at St. Paul-based investment firm Mairs & Power, noted that some of Minnesota’s local manufacturing companies have benefited from earlier investments that have helped mitigate their COVID-19 costs.
“In touring most of the manufacturing facilities of our Minnesota-based companies over the years, I believe they are in a good position to restart operations with minimal changes to how they operate,” Adams said. “Companies like Toro, Graco and Donaldson have invested significantly in automation over the years, which has had the benefit of creating natural social distance in their facilities.”
While some companies — especially those with operations in China — had early visibility into the economic effects of the coronavirus spread, most started to feel the direct effects in last half of March. Thus, public financial statements are just now beginning to record the effects.
Those with overseas operations like Donaldson said they already are starting to see recovery, especially in China and other Asian markets.
Both consumer behaviors and supply-chain effects were hard to predict as well.
“Honestly, I think we’ve handled [the pandemic] about as well as anyone has,” said Scott Wine, chief executive of Medina-based Polaris.
Supply-chain risk was one of the outdoor vehicle company’s big concerns as it tracked and tried to minimize disruptions from China, to California, New York, Italy, India and most recently Mexico.
The company’s production was deemed essential, but Polaris took a voluntary week to 10-day shutdown of manufacturing operations to make changes to production lines and processes to meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and other safer operating procedures for employees.
Wine said the biggest impact to Polaris came from the closure of dealers because of stay-at-home orders.
The company quickly rolled out a Click.Deliver.Ride tool as a way for people to buy off-road vehicles, motorcycles and snowmobiles through participating dealers and get home delivery.
“That’s been very, very helpful in serving our customers, but that is just an example of how our team has pivoted when needed to provide customer solutions,” Wine said.
Consumers also helped. In April and May, new customers turned to Polaris’ side-by-side and four-seat vehicles for family-friendly outdoor recreation. The online-sales program helped deliver those purchases, and Wine said the option will continue as part of a broader mobile service option the company had in development.
Although Polaris has not yet disclosed the total cost, company officials said earlier this year that changes cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Austin, Minn.-based Hormel reported $20 million in COVID-19 costs in the second quarter and said it would need to spend $60 million to $80 million more in the second half of the year.
“They’ll get some efficiency leverage with time but initially there was no time to negotiate for PPE, and safety measures had to be implemented quickly,” said Michelle Warren, an equity analyst with Mairs & Power
The latest predictions from analysts and executives is that recovery from the pandemic’s financial devastation likely will be measured in years.
“When you say … emerge, clearly you have to take out the next few quarters, just based on the uncertainty that we talked about, and really the industry is talking about. From our perspective, we’re thinking two-plus years out,” said Hormel CEO Jim Snee in a June 2 earnings call.
Still, the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t just increased costs and hurt earnings, it has also presented opportunities and accelerated business trends.
“Any economic trends that were in place the COVID crisis probably accelerated by three to five to seven years,” said Abbot Downing’s Schleif. “So any industries that were having trouble are now finding themselves in a deeper hole, and trends like e-commerce, in-home delivery and work from home suddenly accelerated.”
Yet because companies pulled guidance with the economy’s uncertainty for the rest of the year, there is a chance to try some innovation that would not have been possible if there were strict financial goals to meet.
Even as Medtronic predicted slightly worse earnings in the first quarter of 2021 because of the COVID-19 effects, CEO Geoff Martha on an earnings call was addressing chances for mergers and acquisitions.
“I think it is a good time to do M&A,” Martha told stock analysts. “Asset prices are down. It doesn’t mean that we lower our standards. I just think, again, we can play offense.”
Medtronic, the world’s largest medical device maker, has $10.9 billion in cash and investments and a $3.5 billion bank credit line that it has yet to tap, Martha said. The company owes no public debt on earlier borrowing until March 2021. It believes it normal growth will replace losses beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
The leeway isn’t unlimited, though.
“This [pandemic] absolutely gives companies the ability to reset expectations in the short term,” said Adams of Mairs & Powers. “I think investors have given management teams a free pass on Q1 and Q2 earnings results. However, if the number of new cases stays stable or improves from here, I think investors will expect a pretty strong bounce-back in margins over the remainder of the year and certainly in 2021.”"
"June 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/we-can-stop-a-second-wave-of-covid-19-we-have-the-technology/571265282/,StarTribune,We can stop a second wave of COVID-19. We have the technology.,"The technology already exists to detect most new cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States. And it’s not even that expensive. While the country was locked down, scientists developed a number of fast, easy test kits that could flag infections in homes, offices or medical centers. Others have devised wearable devices that can monitor the subtle changes in heartbeat that occur before people show symptoms.
Holding all this back are fears about privacy, inappropriate regulation and a defeatist attitude about testing and contact tracing. Americans seem wedded to the belief that an overwhelming number of cases are caught by passing strangers on the sidewalk or in the supermarket, despite growing evidence they come primarily from close contacts, which can be traced, or crowds, which can be avoided.
The recent kerfuffle over a WHO statement on “asymptomatic” carriers highlights the level of emotion driving the discussion. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO director of infectious diseases, first said that cases in which totally asymptomatic people transmit the disease are rare. She later amended that, saying such asymptomatic cases are not well understood.
That’s true, but in the end, her valid message was lost, which was that there’s evidence that the primary driver of the disease appears to be people who do get sick; that they can spread the disease before they get sick; and that fatalities can be prevented by finding people with symptoms, tracking down their recent contacts, and isolating those who test positive.
Strategic combinations of routine testing and contact tracing have helped many countries — from Iceland to Germany to South Korea — avoid the heavy death tolls suffered in the U.S.
Meanwhile, the U.S. has plodded along with increased testing capacity but little strategy. This week, the Boston Globe reported that there were three times as many tests as test takers in Massachusetts, since cases are down and tests are still widely believed to be reserved for only people with serious illness.
What we really need now is surveillance — an ugly word to American ears, but in the public health context it should be thought of as spying on the virus, not on people.
While some surveillance can be done with excess existing tests, we would do even better to deploy faster, cheaper, easier tests. MIT professor and biotech founder Lee Gehrke and colleague Irene Bosch have developed one of those testing technologies — a so-called antigen test, which can pick up an active infection using a test strip, like a pregnancy test.
These researchers developed similar tests to scope out Zika and dengue infections. In contrast to the standard COVID-19 test — known as PCR — antigen tests can be read with no special equipment or expensive materials.
One reason these aren’t yet widely deployed is that regulators at the FDA are too focused on testing accuracy when they should be focused on how the tests are used and whether they are accurate enough to do more good than harm in specific contexts.
The FDA was too lenient with antibody tests, which are designed to detect past infections and held out as a hope for “immunity passports.” The benefit was marginal, and a high rate of false positives could lead to harm if many people wrongly assume they are immune.
Antigen tests, on the other hand, can save lives by detecting active infections. Experts say these tests tend to have a low rate of sensitivity — they catch only about 80% of infections. A report in Science says antigen tests find true positives between 50% and 90% of the time. But that’s still useful if they’re used for randomly sampling people to locate possible outbreaks. And Gehrke points out that if people are tested repeatedly over several days, a test with 80% sensitivity will catch almost everyone.
Right now, catching 80% of infections among an asymptomatic population is better than what we’re doing now, which is catching zero.
Bettina Fries, the head of the infectious disease division at Stony Brook University, says that testing and surveillance are critical for keeping the economy running without risking new spikes of disease. For this to work, routine testing has to be relatively easy. People aren’t going to wait hours in line every day at a drive-through facility to endure repeated, deep nasal probes.
Gerhke says antigen tests can be geared to work with different kinds of samples, including saliva or nasal swabs that sample from a more accessible depth. Results take at most 15 minutes, with high viral loads showing up almost instantaneously.
Another simple, practical solution is the adoption of wearable devices that flag infection early. Scientists already know that our heart rates change when we get the flu. This change can be seen on a wearable device days before we come down with symptoms. Researchers working on that technology at Stanford, UCSF and Scripps Research Institute quickly turned their attention to COVID-19, and they say such devices could pick up infections days before people show symptoms — or in people who report no symptoms.
At Stanford University, one of these researchers is Michael Snyder, who has been developing an algorithm for detecting heart rate changes and other physiological signs associated with COVID-19. He says before the pandemic, his own wearable picked up four infections — one case of Lyme disease, confirmed by a test, two viral infections and one asymptomatic infection he said he can confirm because his blood also showed a high level of C reactive protein — a marker of a recent viral infection.
Now he’s gathered data on several thousand people during the pandemic, including 14 who eventually tested positive for COVID-19. In 11 of the 14, the devices picked up a strong signal of infection before the person got tested, and in 9, it found infections before there were any noticeable symptoms. He says he expects the technology to catch all of the infections early, and is confident that with more tweaking, accuracy will improve.
Physician Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Translational Research Institute, is heading part of another study of wearables. He’s also been tracking different countries’ success in fighting the virus, and deems the U.S. the world’s worst performer so far. And yet, American scientists have been busy inventing smart ways to get out of the mess.
The purpose of the lockdowns was to buy time for hospitals and researchers, and to allow public health officials a chance to devise a more targeted strategy. The doctors and scientists have done their part; we have the technology to control the disease. Now we need an organized commitment to use it."
"June 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/make-it-easier-to-vote-in-america/571276422/,StarTribune,Make it easier to vote in America,"Georgia’s primary election last week was hardly an exemplar of democratic efficiency. Equipment malfunctioned, backup ballots went missing, lines stretched interminably and many voters waited for hours to cast a ballot — sometimes in vain.
One reason for the chaos? Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of poll workers didn’t turn up. That should serve as a warning for November’s presidential election: All states need to offer no-excuse mail voting this year, and Congress should help them do it.
Even before the coronavirus, the share of votes cast by mail had been increasing in recent years, reaching about one-quarter in 2018. The practice has long been helpful for those who can’t get to a polling place due to disability, work or other concerns. It may also have broader advantages. In Colorado, which instituted all-mail voting in 2013, researchers found that turnout has increased and that voters of color have benefited in particular.
Although mail voting isn’t without risks, these shouldn’t be overblown. Misconduct is one reasonable concern. Yet research suggests it’s extremely rare: Over the past two decades, with some 250 million votes cast by mail nationally, there have been only 143 confirmed cases of fraud. Nor does increased vote-by-mail appear to favor one political party over the other.
Moreover, with 2 million U.S. coronavirus infections and counting, the case for voting remotely is especially strong in 2020. While no one can predict how the pandemic will look by November, it’s reasonable to expect that many voters — especially older ones — will still want to isolate themselves and that state officials will still be discouraging large crowds. That makes mail-in voting desirable purely on public-health grounds.
Ideally, then, states should be sending ballots to all registered voters well ahead of Election Day. Yet obstacles remain. Several states still require a valid reason for voters to mail in ballots and haven’t made accommodations specific to the coronavirus.
That should change. Even areas that have made good-faith efforts this year have run into trouble. While Georgia tried to ensure that all registered voters could easily get absentee forms, for instance, many never received their ballots. A similar foul-up marred the primary in Washington, D.C."
"June 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/covid-test-distributed-by-minnesota-firm-premier-biotech-gets-ok-to-be-sold/571253832/,StarTribune,Minnesota firm gets emergency OK to sell Chinese-made COVID-19 test,"An embattled COVID-19 test that senses the presence of the virus by detecting antibodies to it has been found to be accurate enough that its Minnesota distributor can sell it, just as other tests are being removed from the market.
Premier Biotech, a Minneapolis drug-testing firm that has pivoted to distributing a Chinese-made test for detecting COVID-19 antibodies, plans to ramp up sales in coming weeks. The Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency-use authorization (EUA) for the test on June 4, and on Thursday posted the results of an independent performance assessment by the National Cancer Institute.
“For me, having the results published was a big deal, so the rest of the country could know what we knew from the beginning, which is that this is a good test,” Premier Biotech CEO Todd Bailey said Sunday.
Other tests are being taken off the market. One, made by BioMedomics and sold by major medical technology firm BD, was removed in early May after the FDA updated the rules on performance characteristics needed to get EUA.
A second-generation test is in the works. Tests made by Phamatech and Tianjin Beroni Biotechnology Co. were also voluntarily withdrawn.
Researchers and medical labs generally use two overarching kinds of tests for COVID-19 — serology tests and molecular tests.
Serology tests like the one distributed by Premier Biotech react to the presence of specific antibodies that a person’s immune system makes to fight off the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Antibody tests on the market today including Premier’s cannot be used to diagnose a specific case of COVID-19. But they can be used in “seroprevalence” studies on overall rates in well-defined populations.
Scientists are still trying to refine their knowledge about how much time needs to pass before people have detectable numbers of antibodies.
One early study of antibody testing, not yet peer-reviewed, looked at 173 patients with COVID-19 in China and found the rates of correct detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies was at its highest at 16 days after symptom onset.
Last week, Mayo Clinic announced availability for a new antibody test produced by Rochester-based Vyriad to look for the presence of neutralizing antibodies.
Molecular tests, on the other hand, are the gold-standard method of diagnosing an active COVID-19 infection. Often called PCR tests, these tests detect the presence of viral genetic material in swabs taken deep from the throat or nose.
Their accuracy peaks around eight days after exposure, a study-of-studies in the Annals of Internal Medicine shows.
The Minnesota Department of Health says diagnostic testing has been used to confirm 30,471 cases of COVID-19 in residents since early March, including 311 cases added to the tally Sunday.
Of those, about 26,100 people have passed a 14-day self-monitoring period and no longer need to self-isolate.
In Minnesota, 1,298 people have died from COVID-19, including 1,030 residents of long-term care and assisted living.
The vast majority of fatalities happened in people 50 or older. Underlying health conditions increase the risks, including chronic lung disease, uncontrolled severe asthma, serious heart conditions, immunocompromise, obesity with BMI greater than 40, diabetes, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, and liver disease.
Both the rate of new deaths and the rate of newly confirmed cases has been slowing in Minnesota for two weeks despite increased PCR testing and large-scale civil rights demonstrations over the death of George Floyd.
Nationally, the United States has recorded more than 115,000 deaths among more than 2 million confirmed cases.
The number of new cases is rising in states including California, Arizona, Texas, Florida and Georgia, with some of the rise due to increased testing. Case counts are declining in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Massachusetts, according to the New York Times’ closely watched case tracker.
Early in the pandemic, the FDA responded to the sudden and overwhelming demand for COVID-19 tests in the U.S. by lowering the bar to entry for many.
PCR tests started to be sold with only minimal prior validation by their manufacturers, while more than 100 antibody tests flooded the market with no direct oversight by the FDA.
As a result, many tests suddenly became available with scant evidence supporting their quality.
The Associated Press reported Sunday that even now, months into the pandemic, “no one really knows how well many of the screening tests work.”
The U.S. House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy entered the fray in April, demanding to know why the FDA allowed unproven tests to go to market and why some tests’ claims of accuracy on packaging were not reproduced in independent testing. The subcommittee claimed credit for forcing the FDA to require antibody test makers to submit data and get emergency use authorization.
One of the tests singled out for extra scrutiny was the one sold by Premier Biotech.
A letter from the subcommittee to the company CEO alleged that academic researchers in California had found far lower rates of accuracy for the test in an unpublished study than what was advertised on the product label.
The subcommittee’s letter said the test correctly identified the presence of a specific antibody called IgG only 53% of the time in 129 validation tests. An April 28 letter from the subcommittee said the test’s sensitivity was “deeply troubling.”
But last Thursday the FDA publicly posted the results of federally funded performance assessments done at the Frederick National Laboratory in Maryland that found the Premier Biotech test correctly identified the IgG antibody 93% of the time in 30 samples. A second antibody, IgM, was positively identified in all 30 tests. The test didn’t return positive results for any of the 160 negative samples used on it.
Virtually all of the tests on the FDA’s web page for validated antibody tests today have positive-detection values between 90 and 100%.
Bailey said Sunday that the independent review, which used specimen-handling methods described on the product label, agreed with the validation results Premier had seen from other organizations.
“We were extremely excited, but not surprised,” Bailey said. “We knew the test was performing well. But having the [federal laboratory] do the study themselves as a federal study, that is the best part.”
Like many antibody tests, the Premier Biotech test is only validated today for use in certified labs for high- and medium-complexity work. The company is working on research to show it can also be accurate at the point-of-care using blood drawn from a finger stick, but that work is ongoing."
"June 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/would-we-be-better-off-with-a-president-pence-in-these-turbulent-times/571292872/,StarTribune,Would we be better off with a President Pence in these turbulent times?,"It’s a question no one is asking, so I guess it falls to me.
In January 2020 it was almost as if God, the universe or our Lizard People overlords were giving the Republicans one last chance to separate their fate from President Donald Trump’s. The Higher Power couldn’t actually tell the GOP, “If you don’t choose wisely, you’ll be stuck with him during a time of trials, tribulations and even a plague.” But it’s not like they weren’t warned that the president would one day be tested beyond his abilities. Prophets don’t predict, they warn. And such warnings have been thick in the air for a very long time.
But few Republicans heeded, and a complaisance just shy of Stockholm syndrome finally set in. After all, the economy was humming, the normal rules of politics had not applied to this president for so long, and the base was so invested in Trump, best to keep your head down. Sodom and Gomorrah were fun towns while they lasted too.
Like a TV drama that needs to foreshadow the plot twists of the next season, the plague actually started as a subplot of the impeachment drama. Tom Cotton left the Senate trial at one point to lobby the White House to take the strange illness plaguing the Chinese city of Wuhan seriously. It all seems so foreordained in hindsight. Isn’t that always the way?
Of course, one might argue that the president shouldn’t have been removed from office because he wasn’t guilty. But few Republicans, outside the president and his coterie, actually took this position. Most hid behind the claim that the prosecution hadn’t made its case, even as the Senate moved to block the prosecution from fully making its case. A handful of senators, led by Lamar Alexander, conceded that Trump did abuse his power by pressuring Ukraine to muddy up Joe Biden, but that his missteps weren’t worth impeaching him over. As Marco Rubio put it, “Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a president from office.”
Fair enough. But here we are. And that raises the question: Would we be better off today without President Trump? Those who claimed, quite angrily, that impeachment would have overturned an election always ignored the fact that the 12th Amendment prevents that. Removal would have delivered a President Pence, not a President Hillary Clinton.
It’s self-evident that Pence would have handled the pandemic better. His stewardship of the White House coronavirus task force was marked by quiet, assured and reassuring, professionalism. If he hawked hydroxychloroquine or bleach as potential miracle cures, I missed it.
It is true, of course, that whenever given the opportunity to put distance between himself and the president, Pence never does. It feels to me, though, that this is because he is in hostage mode, stoically reciting into the camera whatever his captor has demanded he say. I always look for signs that he is trying to blink the Morse code for “TORTURE” into the cameras, but so far I haven’t seen it.
With Pence as president, it’s unlikely the White House would have launched the Battle of Lafayette Park, nor would Pence have floated conspiracy theories about Joe Scarborough being a murderer or a 75-year-old Buffalo, N.Y., man being an antifa provocateur. More broadly, the policies that Trump enablers claim are the benefits that come with the transactional costs of tolerating — or even celebrating — the self-destructive drama of his presidency would disappear.
While the country would be in better shape, it’s hard to know if the GOP would be, at least in the short term. On one hand, post-impeachment Pence surely would have gotten the rally-around-the-leader bump that Trump frittered away (and that nearly all state governors are still enjoying).
On the other hand, Trump’s rage-tweeting from his Mar-a-Lago Elba certainly would have created problems for the Republican senators who voted to convict. But the contrast between the staid President Pence and his predecessor might actually help Pence attract the Republican-friendly voters Trump has scared away.
More important, the same “binary choice” logic constantly used to justify support for Trump would apply. Do you want to give the Democrats total control of government or do you want to hold your nose and vote for the lesser evil?
Obviously, it’s all spilled milk now. But it’s a useful mental exercise nonetheless. Because if the suggestion that we would be better off had the Republicans removed Trump from office enrages you — beyond your pet theories of the impeachment case against him — it might indicate your support of Trump is less transactional than you like to claim."
"June 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/target-to-raise-its-minimum-wage-to-15-permanently-in-july/571313882/,StarTribune,Target to raise its minimum wage to $15 permanently in July,"Target will permanently raise its starting wage to $15 an hour next month and offer one-time bonuses of $200 to its front-line store and distribution-center workers who have helped the retailer stay open throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
With the permanent pay bump, benefit increases and safety investments such as personal protective equipment — plus a $1 million donation to the Target Team Member Giving Fund — the Minneapolis-based retailer said it is spending $1 billion more in pay and benefits than it did last year.
Target had already temporarily raised its $13 minimum wage by $2 in March, a pay bump that has been extended twice in recent months as team members worked to fulfill orders and keep stores stocked during the coronavirus crisis.
The permanent change is making good on a goal Target leadership announced in 2017 to gradually increase its starting pay to $15 an hour, a payout that affects about 275,000 of its employees at stores and distribution centers across the country.
Beginning this week, Target is also offering free virtual doctor visits through the end of the year to all employees regardless of whether they purchase insurance through the retailer, it said Wednesday.
In addition, Target is extending other COVID-19-related benefits including free backup care for children or other family members through the end of August and a 30-day paid leave for team members who are 65 or older, pregnant or those with underlying medical conditions.
“In the best of times, our team brings incredible energy and empathy to our work, and in harder times they bring those qualities plus extraordinary resilience and agility to keep Target on the forefront of meeting the changing needs of our guests and our business year after year,” said Brian Cornell, chief executive of Target Corp., in a statement Wednesday.
“Everything we aspire to do and be as a company builds on the central role our team members play in our strategy, their dedication to our purpose and the connection they create with our guests and communities.”
The pay increase will go into effect July 5. All U.S. hourly full-time and part-time team members at stores, distribution centers and the Minneapolis headquarters will be eligible for the pay bump.
The one-time $200 bonus will be given at the end of July to eligible full-time and part-time hourly employees at stores and distribution centers. Bonuses of $250 to $1,500 were paid out in April to around 20,000 department heads.
In 2017, Minneapolis became the first Midwestern city to adopt a $15 per hour minimum wage, which will be phased in over several years. St. Paul passed a $15 per hour minimum-wage requirement in 2018.
The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, which hasn’t been updated since 2009. Over recent years there has been a push nationally to raise the federal minimum wage as some cities and states have started to increase minimum wages on their own."
"June 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-gop-decries-secretary-of-state-deal-on-absentee-ballots/571321102/,StarTribune,Minnesota Republicans decry secretary of state deal on pandemic ballots,"Republican lawmakers sharply rebuked legal agreements Wednesday between DFL Secretary of State Steve Simon and two citizens groups that would ease absentee ballot rules during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The agreements, first announced Tuesday, allow voters to submit their mail-in or absentee ballots in the Aug. 11 primary without witness signatures. Election officials also will count ballots that arrive within two days of the primary, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.
Ramsey County District Judge Sara Grewing signed off Wednesday on a consent decree to move forward with the changes in a lawsuit brought by one of the groups, the Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans Educational Fund. An agreement reached in a separate case brought by the League of Women Voters is pending in federal court.
Republican lawmakers said both deals circumvent the legislative process and bend a state election law negotiated by the Legislature during the regular session earlier this year.
“Preparations are already well underway for the primary,” said Rep. Tony Albright, R-Prior Lake. “What is that going to cause, in terms of chaos and costs, if all of a sudden by his own hand he has acquiesced to these two groups and thrown uncertainty into the mix?”
The agreements with Simon stem from lawsuits the groups filed against the state in May. They were part of a wave of cases brought in several states seeking to address concerns about voter safety during the coronavirus pandemic.
Early absentee and in-person voting for the August primaries begins June 26. With just nine days to inform people about the changes, Simon said his office will post information on its website and work with local government officials to get out the word.
“It’s too late to reprint the ballot forms,” Simon said, adding that his office can instruct counties and cities to add inserts with ballots notifying the public of the changes.
Simon has been a leading proponent of voting by mail. He had pushed the Legislature this year to expand mail-in voting for the August primaries and the November general election but faced resistance from GOP lawmakers citing concerns about fraud.
Despite the GOP objections to the mail-in ballot changes, Simon said it’s not usual for consent decrees to change election laws. He added that a judge had to sign off on the agreement and find it in the public’s best interest.
While the state judge approved the deal in the case brought by the Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans, the federal case brought by the League of Women Voters has a hearing scheduled Thursday. One remaining question is what happens if a federal judge issues a different decision.
“We’ll leave that discussion for court,” said John Stiles, a spokesman for state Attorney General Keith Ellison, who represents Simon’s office.
An agreement has not been reached in a third lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP. That case also aimed to suspend the witness requirements but goes a step further by requesting that Simon send absentee ballots to all registered voters, a measure that Simon had sought in the Legislature. ACLU-MN attorney David McKinney said his group will continue to push in court for both of those changes for the November election.
Gary Severson, a board member of the Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans, said the agreement to temporarily waive witness requirements is “good news for thousands of Minnesota voters.” Severson, 72, is immunocompromised because of diabetes and doesn’t want to vote in person. While his wife can act as his witness, he said others are concerned about meeting the state’s witness requirement to vote by mail.
Minnesota generally requires that witnesses be other registered voters or notaries public. Minnesota is one of 12 states that require a witness, Simon said.
“There [are] too many that that would be a burden for,” Severson said. “It’s a lot more common than anybody realizes.”
Severson also said post offices will be swamped with absentee ballots this year, and the extension will help alleviate that. The next step for his organization is to push for the same changes to the November general election as well, he said.
Sen. Mary Kiffmeyer, R-Big Lake, said the organizations suing Simon are his “liberal friends” and that election officials should follow the laws that are in place. She said the GOP-led state Senate is reviewing its options for intervening in the situation.
The Minnesota Republican Party also condemned the action.
“There is a reason a witness signature is required when voting by absentee ballot — to prevent fraud,” GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan said in a statement, calling it “unconscionable” for Simon to go around the Legislature and agree to the changes."

Cecere, a 24-year-old teacher from Minneapolis, said she wishes she could go out with her friends, but she’s concerned that gathering indoors or in large groups may not be safe. She’s only meeting friends outdoors for takeout at 6-foot intervals, though she knows many friends are going to barbecues and beaches and clinking their glasses at rooftop bars.
“It’s so concerning,” Cecere said. “It’s not a lesser threat than it was two months ago.”
It’s not just a perception that young adults are more lax about pandemic precautions. The data indicate that young people have a sense of invincibility.
A web-based survey of 2,221 U.S. adults in mid-May found the lowest levels of pandemic hygiene among people between 18 and 25, according to a report in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publication. The survey included about 545 people from New York and Los Angeles and 1,676 from the rest of the United States.
Those 25 or younger reported the lowest rates of wearing masks in public, avoiding groups of more than 10, and staying 6 feet apart in any adult group. Forty-three percent said they would have felt comfortable if all pandemic restrictions had been lifted when the May 5-12 survey was conducted.
“That age group is at that sweet spot of being pretty autonomous … but also at low risk of personal bad outcomes” from COVID-19, said Stephen Kissler, a postdoctoral researcher in epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “My fear is that people who assess their own risk as low could be putting their communities at risk.”
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this week publicly scolded young adults, saying they are putting the rest of the public at risk by not social distancing and hand-washing. The comments generated pushback on social media.
An Instagram post from a Dinkytown bar revealed a lot of interest in partying and few coronavirus-related concerns. “Liquor time,” a comment said. “How tempting,” said another. “Watch everyone get the virus in a week,” one person commented with a laughing emoji.
On Wednesday, families and other small groups were on the beach at Bde Maka Ska Park. Twenty-year-old Niko of Minneapolis sat with three friends, none of whom wore a mask. He said he has been hanging out with friends throughout the pandemic.
“[It was] definitely a smaller group of friends when it all started, but I would say the last three weeks I started hanging out with everyone again,” Niko said.
“I have no worry of myself getting it,” he said. “I don’t hang out with anyone who has it or thinks they may have it. … I never really come into contact with elderly people either.”
Niko, who declined to give his last name, wears a mask only when required. “We have to wear masks and everything at work, and that’s the only time I see people who aren’t 20,” he said.
People in their 20s account for 19% of the lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Minnesota, second only to people in their 30s. Young adults are less likely than people in other age groups to have chronic health conditions like kidney and lung disease, which increase the risk of serious cases.
The statistical modeling used by Minnesota to project future case counts assumes that young adults are much less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 than other groups that get infected, based on peer-reviewed data from other states. Though young adults’ risk of going on a mechanical ventilator once in the hospital is on par with other age groups, their risk of death from COVID-19 in the hospital is much lower — 5% to 10% for young adults, vs. 78% for people aged 80 or older, if a breathing machine is used, the modeling data show.
In Minnesota, only two of the 1,325 people who have died of COVID-19 have been in their 20s.
“When it comes to a lot of the guidance that we put forth for teens and young adults, it’s easy for them to think … it really doesn’t apply to them, because there is a perception of being invincible,” said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director for the state Department of Health. “But that doesn’t mean they don’t have a role to play in making sure that as a community, we are safe and protected.”
Dr. Renée Crichlow, a University of Minnesota family and community health physician, noted that national data from the CDC show that at least 125 people between 15 and 24 have died since the outbreak began across the U.S. Lower rates of wearing masks and social distancing will lead to a longer, more widespread outbreak, since the virus can be spread by asymptomatic people. “If you want everything open again, slow the spread by doing your part to protect other people,” Crichlow said in an e-mail.
Nick Stumo-Langer, 27, a recent graduate of the U’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, said some official statistics showing lower rates of hospitalization and death among the young likely contribute to the long lines of young adults outside bars on weekends.
“A lot of it comes from this perception that people my age are immune to COVID and the dangers around it,” he said. “I definitely think it’s chalked up to that messaging that, if you don’t have underlying health conditions and are under 50, then you’re fine.”
Stumo-Langer said he wonders whether young adults consider how their night out could end up spreading COVID-19 to older family members. “I would feel awful if something were to happen, and it could be traced back to me wanting to go have a cheap gin and tonic,” he said.
Kissler noted that most transmissions happen in household settings, so young adults should talk to their roommates before heading into risky situations.
“This outbreak has — and should — really make us more mindful of the people with whom we are living,” he said."
"June 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/long-awaited-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-arrives-in-minnesota/571332162/,StarTribune,Long-awaited COVID-19 antiviral drug remdesivir arrives in Minnesota,"Minnesota state health officials received a long-awaited shipment of an experimental antiviral drug used to treat COVID-19 patients Tuesday that could benefit 180 to 325 patients.
The drug, remdesivir, which is donated by the manufacturer and distributed by federal and state governments, is still in short supply even though it was approved for emergency use May 1.
For the past three weeks, Minnesota has been allocated only enough vials to treat 80 to 140 patients, depending on dosages needed. In two of those weeks, no states received any shipments, and the federal government has said there will be none next week.
“We are not giving remdesivir to everybody that we want to give it to, and that creates a difficult and painful situation,” said Dr. Frank Rhame, a virologist at Allina Health. “It is in excruciating high demand.”
The drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc. said it’s working to meet the global demand for the drug, which can cut recovery times by 30%; it expects to produce enough to treat 1 million people this year.
The Minnesota Department of Health said it distributed most of what it received this week to hospitals.
Since the shipments began in early May, Minnesota has received 7,800 vials or about 1% of the doses distributed nationwide. The allocation is based on patient hospitalizations, and states that have seen a rise in patients, such as Arizona, got a larger allotment this week.
Although most people who are infected with the new coronavirus recover without needing medical attention, people with underlying health conditions are most likely to need to be hospitalized.
Of about 2,400 Minnesota patients, 79% had at least one existing medical problem, such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity, according to the Health Department.
The number of people needing hospital care in Minnesota has been steadily decreasing throughout June, with 181 people in intensive care beds and 170 in general hospital beds as of Wednesday.
“The trends reversed last week,” said Soumya Sen, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management who tracks hospitalization trends.
“The more people in intensive care the more the need for the drug,” he said.
The drug has been shown to cut recovery times from 15 to 11 days. While most clinicians acknowledge that the improvement is not a huge benefit, it would be important if there were a hospital surge because it could free up beds faster.
“We would be able to treat more patients and save more lives,” Sen said.
Since the drug was first distributed, about 690 people have needed intensive care, he noted. The supplies Minnesota has received were enough to treat 700 to 1,300 patients, although patients who are not in intensive care do receive the drug in some cases.
Since delivery of the medication has been spotty, hospitals have been forced to ration the drug to those who could benefit the most using an ethical framework developed by the Health Department.
“You pick the people who are earlier in the disease,” Rhame said. “Some of them are not in the ICU.”
To avoid any favoritism toward certain patients, each hospital is asked to set up a triage team that will make decisions about who gets the drug separate from the treating physician.
“We go through our patient lists every day that we’ve got the drug in supply,” Rhame said. “And then the next couple days you don’t have any left and you can’t give it to anybody.”
Dr. Sarah Lim at the Health Department said she is concerned about what will happen when the drug distribution program ends in two weeks.
“I would say we are more concerned about whether the supply from [the federal government] will stop after this last expected shipment and whether there will be a gap in availability,” she said. “I have reached out to Gilead but they were unable to provide any answers.”
The drug is expected to be available commercially if it receives approval from the Food and Drug Administration and would no longer be considered experimental.
With 31,296 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,325 deaths in Minnesota, state health officials Wednesday reported 419 new cases and 12 deaths, including 10 in long-term care facilities.
But the new case counts were inflated because of a lag in reporting test results to the state by a private laboratory. Officially, the number of tests processed Tuesday was more than 19,500, a one-day increase of more than 13,000 tests.
However, state health officials clarified that the tests could have been run anytime from Saturday to Monday.
About 27,400 who were known to have been infected have since recovered and no longer need to be isolated."
"June 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/l-a-el-salvador-are-mirror-images-of-poverty/571354272/,StarTribune,"L.A., El Salvador are mirror images of poverty","As the signposts we call civilization decrease in frequency, cars accelerate.
Speeds rise as storefronts and suits taper off — at the point where the asphalt begins to crack.
From her perch on 6th Street, one of the invisible watches the cars pass by homes that, like hers, were assembled from found objects. Shorty’s floor is nothing more than a slip of fabric over concrete; her roof, a patchwork of tarps, wooden boards and discarded umbrellas. There is no electricity here, no plumbing. She relieves herself in a pot, and throws her waste into the gutter.
After spending the last nine months in El Salvador, and the last several weeks traveling to impoverished areas to deliver aid in the coronavirus era, I was familiar with this kind of landscape.
Only I was no longer in a remote, hilltop village of the rural developing world. I was in Skid Row in the center of downtown Los Angeles — one of the richest cities in the richest country in the world. Three thousand miles from the mountains of El Salvador, people like Shorty persist through strikingly similar conditions — a phenomenon that has reached new depths amid a global pandemic.
“Look at this trash,” said Shorty, one of nearly 60,000 people experiencing homelessness in LA. “This is a lot of filth. People can’t wash their hands.
“This may not be the community that I desire, but it’s a community. We’re still people.”
A week and a half earlier, I had been in El Salvador, hiking into the highland villages surrounding a town called Santiago Nonualco with a local group of organizers.
The highway, en route to the rural department of La Paz, boasts signs reminding drivers to stay home to halt the spread of coronavirus.
But in the country’s agrarian hills, like most repressed corners of the world, the roads change — from paved interstates to rocky thruways to narrow dirt paths connecting homes constructed from bamboo, mud and metal slats. Tamarind trees burst through the thick, tropical jungle, their branches reaching up like flares.
On one Saturday afternoon, Guadelupe Vasquez, flanked by her son and grandson, flipped thick corn tortillas on the comal outside their tin-roofed adobe home.
Though the lack of TVs — through which to pipe the city’s pulse-racing reports — made the virus feel far away, its impact arrived faster to a community that was already living hand-to-mouth and enduring severe water shortages. At the time there were no known cases of COVID-19 in this area, but the government’s draconian response served to cut off access to vital activities such as working the fields, selling wares and traveling into town to buy food.
Like other funds earmarked for the very poor, the promised $300-per-family stipend wasn’t reaching these villages, the populations that needed the help the most. Mandates were made without people like the Vasquezes in mind because without the markers of “civilization” — bank accounts, addresses, salaried jobs, basic utilities — the state doesn’t even know they exist.
Right now, said Coruvera, Vasquez’s son, “we’re eating just one time a day.”
Days later, after leaving El Salvador via an evacuation flight, I was driving into Skid Row, where I have now been reporting for two months. As tents and boarded windows emerged, 6th St. changed — manicured planters replaced by overflowing garbage cans.
The virus can feel far away here, too — masks are rarely worn; social distancing is nonexistent. But in Skid Row, also, the impact arrived early. Many food sources, such as fast food restaurants and organized drives, evaporated. Relied-upon facilities reduced hours or closed altogether. As in El Salvador, where residents in communities long cut off from water sources turn to rivers and distant public taps, those in Skid Row are similarly deprived, sharing woefully few community wash stations, and often resorting to prying open a fire hydrant.
Those who find themselves “off the grid” — that is, devoid of the government services we all rely on — are virtually incapable of receiving the life-changing CARES Act check that is rightfully theirs. I worked with Shorty to fill out the applicable government forms yet, week after week, the mailbox she uses at a nearby organization remains empty.
This failure is nothing new: In the last four years, California has earmarked over $2.7 billion for the homeless community — about 11% of Minnesota’s entire budget for 2020 — yet the population continues to grow. Even if laws are made with people like Shorty in mind, they have failed to reach her, and current coronavirus-inspired efforts largely ignore the fact that the need in communities like these is everlasting.
“COVID?” an activist and Skid Row resident who calls himself CruShow scoffed. “We’ve had tuberculosis, we’ve had Staph, every disease you can think of.
“We’re in a pandemic here 24/7.”
When we consider the world’s most glaring poverty, we often think of a place like El Salvador; of bare feet and stripped-down structures and the smell of open sewers.
But this is not a distant problem in some far-off developing country. It’s a plague that germinates in our own backyards, in the center of our lauded cities; a pandemic that we somehow cruise through and forget.
In Skid Row, on an Saturday, King Pharoah, an R&B artist and Skid Row resident, was setting up a burner to cook for his neighbors. He’s one of the many who sees government funds regularly fail to find their way here, and has worked to organize grassroots solutions in their place.
He looked down San Pedro St., one of the roughly 50 square blocks that compose Skid Row, at the succession of tents erected between accumulating trash. Here, “civility” has largely given up; stopped caring, stopped seeing the faces that dwell in the places where the asphalt cracks.
“It’s apathy,” Pharoah said. “People pass by and stop seeing people as humans.”
As cars emerged on the horizon, they accelerated.
“And the community still lives like this.”"

Here's a closer look at the science,"Nearly 160 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development. Although all approaches are distinct, they are based on a few simple strategies. Here’s a closer look at how they work.
Traditional approaches
Some researchers are attempting to use the entire SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to induce a broad immune response, knowing that minor viral infections can inoculate patients against more serious disease. An advantage of these methods is their proven efficacy. They have helped defeat polio, hepatitis A, rabies and other diseases. But working with a live virus is risky, these vaccines are challenging to create, and production is time-consuming.
Live attenuated virus vaccine
Developed in 1937 by virologist Max Theiler to create a yellow fever vaccine, this protocol takes a live virus and introduces it to mice, chicken embryos or other nonhuman species. As the virus becomes more successful at replicating in nonhuman cells, it loses its ability to replicate in human cells. When introduced back into the human body, attenuated viruses still trigger an attack by the immune system. Such vaccines provide protection against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox and one type of rotavirus.
Inactivated virus vaccine
This protocol, pioneered by Jonas Salk in the early 1950s, takes live viruses and kills them so they can’t replicate. The inactivated, or dead, virus is injected into the body, which prompts the creation of antibodies. Inactivated virus vaccines often require periodic booster shots. This protocol was used to create Salk’s injectable polio vaccine, and the hepatitis A and rabies vaccines.
Newer approaches
Many researchers are hoping that a single protein on the coronavirus’ surface can do the job. Disable the so-called spike protein, or S protein, the theory goes, and the virus can’t access the host cell. But some researchers worry that if the S protein mutates, the vaccine will be ineffective.
Viral vector vaccine
Researchers splice genetic instructions for making the S protein into a harmless virus, which is then injected into the body. The virus uses human cells to mass-produce the protein, and the immune system attacks the virus and the protein with antibodies. Sometimes the harmless virus has been modified so that it cannot replicate inside the body. Non-replicating viruses might require higher doses or booster shots. Researchers used this approach to develop an Ebola vaccine.
Virus-like particle vaccine
Researchers are trying to develop a “particle” that resembles the coronavirus but without the deadly genetic machinery. Once introduced into the body, this harmless particle should appear foreign enough for the immune system to attack. The human papillomavirus vaccine takes this approach.
Protein-subunit vaccine
Researchers hope that by injecting synthetically produced S protein into the body with no genetic material attached, they can induce an immune response that would prime the body to attack the coronavirus. If this defense isn’t entirely successful, it could still prevent developing serious complications like pneumonia. Some influenza vaccines work this way.
RNA- and DNA-based vaccines
Researchers have sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome and are using it to synthesize its RNA. Like many viruses, coronaviruses have RNA instead of DNA, and some scientists use the RNA to create the corresponding DNA. Once the genetic material is injected into the body — without a virus to carry it — it is taken up by cells that begin producing the S protein, triggering an immune response. There is some concern that the vaccine’s DNA could subvert the cell’s normal function. But DNA has the advantage of being more stable than RNA."
"June 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/america-s-exceptional-failure-dealing-with-coronavirus-is-indisputable/571377912/,StarTribune,America's exceptional failure dealing with coronavirus is indisputable,"The COVID-19 crisis has handed the countries of the world a simultaneous challenge, akin to a high-stakes reality TV show.
Here’s a new virus; even at a relatively “low” fatality rate of 1%, its unchecked spread will kill millions. The challenge: Bring transmission to a halt, or at least to a level such that life can resume with some evidence-based precautions.
Well, episode one of this reality show is over, and it’s pretty clear we’re a favorite to be booted from the island, kicked out of the house, whatever is done to remove the weakest link.
The countries of the world have all taken their best shot at the challenge, and many have pulled it off, even those that had some early stumbles.
Take Italy: Its northern region was hit hard. Physicians read accounts of what was going on in Italian hospitals and shuddered — this was an advanced country with a robust health care system, how could this happen? Deaths spiked — 969 on March 27, per the New York Times coronavirus tracking site (the source for all the numbers presented here).
But Italy rallied. Lessons were learned. People masked, stayed home and pulled together. New cases peaked in late March at over 6,000 a day, but since then the curve has bent steadily downward, such that by June 17 they were down to 328 daily cases.
Other European countries had less of a catastrophe at the beginning, and have had even better results. Germany peaked at just 315 daily deaths in mid-April; its curve of new cases has also been steadily downward to just 580 cases on June 17.
Austria, geographically between Italy and Germany, fared more like its northern neighbor: As of June 17 deaths are down to zero, new cases are at 14.
A quick scan around the globe shows the same encouraging trend — the graph of new cases moving steadily downward, with the absolute number of new cases (all on June 17) being reassuringly low: New Zealand (the envy of all of us) with zero. Denmark with 44. France with 458. South Korea with 59.
Against that record, how have we stacked up? Dismally. Whereas the graph of new cases for all the previously mentioned countries is a steady downward trend, we are at a plateau, with no discernible movement toward zero. Our deaths peaked at 2,752 on April 15, but as of June 17 over 700 Americans are dying daily.
The count of new U.S. cases is astounding: While other countries are in the hundreds, our new case count is at 25,610. Remember, Germany is at 580. We’re about four times as large a country, so we could feel OK with 2,000.
We’re at 12 times that.
It’s time to acknowledge the obvious: many countries have risen to the challenge of bringing transmission down to a manageable level. The United States, with the world’s largest economy, the most advanced medical care (purportedly), and our ethos of American Exceptionalism, has not met the challenge.
What are the countries whose company we are now in? Brazil, 32,188 new cases. Russia, 7,843 new cases. Iran, 2,612 new cases. Is this the best we can do? Is this when we choose to start having political rallies, open up bars and make wearing a mask some sort of political statement? Evidently, yes.
This is not something we can explain away: Everyone had the same task. Everyone had the same scientific studies to read and learn from. Everyone had the same tools. Some countries met the challenge. We have not.
Perhaps we still can, but with sporadic masking, contradictory advice from state and federal governments, and a president who is actively contradicting advice from public health authorities, our chances are slipping."
"June 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/return-to-work-waivers-for-covid-19-liability-are-questionable-here/571379832/,StarTribune,Return-to-work waivers for COVID-19 liability are questionable here,"A trend is developing that demands that employees sign waivers of liability, in favor of their employers, in the event they contract COVID-19 upon their return to work as the restrictions are lifted.
While few of them have surfaced in Minnesota, they are spreading like a virus across the country. In a handful of states, laws have been enacted or gubernatorial executive edicts issued immunizing employers from liability claims by coronavirus-infected workers, including Alabama, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah.
Meanwhile, legislation is pending in Congress, promoted by Republicans in the Senate, to require immunity for large sectors of the workplace, in exchange for joining Democratic-sponsored legislation in the House of Representatives, extending additional stimuli payments.
Waiver supporters insist that such immunization is necessary in order to reinvigorate the economy, while opponents caution against them for fear that they will expose employees to illnesses for which they cannot receive compensation.
Other observers point out that the insistence on those waivers may give out the wrong signal, particularly to customers and vendors, that measures are not being taken to safeguard the places they patronize.
Looming limitations
Setting aside the efficacy of those arrangements, the looming limitations of liability are of questionable legal validity.
At first blush, the waivers seem legally suspect because they are presented as unilateral take-it-or-leave-it arrangements that employees may view as coercive and are signed under duress. However, the courts generally uphold these kinds of devices, as long as employees have a choice, which they do, to either accept an employer's imposed terms or not work.
The Minnesota courts have long upheld prospective disclaimers of liability for incidents of negligence, but not gross impropriety or intentional wrongdoing by the propagator of the instrument and not for what are deemed ""essential services,"" which generally do not extend to employment relationships. The state Legislature stepped into the fray in 2013, enacting a law that imposes limitations on disclaimers for consumers. The measure basically leaves the existing judicially crafted law intact, permitting disclaimers as long as they do not grant immunity to employers for actions beyond mere negligence or ordinary carelessness. The statute, however, only applies to consumers and not to others who may have engaged in relationships, such as employees, subcontractors, vendors, and the like.
Even if they are facially valid, the compelled waivers may not be legally enforceable. The rarely invoked legal doctrine of ""public policy"" could void them. Under that tenet, an arrangement, even if mutually agreed upon between parties, may be invalid if it is contrary to what is known as ""well established public policy."" In the case of back-to-work waivers, it could be argued, and possibly determined, that the devices are inimical to the public interest and, therefore, not enforceable.
Further, the arrangements may run afoul of the Minnesota workers' compensation laws. Similar to most states, the Minnesota measure provides that employers are liable, without regard to fault, for any injuries or afflictions incurred at work. The amounts, however, are quite meager. Although Minnesota at one time was one of the most hospitable states for workers' compensation benefits, for the last two decades, statutes have converted it to one of stingiest.
Proof problems
But liability is not automatic; proving that a virus was contracted at a workplace may be difficult. While the workers' compensation law surmounts that problem by imposing liability on an employer regardless of fault, there must be sufficient proof that the workplace was the cause of the affliction.
In exchange for the indulgence in imposing liability without regard to fault, the workers' compensation law deprives employees, in most instances, of their ability to sue employers for damages unless they can show that the employer acted in a way that constitutes ""gross negligence,"" meaning beyond the ordinary type of carelessness, or intentional misconduct.
The workplace waivers also may be ineffectual for other reasons. Employees who contract the virus at work and can prove the relationship to the workplace may be barred from suing, or relegated to workers' compensation benefits. However, their family members or others who pick up the disease from them would not be subject to the waiver, and therefore could sue, subject to significant evidentiary problems proving the link to the workplace through the workers there.
The workplace immunity also would not limit possible claims by others who contract the disease, such as subcontractors, customers, vendors or others who are on the work premises but not employed there.
For these reasons, work waivers are of dubious enforceability and effectiveness. Far from these legal infirmities, they provide a signal to the community, particularly prospective customers, that the workplace is not safe.
Given these problems, both legal and pragmatic, employers may choose to refrain from requiring employees to waive their rights as a condition to return to work. They may figure, on balance, that the problems associated with the waiver trump the advantages of using them.

The owner of Northern Wilderness Outfitters in Fort Frances, Ontario, across the Rainy River from International Falls, Davis employs two Twin Otter floatplanes each summer to fly Minnesota anglers and others to 16 lake cabins he owns in northwest Ontario.
An American with permanent Canadian residency, Davis spent $400,000 this spring preparing for a summer fishing season that has yet to begin because U.S. anglers can’t get into Canada because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The news Wednesday, Davis said, that the border between the two countries will remain closed at least until July 21 arrived like a punch in the gut.
“It’s one thing to lose your job,” he said. “It’s another to lose your job and your business at the same time.”
While some Minnesota resorts have benefited from the border closure, motels and other tourist-related businesses in International Falls and other border towns have been devastated.
“Our retail businesses, the ones that are open, are down about 30 percent this summer,” said Tricia Heibel, president of the International Falls Area Chamber of Commerce.
Motels in town that typically are full, particularly on summer weekends, sit nearly empty. And long lines at grocery stores and gas stations where anglers and other vacationers stock up before crossing into Ontario have evaporated.
“Our government thinks the virus is a lot worse in the U.S. than it is in Canada and if they open the border, Americans will come up here and infect everyone. ”
Eric Brown, Canadian resort owner
As many as 3,000 vehicles ply the bridge connecting International Falls and Fort Frances on typical summer days. Now fewer than 50 do.
“Not only are we missing the tourists, but about 50 percent of our businesses is from Canadians who cross the border to shop because most everything is cheaper here,” said Tim Shuff, who with his son, Aaron, owns Sportsmen’s Service, an International Falls sporting goods store founded in 1936.
Minnesotans who booked fishing outings in the far north this summer are frustrated, too.
Mike Schuett of Emily, Minn., had planned next week to take his grandson, Zack Springborn, to a remote Ontario outpost cabin to celebrate Zack’s recent graduation from Irondale High School.
A friend of Schuett’s, Mark Harrington, and his son, Matt, a Hill-Murray graduate this year, were eagerly anticipating the floatplane fishing adventure as well.
Schuett and Harrington had placed deposits on the trip months ago. Now the payments have been rolled over for a trip next summer.
“It’s disappointing,” Schuett said. “But there’s nothing we can do about it.”
Laurie Marcil, executive director of Nature and Outdoor Tourism Ontario in North Bay, Ontario, said some Canadian resorts and fishing camps might go under.
“We’re all getting sick and tired of being sick and tired,” said Marcil, whose association comprises about 300 member resorts and outfitters. “Our surveys suggest about 60 percent of our members are in dire financial straits.”
Canadian tourism operators are pleading for government help, Marcil said, in the form of tax credits or cash infusions. Especially problematic are the last-minute notices by the two governments that the border will remain closed. Scheduled to reopen May 21 and then June 21, the two governments announced only days ahead of those deadlines the border would be shuttered another month.
“Resorts can’t plan for staffing and supplies in that short of time,” Marcil said. “They still had full camps of Americans planning to come if they had been allowed to open [beginning Sunday], and they had to organize accordingly. Now, again, the border won’t open.”
Totem Lodge on the Canadian side of Lake of the Woods is the largest such freshwater operation in North America, with 350 beds, 100 boats and motors and more than 200 employees. The lodge and its sister camps serve 6,000 guests each summer, the vast majority Americans.
“Our [Canadian] government is just killing us,” owner Eric Brown said, adding he had considered applying for a $2 million government loan to cover his costs this year but couldn’t afford the payments.
“Our government thinks the virus is a lot worse in the U.S. than it is in Canada and if they open the border, Americans will come up here and infect everyone,” Brown said. “But we’re already open for Canadian guests and we have all the safety protocols in place. Additionally, the government could start testing at the border, that’s what we’ve advocated, and we could do it at the resort, too, if necessary. It could all be done.”
With tens of thousands of lakes and the largest concentration of hunting and fishing camps in Canada, the region of Ontario just north of Minnesota is especially vulnerable to the border-closing downturn.
Minnesotans also feel particularly targeted, generations of whom consider Canadian fishing trips a rite of summer.
“Not only are we missing the tourists, but about 50 percent of our businesses is from Canadians who cross the border to shop because most everything is cheaper here.”
Tim Schiff, International Falls store owner
John Naimian, owner of Oak Lake Lodge, an Ontario fly-in operation on the English River system, said all but 1% of his clients are Americans, and most are Minnesotans.
Naimian’s employees drive each summer from northern Quebec, half a continent away, and he plans to pay them through July 21, even though he has had “zero income.”
“If the border doesn’t open in another month, I will have to decide whether to keep my employees until September, like I usually do, with no income for me and no tip money for them, which is a big part of their pay,” he said.
“I’ve lost a lot of sleep over it. Finally, I decided I’ll live with it however it turns out.”"

Open Cities’ network of nonprofit health clinics serves some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the Twin Cities in the middle of a pandemic, in the middle of an economic collapse, in the middle of neighborhoods that were on fire a few weeks ago. They do it on shoestring budgets, with 15-year-old computers and scavenged personal protective equipment.
“Thank you.” Nearly everyone in line takes the time to say thank you to Ng and the other volunteers sweltering in the June heat under stifling layers of protective gear. “Thank you. Thank you so much.”
Months ago, when they first started testing, a third or more of the people who came to Open Cities with symptoms tested positive for coronavirus. Now the state is recommending that anyone who’s been to a vigil, mass gathering or crowded event during the George Floyd protests should get tested as a precaution.
Most of the people in line will be fine. Just 1% of the first 1,300 protesters tested positive.
That doesn’t change the need for masks and gear to protect the people swabbing all those throats and noses.
Every hospital, clinic and doctor’s office in the country faced shortages as America’s medical supply chain buckled under pandemic demand.
Months into the crisis, each piece of personal protective equipment that comes to Open Cities is a small victory.
Doctors and nurses here have haunted local hardware stores, trying to coax away a few extra dust masks or painter coveralls.
The mask Ng wore came from her cousins in Macau, who scoured local pharmacies for Chinese-made masks and shipped them in bulk care packages to St. Paul.
Open Cities medical director Dr. Cynthia Woods wore a face shield made by the Chippewa Middle School robotics club in North Oaks. The students made PPE on 3-D printers in the school lab and donated 100 of them to Open Cities.
Masks gets reused. Gowns get sprayed down with bleach or alcohol and hung up to dry for another day.
There’s a stash of actual N95 masks at the clinic, locked away like treasure. They’re saving them for the dental clinic when it reopens from its coronavirus hiatus.
The pandemic forced the clinic to scale back its services, lay off staff and turn to telemedicine. Few services will be riskier than dentistry, which puts dentists, technicians and patients face-to-face in an aerosolized cloud kicked up by the drill.
If they ration the N95 masks just for the dental clinic, Open Cities will need about 2,300 of them to make it through December. At last count, they had 101.
“It’s kind of ridiculous we’re still scrounging” for basic medical necessities months into the pandemic, Ng said.
But 101 of the good masks are better than none, and Open Cities is used to making the best from less.
The clinic opened in a church basement in 1967 with a volunteer staff determined to offer health care and health education to the Rondo neighborhood in St. Paul. “Of all the forms of inequality,” the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.”
They serve the uninsured and underinsured, immigrants and impoverished neighborhoods. They almost had to close their doors this year until a combination of grants, layoffs and steep budget cuts kept the lights on.
So if you have any spare N95 masks, Open Cities could really use them. If you have a source for protective gowns, or face shields, or hand sanitizer, or disinfectant wipes, let them know.
If you have a few hours a week, they could really use some volunteers. Demand for COVID testing was so high that Friday, Open Cities had an orthopedic surgeon doing intake paperwork, an optometrist answering the phones and a psychologist bagging samples."
"June 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/stocks-healthier-in-countries-with-better-pandemic-response/571354132/,StarTribune,Stocks healthier in countries with better pandemic response,"The cure for the common stock market may be as simple as better policy. At least this year.
It makes sense that a better government response to the coronavirus pandemic would result in better public health. New data show that countries whose governments responded best to COVID-19 also experienced noticeably better stock market returns.
So far this year, countries ranked in the top half for their pandemic response saw their equity markets outperform by more than 7% as of May 31 (down 15.8% on average vs. down 23.1%). The study includes all “investable countries” outside the United States for which a country-specific exchange traded fund exists — essentially the S&P 500 equivalent for each country.
“We expected a difference in performance,” said Kurt Lieberman, CEO of Minneapolis-based Magni Global Asset Management. “But the size of the difference was larger than we expected.”
Lieberman and his team manage an international equity portfolio based on the assertion that good governance (regulatory climate, transparency, etc.) leads to better investment results. The strategy has been in place for 17 years, but a global pandemic turned out to be an ideal litmus test for Magni’s premise.
Like a storm spotter who sees a funnel cloud on the horizon, the potential disaster launched governments around the world into action (or, in some cases, inaction). The wide variety of strategies used to address COVID-19 and the global economic shutdown have been evaluated most often in medical terms: Total cases diagnosed, rate of disease spread, death counts, etc.
We also have tools to help quantify how those policies have fared in economic terms, specifically, a method to objectively rank the quality of each country’s pandemic response. That work was undertaken by the Malaysian government and Pemandu Associates, which compiled data from 184 countries to build a new “Global COVID Index.”
Magni then compared equity performance in the world’s “investable countries” to their corresponding COVID scores. Denmark, the best-performing stock market in Magni’s study, ranks third in the Global COVID Index. Taiwan (fourth), South Korea (fifth), and Switzerland (12th) were others with both high marks for COVID response and outperforming equities. Major European economies like the United Kingdom (157th) and France (150th) rank worse than 80% of the world. Both suffered stock market losses greater than 20%. Brazil (141st) fell more than 40%.
One notable outlier is Sweden, whose government made headlines for its laissez faire approach to COVID-19. Swedish equities fared better than average, down only 9% despite its policy response ranking No. 171.
The United States, if you’re wondering, ranks 126th.
There are, of course, many other factors influencing equity performance. Countries with economies more dependent on oil exports, for example, have been harder hit by collapsing crude prices. Currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar are far from equal. Countries where the virus appeared earlier may now be further along in their economic recovery than others.
Still, the overall correlation is obvious. Higher-quality public health policies have had direct economic benefits."
"June 22, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/osha-seems-to-be-sitting-out-the-pandemic/571429952/,StarTribune,OSHA seems to be sitting out the pandemic,"As states and municipalities relax shelter-in-place orders, the nation seems to be racing to get the economy back to something resembling the pre-pandemic era. Restaurants, malls, cinemas, day care centers and retail stores are reopening sooner than most medical professionals think is wise.
The risk is obvious to many businesses that stayed open as the coronavirus swept the country. Meat processing plants, for instance, have had among the highest rates of infection. Employees continued to show up to work at many such facilities, even as thousands of their colleagues tested positive for the virus. By one estimate, more than 27,000 workers in meatpacking have tested positive for the coronavirus, up sharply from 17,000 just last month.
Yet the federal agency meant to protect America’s workers continues to sit on the sidelines. Even as state after state reopens, and the number of infections continues to climb, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has so far refused to give employers clear rules to follow, allowing those that neglect worker safety to operate without fear of government penalty.
For months now, OSHA has relied on general guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, without making them mandatory, meaning businesses face no threat of enforcement action for noncompliance.
The courts have offered workers no relief — the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia this month dismissed a lawsuit by the AFL-CIO that would have compelled OSHA to issue emergency rules for worker protection, saying the agency can determine its own standards.
The result has been millions of essential employees forced to work under hazardous conditions. Now that threat is spreading to nonessential workers, too.
OSHA’s top administrator, Loren Sweatt, explained during a congressional hearing last month that general guidelines, rather than rules, allow the agency and businesses to adapt more quickly as the scientific and public understanding of the coronavirus changes. “Regulations are very cumbersome to revise,” Sweatt said.
But even when it has received credible complaints of unsafe conditions, OSHA has failed to act. Workers at a Nebraska JBS beef processing plant alleged in April that they and their colleagues remained in close quarters during lunchtime and in the locker room despite “a number of positive cases of COVID-19.” OSHA didn’t inspect the site and issued no citations; some 300 workers contracted the virus.
OSHA has received more than 5,000 complaints related to the coronavirus since the pandemic began. It has issued only a single citation, to a Georgia nursing home for failing to report employee hospitalizations within 24 hours."

Tim Walz on $841M in COVID-19 aid","Leaders of Minnesota cities and counties dealing with the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic are pressing Gov. Tim Walz to release $841 million in federal aid that was held up in a partisan stalemate at the end of the legislative special session on Saturday.
Local officials across the state watched with frustration as talks broke down over how to distribute CARES Act money Minnesota received two months ago to help communities and small businesses that have borne the costs of the pandemic.
A spokesman for the governor said Monday that Walz will address the federal funding this week and wants to get the money out as soon as possible.
Walz hinted during a news conference Saturday that he could act quickly, without the Legislature, to release the money. ""I can do it in the exact manner that [legislators] asked for in there, just with the authorities that we have,"" Walz said. A Legislative Advisory Commission needs to review the plan before aid is distributed.
The federal money is one of several issues left unfinished during the weeklong special session. Lawmakers also ended their work without agreements on police reform measures and a major infrastructure funding package.
Mower County Administrator Trish Harren said the federal money is needed quickly to ""triage the bleeding."" Her county is home to Hormel Foods and Quality Pork Processors, and has dealt with a coronavirus outbreak at its meat processing plants. She said they have supported mass testing, bought personal protective equipment and suffered lost tax revenue.
""There's just a lot of costs,"" Harren said. With the federal aid, she added, ""It won't have to be borne on the backs of our local property taxpayers who are already struggling.""
Mower County, like other communities, also needs the money to start a small-business support program to help prevent pandemic-related closures. Harren anticipates getting $4.8 million, about half of which she expects to go to small businesses to help them survive.
Five organizations that represent a combined 853 cities across the state sent a joint letter Monday to urge Walz to act quickly. They also asked the governor to extend a previously proposed deadline for spending the cash so cities can keep using it until Dec. 30. A trio of county organizations also sent a letter Monday calling for swift action by state leaders.
""Cities across the state have undertaken significant, often costly adjustments to local services to ensure public health and safety during this crisis,"" the city groups wrote.
Republican House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt and Rep. Pat Garofalo, the GOP lead on House Ways and Means, also pressed Walz in a letter Sunday saying timing is critical.
""These funds will help make our local governments whole for the tens of millions spent on COVID-19 response and testing, purchase of personal protective equipment for front-line workers, and can be used to help keep our struggling businesses that are the anchors of Main Streets throughout Minnesota,"" they wrote.
House DFL spokesman Ted Modrich said Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman also supports getting the money out to local governments as soon as possible.
State lawmakers struggled during the regular session with the formula for how much each municipality and county would get, but appeared to reach an agreement before the special session. Walz could have used his executive power to divvy up the money before last week's special session, but he said he opted to hold off to allow lawmakers to be involved.
GOP lawmakers said they thought a deal was at hand with DFL leaders before last week's special session. But the House Democratic majority subsequently included additional spending that had not been part of that agreement. The new spending included payments to tribes for opioid treatment, State Patrol and Corrections Department expenses, as well as more money for a cash assistance program for low-income families.
The Republican-led Senate, meanwhile, passed a bill with bipartisan support that would distribute the $841 million without additional spending that the Walz administration supported.
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said Friday night that Republicans were open to $58 million in additional spending to reach a deal.
Democrats had proposed nearly $146 million in general fund spending, which they said would be offset with revenue increases, grants and a fund transfer. But the two sides ended their work without a compromise, leaving open how the state would allocate the CARES Act money.
Walz said Saturday that Democrats were justified in seeking the extra state spending with the federal money. ""Much of that supplemental budget was working with the CARES Act, was working on the COVID thing,"" he said. ""They work hand in hand.""
But Gazelka said Monday in an interview with WCCO Radio that Democrats also had sought to link a deal on the CARES Act money to police reform, which turned into the DFL's top priority for the special session.
He said he heard from ""a number of Democratic legislators"" that Walz worked behind the scenes to condition support for the CARES Act plan to criminal justice reforms. Both efforts ended up failing.
Hortman told the radio station afterward that negotiations ""eventually just got timed out."""
"June 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-business-groups-bristle-at-suspension-of-visas-for-foreign-workers/571449472/,StarTribune,Minnesota business groups oppose visa suspensions for foreign workers,"Leaders of Minnesota’s major business groups said a national ban on hiring foreign workers will do little to help the U.S. recover from financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Those reactions came as President Donald Trump ordered the country to stop issuing visas for many foreign workers until Dec. 31. Trump said the temporary ban will spur hiring of Americans during a period of high unemployment.
With the country’s jobless rate roughly four times what it was before the COVID-19 crisis hit, policymakers and businesses are looking for ways to jump start the economy.
“Under ordinary circumstances, properly administered temporary worker programs can provide benefits to the economy,” the president said in an executive order. “But under the extraordinary circumstances of the economic contraction resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, certain nonimmigrant visa programs authorizing such employment pose an unusual threat to the employment of American workers.”
Business interests in Minnesota and across the country disagreed and promised to push back, lobbying Congress and the White House.
“We signed on with a bunch of Minnesota companies voicing our opposition to what the president has done,” said Shaye Mandle, CEO of Medical Alley, a trade group representing hundreds of businesses in Minnesota’s med-tech sector. “We oppose this, especially H1B visas. Those are engineering and science. The U.S. just doesn’t produce enough of those people to fill those jobs.”
At the top end of the scale, temporary H1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers offer intellectual and scientific expertise that makes U.S. companies more competitive in the world economy, said Charlie Weaver, who directs the Minnesota Business Partnership, a collective of the state’s top chief executives.
Institutions such as the Mayo Clinic depend on such talent to develop cures and treatments, Weaver said.
“High-tech companies have been complaining about this,” said University of Minnesota economist Tim Kehoe. “Some firms that need highly skilled workers won’t be able to get them.”
Scott Whitaker, president and CEO of AdvaMed, which represents U.S. med-tech companies, said in a statement that the group believes “this policy will have the opposite of its intended effect and [we] hope the administration will reconsider it.”
At the middle and bottom of the scale, seasonal workers from other countries fill gaps in the employee pool that will continue to exist despite the president’s order, added Doug Loon, Minnesota Chamber of Commerce president.
While Trump signaled that he was considering a temporary ban on temporary workers, his “timing seems extraordinarily bad,” Weaver said. “Our companies in Minnesota compete around the world. They need the best talent they can get” as they try to recover.
Kehoe predicted that sluggish movement of workers caused by the virus has forced companies to adjust.
Loon said a lack of seasonal foreign workers could hurt the state’s critical tourism sector. Without those employees, Loon said he has “concerns about the viability of resorts.”
It is not yet clear how Trump’s order would apply to seasonal workers critical to Minnesota’s agricultural sector. The ban does not apply to “any alien seeking to enter the United States to provide temporary labor or services essential to the United States food supply chain.”
While visas for temporary workers had already slowed precipitously because of COVID-19, the breadth and length of the order has local and state trade groups coordinating with national groups on a response. Among the talking points will be the entrepreneurial nature of H1B visa recipients and how they start companies of their own and create more jobs than they fill. Another major concern is a brain drain. If the U.S. does not want the talents of temporary foreign workers, America’s competitors likely will.
“There have been some issues with H1B visas in that some of the people [brought in] aren’t all that scarce, they’re just cheaper,” said University of Minnesota trade specialist Robert Kudrle. “But the government’s attitude toward immigration seems to treat all foreigners as if they represent a threat to Americans.”
The latest available federal data for fiscal 2020 show that the largest H1B employers in Minnesota are U.S. Bank National Association (99 initial and continuing visas), Optum Services (81), Medtronic/Covidien (66), Mayo Clinic (60), and University of Minnesota (53).
In addition to highly skilled workers, Trump’s visa suspension also applies to nonagricultural seasonal workers, foreigners transferred within a company with offices outside and inside the U.S. and cultural and educational exchange visas. The ban also extends to anyone traveling with visa recipients."
"June 23, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/responding-to-a-texas-sized-outbreak-of-covid-19/571473092/,StarTribune,Responding to a Texas-sized outbreak of COVID-19,"As Texas hospitals break records with regard to the number of new COVID-19 patients admitted, they’ve also grown uncomfortably close to nearing capacity. Last week hospitals in Dallas hit more than two-thirds capacity, and the trend continues to point upward.
Yet, despite this, reopening plans have continued. Restaurants are now permitted to function at three-quarters capacity. AMC, the world’s largest movie theater chain, is preparing to open in July in time for the highly anticipated spy film “Tenet,” and that follows Cinemark’s first phase of reopening this week.
We are simultaneously watching cases rise and Texas reopen, and there is no distinction as to how starkly contrasted those numbers need to be before we take a step back and re-evaluate.
It’s time for officials to draw that line for us.
The general public looks to the state to take initiative in trying times such as these; we expect its actions to reflect the extent of the precautions we must take, but right now these conflicting numbers undermine public confidence in government guidance. Many people are growing more wary, while many others seem to have discarded even basic safety precautions.
We need to know where the thresholds and guideposts are. We need a numerical threshold so that we can understand the virus in its context as we move forward, and we need a better understanding of how to apply what we have learned about the spread of this disease.
We suspect the numerical thresholds would reflect hospital capacity since the daily increase in cases also reflects how testing is becoming more widespread, but how exactly does that apply?
The White House guidelines to reopening suggest that states maintain a downward trajectory in coronavirus cases or a downward trajectory in the percentage of positive test results over a two-week period before moving forward. Neither has been the case in Texas. Yet we have continued with reopening plans. Why?
We’ve gotten too comfortable with the idea of the coronavirus being out among us, so much so that many people have let their guard down. Yes, treatment has gotten smarter as health care workers have grown more accustomed to working with the virus, but right now too many people consider these reopenings a sign that things have gone back to normal when, in reality, that is not true. As a community we don’t have an exact idea of what level of ease or severity we’ve reached.
We need a designated ceiling to indicate when we’ve hit the point where a re-evaluation is needed. We need the state to put forth a concrete point of comparison. If we approach that ceiling, Texans should then realize they need to increase their own precautions and that they’re based on more than a whim from Austin."

Simon’s office said he will follow a state court decision from a week ago that approved an agreement removing the witness requirement, a move that was sought in a lawsuit filed by the Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans Educational Fund.
Early voting in the August primary begins Friday.
But in a separate case brought by the League of Women Voters of Minnesota, a federal judge said Tuesday that a similar agreement went “well beyond” the concerns raised by a voter who said her health could be jeopardized by having to meet the witness requirement to vote during the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud called for a more narrowly tailored agreement to remedy specific harms cited by the league’s lawsuit.
Despite Tostrud’s opinion, Simon, a leading DFL proponent of mail-in voting, said his office will continue to waive the witness requirement in accordance with a decision signed last week by Ramsey County District Judge Sara Grewing.
“Today’s U.S. District Court ruling does not affect last week’s state court ruling that the consent decree is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the public interest. We are bound by the ruling of the state district court and will comply with the order,” Risikat Adesaogun, the spokeswoman for Simon’s office, said in a statement.
The Minnesota Republican Party and several GOP lawmakers have opposed the change.
The agreements stem from lawsuits filed by the two citizens groups contesting the requirement that people voting by mail need other registered voters to sign as witnesses. The organizations argued the rule was burdensome and endangered public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Simon’s office already started implementing the change to allow ballots without a witness signature, said Jonathan Diaz, the attorney for the League of Women Voters.
“This decision has no impact on Minnesota voters right now. It doesn’t change anything for them,” Diaz said.
Tostrud did not disagree with the league’s argument that some voters’ health could be jeopardized by the witness requirement during the pandemic. However, he said the consent decree the two parties reached — eliminating the need for witnesses for every Minnesotan who votes absentee — goes too far.
He said the sides haven’t established the need for “wholesale nonenforcement” of the requirement. He left unclear what would happen to the league’s case, saying, “There are many possibilities.”
The League of Women Voters and other groups are also pushing for the witness requirement to be lifted in the November election, but that has not yet been decided."
"June 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/st-paul-city-council-moves-ahead-with-tenant-screening-ordinance/571475772/,StarTribune,St. Paul City Council moves ahead with tenant screening ordinance,"The St. Paul City Council is moving forward with a tenant screening ordinance that would change how landlords use criminal histories, past evictions or credit scores when considering new tenants.
The council, which held a public hearing Wednesday on the proposed ordinance, has touted it as another step forward for the city's efforts to build equity while also curbing longtime barriers that often make it difficult for people with criminal backgrounds or evictions, low-income households and people of color to find affordable housing in the city's tight market. More than half of the city's residents are renters.
Kristin Burch, fair housing coordinator for the city of St. Paul, told council members that steps are being taken to work with city departments and community partners to help train landlords on how the ordinance would work.
""We are laying the groundwork and will be mapping out a more detailed process for you,"" Burch said. ""But I have laid out some steps in a process where we will be building an implementation team.""
The council is slated to take the proposed ordinance up again at its July 1 meeting. If approved, the ordinance would go into effect March 1 of next year.
Under the proposed ordinance, landlords would not be able to deny an applicant on the basis of a misdemeanor if the conviction is older than three years or because of a felony older than seven years. Landlords can still deny applicants who are convicted of distributing or manufacturing controlled substances and anyone on the lifetime sex offender registration.
The ordinance also would allow denials in cases of murder, kidnapping, arson, assault or robbery, manslaughter and criminal sexual conduct convictions older than 10 years.
It would not allow applicants' eviction judgments to be considered if they happened three or more years earlier. Insufficient rental history also won't be usable as grounds for denial unless the tenant withheld information in bad faith.
The proposed ordinance also limits how credit screenings are used, including preventing landlords from denying an applicant because of insufficient credit history. It also caps the amount landlords can charge for a security deposit at a month's rent.
Eric Hauge, executive director for Home Line, a tenant advocacy group, wrote in a letter to the council earlier this month that the ordinance is taking steps to ""address discrimination and power imbalances in rental housing that disproportionately impact communities of color."" He said the need for these policies has become more evident in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We have seen a significant increase in clients inquiring about threats of eviction, lease non-renewals and notices to vacate,"" Hauge said. ""This highlights the lack of basic protections that Minnesota tenants have to prevent involuntary displacement.""
Tenants rights advocates say that the ordinance gives a nod to the idea that screenings do not always give the full context of what might have been happening in a tenant's life to cause them to pay rent late or miss bill payments that hurt their credit score.
But many property owners have said they have not felt heard during the ordinance process and fear putting their tenants in an unsafe situation. They also worry that they will not have all of the facts they need to make sound decisions that could potentially prevent a future eviction filing. The potential costs of tenant relocation, fixing up damaged units and housing court fees would drive up costs for tenants in the future, they said.
Chad Scally, a property owner in St. Paul, told City Council members during the hearing that the ordinance ""will actually reduce the amount of affordable housing in St. Paul"" and that there needed to be more input from property owners.
""I'm hopeful you'll see the extreme damage this ordinance will do and work with property managers in developing tenants' rights that actually help tenants,"" Scally said.
Opponents of the ordinance have also raised concerns about the ordinance's ""just cause"" provision, which would require landlords to provide reasons on why they're terminating a tenant's lease. Those grounds could potentially include reasons like nonpayment of rent, repeated late rent, renovation of the unit, too many people occupying the unit or the tenant not taking steps to renew their lease as asked. If a new owner buying affordable housing properties refuses to renew any leases without cause, they'll be required to pay relocation assistance for tenants."
"June 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/walz-to-release-841-million-in-covid-19-aid-to-local-governments/571489812/,StarTribune,Walz to release $841 million in COVID-19 aid to local governments,"Gov. Tim Walz is moving to send out $841 million in federal aid to counties, cities and townships hit hard by COVID-19 after legislators failed to strike a deal to distribute the funds during a recent special session.
Walz announced the plan Thursday, nearly a week after lawmakers adjourned the session while at a partisan impasse over police accountability measures, a bonding bill and the federal aid. Without action, local governments were unable to tap into the funding to boost services during the coronavirus pandemic.
""This funding will bring much-needed relief to communities across the state as we continue to battle this pandemic together,"" Walz said in a statement announcing his decision.
Under the plan, local governments will get a direct portion of the funding based on population. The plan must get a stamp of approval by a legislative commission before the aid is distributed, but the Department of Revenue expects to start sending out the funding to local governments by the end of June.
In March, Congress passed the CARES Act — short for Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security — sending direct aid to states and municipalities with populations of more than 500,000. Most of that money, $1.87 billion, went directly to the state, with Hennepin County getting $212 million and Ramsey County $96 million. But the state's other cities, counties and townships didn't receive a direct allocation and have been waiting on a plan to distribute the money from state lawmakers.
Willmar City Council Member Audrey Nelsen said that after 90 days of waiting, she was ""happy and relieved"" to see the money distributed.
""COVID-19 has had a major impact on every corner of the state — even the areas that have not been hit by a wave of cases,"" she said. ""This funding will help local governments continue to deal with the public health crisis and start to revive their local economies.""
Local governments have faced plummeting revenue and rising costs during the pandemic, including first responder expenses, staff overtime, public health costs and economic assistance to small businesses. The funding can be used on government services, as well as grants to local businesses, hospitals and others impacted by the virus, but they cannot be used to make up for lost tax revenue.
League of Minnesota Cities Executive Director David Unmacht said cities set their budgets for 2020 last fall, long before the pandemic hit Minnesota.
""Since that time, cities have been forced to alter and modify their operations, purchase equipment and redeploy staff to address the challenges of maintaining essential services to residents,"" said Unmacht, whose organization represents more than 800 cities across the state. ""Although the federal funding cannot be used to replace lost revenue, the erosion of city revenue over the past several months have challenged cities even further as they continue to respond to the pandemic.""
The state has a process in place to distribute the aid through the Legislative Advisory Commission, a small panel of lawmakers who sign off on distributing federal funds when legislators are not in session. But Republican lawmakers wanted more input over the unprecedented amount of federal dollars flowing into the state through the CARES Act.
Legislators struggled during the regular session to strike a deal on how to distribute the money to communities. They said they were close to an agreement during the special session that would have included some additional spending, but the deal fell apart in the early hours of the morning Saturday, along with proposed policing changes and a more than $1 billion package of construction projects in a bonding bill.
On Thursday, legislators were supportive of Walz's move to send the money out, in part because he used the framework they debated during session.
""It is important that our local communities get that,"" said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake. ""As a result of shutting everything down and businesses not being able to pay taxes and do all of the things they do, all of our local governments are hurting right now.""
Local governments are facing a deadline to spend the money by early December and must return any unspent money to the state. The federal government could be sending another round of aid to help states and municipalities to respond to the virus.
Walz also announced $12 million in emergency support to food shelves across the state, which are facing a 30% increase in visitors during the pandemic."

Mayo announced in April it would cut pay to more than 20,000 people and seek an unspecified number of furloughs after a 50% revenue hit when elective procedures were halted by COVID-19 preparations. At the time, the clinic projected a loss of $3 billion by year-end if it didn't make changes.
The health system isn't back to its originally planned financial performance, but Mayo said patient volumes reached 85% to 90% of normal by mid-June — a quicker recovery than officials said they expected.
""We are in a much better position than we anticipated, and we're very pleased to be able to restore pay and end furloughs early,"" said Dr. Gianrico Farrugia, Mayo Clinic chief executive, in a statement.
Mayo Clinic is Minnesota's largest employer. For 2019, Mayo reported revenue of about $13.8 billion and paid expenses of about $12.8 billion, leaving $1.06 billion of income from clinic operations.
Mayo maintained strong financial performance through mid-March, according to a financial statement, but ended the first quarter with a much smaller margin due to a net operating loss for the month of March. That's when Minnesota and other states mandated delays in elective and nonemergency surgeries to conserve supplies for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients.
Pay cuts and furloughs at Mayo Clinic were in keeping with a trend this spring of job actions across the health care sector. The clinic told bondholders in April that cost-cutting moves included temporary salary reductions of 7% to 20% for executive, physician and senior administrators. Mayo also extended furloughs, temporary benefit reductions and a hiring freeze.
Minnesota hospitals were allowed to resume elective and nonemergency procedures starting early May. It has made a big difference for Mayo Clinic's financial performance.
""Because of these positive trends, Mayo Clinic will restore pay to pre COVID-19 levels for all staff except senior leadership in mid-July,"" the clinic said in a statement. ""The pay restoration will be realized in the July paycheck, months sooner than had been anticipated.""
Federal programs meant to help hospitals also have aided Mayo's financial performance this spring.
Since April 10, Mayo Clinic has received about $220 million in federal funds from various provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a $2 trillion economic relief package signed into law in late March by President Donald Trump. Mayo also received advance payments for providing patient care through a federal program, the clinic said in a financial statement.
Of the CARES Act funding, Mayo said it is ""only retaining those funds that can be directly attributed to the pandemic."""
"June 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/biden-s-best-option-for-vp-susan-rice/571486272/,StarTribune,Biden's best option for VP? Susan Rice,"In the history of political campaigns, no topic has a higher ratio of punditry to significance as the choice of running mates. It provides a refreshing break after the long race for the presidential nomination; it typically features many possible contenders; and it fills airtime on news and talk shows.
For all the attention it gets, the decision usually makes no difference. Paul Ryan was the dream 2012 running mate for Mitt Romney, for all the good it did him. Dick Cheney added zero political value, which didn’t stop George W. Bush from winning in 2000. Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, Geraldine Ferraro — none of them mattered at the polls.
But some vice presidents do matter in office. Mike Pence ran the coronavirus task force with slightly more competence than we have come to expect from this administration. Joe Biden spurred Barack Obama to endorse same-sex marriage. Cheney pushed relentlessly to invade Iraq.
The choice of a running mate is important, though, for what it reveals about the presidential nominee. When John McCain chose the abysmally unqualified Sarah Palin, he contradicted his slogan: Country First. When Bush picked Cheney, it showed that he valued substance more than anything else.
Biden has a harder decision, because his options are more limited. First, recognizing the political and historic importance of ending the male monopoly on our highest offices, he promised to choose a woman. Second, with the sudden national focus on racial equity, he is under heavy pressure to make it someone of color.
His decision is critical, if only because Biden, who will turn 78 in November, would be the oldest person ever to become president. He carries an outsized risk of dying or becoming incapacitated in office.
He can’t have great confidence that his No. 2 would remain in the spare-tire compartment. So Biden ought to give the highest priority to finding someone equipped to take over the presidency at any moment.
There is only one contender who meets that standard: Susan Rice, whose preparation puts her in a different league from anyone else in the running. During the Clinton administration, she worked on the National Security Council and served as assistant secretary of state for African affairs. She was Barack Obama’s U.N. ambassador and national security adviser.
Her background is a crucial asset in the area where a president has the greatest power, and where deep knowledge is the best safeguard against catastrophe. Rice would not need an education in dealing with Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, Israel or our NATO allies. She’s not only better equipped in foreign and defense affairs than the other vice presidential prospects; she’s better equipped than any president since Richard Nixon.
I say this though I often strongly disagree with her — as when she supported the Iraq war and our intervention in Libya. But her high-level experience is some protection against unnecessary risks. Any mistakes she would make would not be mistakes of ignorance or naiveté.
Rice’s resume is skimpy only on domestic matters, where the president has both less control and less risk of fatal mistakes. No one can doubt that, with her abundance of brainpower (Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, Rhodes Scholar), she would soon master that part of the job.
For all their talents, the other contenders look minor league next to her. Sen. Kamala Harris, a former district attorney and California attorney general, has spent most of her career in the narrow world of law and law enforcement. Likewise with Rep. Val Demings, a second-term House member who was chief of the Orlando Police Department.
Stacey Abrams’ highest office was as minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has worked only at the local level. Rep. Karen Bass of California has 15 years as a state and federal legislator but no executive experience. Any of these women might make a good president eventually — but none is adequately prepared today.
Rice’s chief handicap is political: Republicans pilloried her for giving inaccurate answers about the 2012 attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya. But her role was minor. Getting voters to elevate that episode above the coronavirus pandemic, the battered economy and Donald Trump’s racism would be next to impossible. For Republicans to pound the drum on Benghazi would be advertising their own irrelevance.
Death, Biden knows all too well, can come like a thief in the night. If it comes to him as president, a successor who is ready would be his priceless bequest to the nation."
"June 25, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-regulators-continue-to-support-2-6b-enbridge-pipeline-project-despite-oil-downturn/571489452/,StarTribune,Minnesota regulators continue to support $2.6B Enbridge pipeline project despite oil downturn,"Minnesota utility regulators Thursday rejected calls to again overturn their approval of Enbridge’s new $2.6 billion pipeline, considering whether the oil-market downturns tied to the coronavirus affected the project.
The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) voted 4-1 against reconsidering its Feb. 2 blessing of the controversial pipeline, a replacement for Enbridge’s deteriorating Line 3 that would transport Canadian oil across northern Minnesota to Superior, Wis.
“There is no question that COVID-19 has presented a number of unique challenges,” said PUC Commissioner Valerie Means. However, “COVID disruptions would not change the [long-term oil] forecast.”
Pipeline opponents are expected to appeal the PUC’s decision to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
Enbridge still must get other state and federal approvals for the pipeline, which has been winding through the Minnesota regulatory process for five years. The latest permit timeline means the Calgary, Alberta-based company cannot start construction until, at the earliest, the end of 2020.
As COVID-19 hammered the global economy, oil demand — and prices — collapsed. Demand and prices have rallied in the past month but are still well below the level needed for much of the oil industry to make money.
Canada has been particularly hit hard as its oil fields are particularly costly compared to those in the rest of the world. Several Canadian producers have significantly cut back production, reducing demand for space on Enbridge’s pipeline system.
Environmental groups and two Ojibwe bands asked the PUC to reconsider its vote based partly on the oil-market cave-in this spring, arguing it fundamentally altered long-term demand for oil, particularly from Canada.
Joe Sullivan, who started as a PUC commissioner in April after the PUC approved Line 3, called the reconsideration a “very difficult decision.” Still, “I don’t think the new issues raised are material to the original decision.”
Commissioner Matt Schuerger, though, said the PUC should reconsider its February vote and specifically address COVID-19 effects, as well as new evidence on climate change and the electrification of transportation.
“In my view, it is clear that new issues have been raised and there are contested material facts including COVID-19’s impact on the Canadian oil industry,” Schuerger said.
Schuerger, along with four other commissioners, originally voted for Line 3 in June 2018. But that vote was mooted when the Minnesota Court of Appeals shot down the PUC-approved environmental impact statement (EIS) for Line 3.
The appeals court agreed with pipeline opponents that the EIS needed to include more information about the possibility of an oil spill migrating into Lake Superior.
The EIS was revised and the PUC again approved the pipeline in February. But Schuerger changed his vote, saying significant changes had occurred since the PUC’s June 2018 vote, particularly around climate change and Minnesota’s electric vehicle policies.
Enbridge has said the pipeline is a critical safety enhancement, which the PUC has agreed with. The current Line 3 is corroding and therefore running at only half capacity. The new pipeline — which would be one of the largest Minnesota construction projects in recent history — would restore full oil flow.
Enbridge, in a statement, called Thursday’s PUC decision “another important step forward for the Line 3 replacement project. This decision is consistent with the law and based on full and complete review of the evidence.”
Winona LaDuke, head of the indigenous environmental group Honor the Earth, called the PUC “an embarrassment to Minnesota’s regulatory system. … The PUC needs to get in touch with the new reality: the era of oil is over.”
Environmental groups and some Indian bands have said the pipeline — which follows a new route — would open a new region of pristine waters to the prospect of oil spills, as well as abetting increased greenhouse gas emissions."

It was the third bonus workers have received during the past three months.
Full-time hourly associates and drivers received $300, part-time and temporary associates received $150 and assistant managers earned $400, the company said. Bonuses were given to associates who have been with the company since June 5.
“Walmart continues to look for ways to reward and recognize its associates while staying focused on their overall well-being and safety,” the Arkansas-based company said in a release.
Companywide, Walmart has invested nearly $1 billion in cash bonuses and other employee initiatives. Besides the bonuses, Walmart also bumped pay temporarily until May 25.
Deemed essential workplaces, many grocery companies have rewarded employees for the risks involved with working through the pandemic through efforts such as pay raises, bonuses and new benefits."
"June 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mask-use-should-rise-above-pandemic-politics/571513222/,StarTribune,Mask use should rise above pandemic politics,"It seems like a milestone: Face masks have begun to show up in roadside trash. Maybe it's an indicator that in the age of COVID-19, masks have become as common as gum wrappers and can be discarded with about as much care or thought. But it's a fitting symbol of the contempt with which some people view the masks and the leaders who mandate their use.
The masks, and the people who promote them, deserve better.
If there is some lingering confusion over whether and when we should wear face masks, authorities now offer clear answers: Yes, and always — at least when other people are around.
To be fair, the messaging on masks has not always been so plain. Early on in the COVID-19 era, experts said that ordinary people without symptoms should concentrate on hand-washing and leave mask-wearing to the professionals. That was before the distinctions among types of masks became matters of household discourse, and before most people even knew the difference between a respirator and a ventilator. It remains perfectly true that the highest grades of mask should be reserved for use by medical workers. But the lower orders of cloth masks should still have their place in the layperson's wardrobe, and on the layperson's face.
The imperative to wear masks in public would be clearer if President Donald Trump were willing to help set an example. He is not, and there is little use bemoaning the fact. A more helpful public leader is Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health. In an interview aired Wednesday on NPR, Fauci said this:
""I wear a mask. I'm a public health official. For better or worse, I'm very visible, so I want to set the example that people need to do that. … This is extremely important: Avoid congregation in crowds. If you feel you must do that — which I recommend you don't — then wear a mask at all times.""
Fauci also addressed what he called the ""really unfortunate"" partisan divide that makes Republicans less likely to wear masks than Democrats, and that leads some young people to act as if they're invulnerable. ""We're all in this together,"" he said. ""People don't appreciate that they are all part of a process, and the process is a dynamic viral outbreak.""
The implacable course of the coronavirus in the United States, with more deaths than any other country, has prompted the European Union to consider banning U.S. travelers when Europe reopens to most travel next month. That may be only fair, considering that Trump months ago imposed just such a ban on European travelers to the United States. But it is sobering to consider that in a worldwide pandemic, the United States is faring worst of all.
Last Thursday, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington projected an additional 57,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 by Oct. 1 without universal mask use, but 24,000 if masks are widely worn.
As Fauci suggested, this is not an occasion for political squabble. Republicans and Democrats are equally attractive to the virus, and they should take equal responsibility for helping thwart its advance. A closefitting cloth mask, preferably of several layers and covering the nose as well as mouth, isn't enough to stop the pandemic. People should also avoid crowds, practice social distancing, wash their hands and sanitize often. And while they're doing all of that, they might want to consider that a public health crisis could be an opportunity — finally — for a fractured country to find common cause."
"June 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-s-aversion-to-granting-visas/571513132/,StarTribune,Trump's aversion to granting visas,"We can’t tell you for certain whose interests are served by President Donald Trump’s latest executive order on immigration, which took effect Wednesday and suspends many new work visas through the end of the year. But we can easily tell you whose aren’t — those of American businesses and industry, and thus, of Americans who benefit from those companies’ innovation and success:
• “Putting up a ‘not welcome’ sign for engineers, executives, IT experts, doctors, nurses and other workers won’t help our country, it will hold us back.” (That’s from U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Thomas Donohue.)
• “We oppose this, especially H1B visas. Those are engineering and science. The U.S. just doesn’t produce enough of those people to fill those jobs.” (From Shaye Mandle, CEO of Medical Alley, a trade group in Minnesota.)
• “In my experience, these skillsets are net job creators. Visa reform makes sense, but this is too broad.” (From Tesla CEO Elon Musk.)
Sort of sounds like they didn’t want it.
So why do it? If we take the Trump administration at its word, the president has just signed a “Proclamation Suspending Entry of Aliens Who Present a Risk to the U.S. Labor Market Following the Coronavirus Outbreak.” That would seem comforting if the action were likely to produce the desired effect. But it’s not.
The order blocks visas for a variety of jobs — some skilled, some seasonal. It limits the ability of companies that operate in a global arena to arrange stints in the U.S. for nonresidents they already employ.
By one estimate — from the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute — it would keep 219,000 temporary workers out. According to the Trump administration, it will free up 525,000 jobs. One or the other must have the calculus wrong.
In any case, business leaders (as expressed by Mandle, above) don’t think they’ll be able to find workers with suitable skills if they can’t draw them from overseas. It isn’t as if Americans will fill the jobs instead.
So why do it?
One possible explanation can be extrapolated from a recent comment by former national security adviser John Bolton. In an ABC News interview about his now-available book “The Room Where It Happened,” Bolton said he didn’t see any decisions during his time working for Trump for which re-election wasn’t the major factor.
But that may minimize Trump’s underlying commitment to turning U.S. policy against immigrants. After all, his like-minded adviser, Stephen Miller, reportedly told supporters during a private call in April that coronavirus-related curbs on immigration were actually part of a long-term vision.
A separate example is Trump’s expansion of the number of asylum-­seekers subject to quick deportation — within weeks, with minimal investigation of their claims. On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such people, as newly arriving noncitizens, do not have the right to contest their cases in federal court."
"June 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/20-somethings-now-largest-covid-19-population-in-minnesota/571504962/,StarTribune,20-somethings now largest COVID-19 population in Minnesota,"Children and teenagers represent the fastest-growing age groups hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new data released Friday by the Minnesota Department of Health that included 5 more deaths and 498 more lab-confirmed cases of the infectious disease.
The number of lab-confirmed cases in Minnesota has increased 37% — from 25,208 on June 1 to 34,616 as of Friday — but the numbers among people aged 6 to 19 increased 61% in the same time frame. And 20-somethings overtook people in their 30s for the first time this week as the age group in Minnesota with the most lab-confirmed cases.
The 7,045 cases among people in their 20s now represent 20% of all cases. More infections in this population might not result in more severe outcomes — only two of 1,411 total deaths so far in the pandemic have involved people younger than 30 in Minnesota. But state health officials worry that these mobile young adults can spread the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to others at greater risk.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday updated its list of risks for severe COVID-19, doing away with the age of 65 as a breakpoint and instead simply stating that risk increases with age.
Minnesotans 70 and older make up 12% of known cases in the state, but 81% of COVID-19-related deaths. All five deaths reported Friday involved residents of long-term care or assisted-living facilities, bringing the total of deaths in such facilities to 1,112.
Obesity was added as a leading risk factor to the CDC’s list, which also includes heart conditions, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Hypertension was removed from the list, even though it is the most common underlying condition found in patients in Minnesota who are hospitalized for COVID-19, according to a state health analysis. CDC officials said that related heart conditions, rather than hypertension, are probably increasing the risks in such individuals.
On Friday, 335 Minnesotans were hospitalized for COVID-19 — including 157 who needed intensive care.
Free COVID-19 testing clinics in Minneapolis and St. Paul following the May 25 police killing of George Floyd found a relatively low rate of infections — roughly 1.5% of the more than 7,700 demonstrators and others who were tested. Health officials have been relieved that these mass events didn’t spread the coronavirus further, but are now tracking upticks in young-adult cases related to bars and restaurants.
Limited indoor service at bars and restaurants resumed on June 10 along with fitness clubs and entertainment venues. Minnesota had been under a stay-at-home order for 51 days to reduce the spread of the virus until the order was lifted on May 18.
Detected cases of COVID-19 via diagnostic testing are only the tip of the iceberg. CDC officials on Thursday estimated that every one lab-confirmed case represented 10 cases. Most infections result in mild or no symptoms, but people with mild infections are risks for spreading the virus to others.
Minnesota’s COVID-19 case count includes 30,008 people who have recovered to the point they are no longer considered infectious or required to isolate themselves to avoid spreading the virus to others."
"June 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/hum-or-hold-your-breath-how-to-protect-against-covid-19-when-someone-gets-too-close/571504742/,StarTribune,Hum or hold your breath? How to protect against COVID-19 when someone gets too close,"We know that we can get the coronavirus by breathing in respiratory droplets exhaled, coughed or sneezed by someone with the disease.
So does it help to hold your breath when you pass mask-free strangers on the street, or when you have to share a public bathroom, or crowd into an elevator with other people?
“I’ve done about 750 national and international interviews now"" on the COVID-19 pandemic, said Dr. Gregory Poland, a Mayo Clinic professor of medicine and infectious diseases and director of the Mayo Clinic’s vaccine research group. “Nobody has asked me that one.”
But Poland’s response: Why not?
“If you’re not breathing in, you’ve dramatically cut down the risk logically,” he said.
In fact, he said he and his family hold their breath during brief encounters with other people.
“When we’re going by people and you have to be unavoidably close, hold your breath,” he said. “You have reduced the risk of breathing it in at no cost.”
Dr. James Johnson, a University of Minnesota Medical School professor specializing in infectious diseases, also said holding your breath can make sense in some situations.
“Part of the risk of catching the virus is from what’s in the air when you inhale. So if you can avoid inhaling while in a high-risk micro-environment (elevator, vicinity of somebody who coughs or sneezes), sure why not,” Johnson wrote in an e-mail.
It’s already something many of us have been doing.
Jason Larson, a triathlete, trail runner and stair climb racer from Golden Valley, said when he encounters someone else while on training runs, “I adjust my breathing so I’m not inhaling when I’m downwind of someone.”
Scott Otey also has been holding his breath when he gets near other people in the grocery store. And he can do it for minutes on end. The Janesville, Wis., man is a spear gun hunter and free diver who dives underwater without scuba gear.
He teaches other people free diving, and he said with a little training most people can hold their breath for longer than they think.
“In an elevator, when you’re not moving, you can probably do two minutes,” he said. “Anybody can do it.”
Both Johnson and Poland, however, said holding your breath should not be a substitute for the primary tools we have to avoid spreading the virus: social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing.
You may avoid breathing in the virus if you hold your breath when someone coughs near you, but if virus-laden droplets land on your body or clothing and you touch them with your hands and then touch your nose, mouth or eyes, you still may get sick.
Poland also cautioned that holding your breath may be counterproductive in some situations.
If you’re close to others and can’t hold your breath long enough to move away, you’ll typically exhale forcefully when you have to start breathing again.
If you’re infected and don’t know it, “you have now spread that virus for about 30 feet around you,” Poland said.
Or you’ll take a deep breath in, which defeats the purpose if you’re still near the people you were trying to avoid.
Breathe right
When you breathe, at least breathe through your nose, urges Louis Ignarro.
Ignarro is a pharmacologist who got his doctoral degree at the University of Minnesota. He became a co-recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his research on nitric oxide, a gaseous molecule that causes blood vessels to relax and widen.
Ignarro’s research into nitric oxide led to advances ranging from the Viagra pill to treatments for premature babies with failing lungs.
In addition to improving lung function, nitric oxide (which should not be mistaken for nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas) has antiviral and antibacterial properties.
Now researchers are conducting studies to see if inhaling doses of nitric oxide gas can be used to treat people with coronavirus or even prevent health care workers from getting the disease.
We also naturally generate nitric oxide in our nasal passages when we breathe in through the nose.
So Ignarro has recently been writing articles urging everyone to inhale through the nose during the pandemic.
“It’s good to breathe through the nose, not the mouth, because then you’re going to get that nitric oxide into the lungs,” said Ignarro, a retired professor from the UCLA School of Medicine.
Johnson said that breathing through the nose can filter out particles and keep them from getting into the lungs.
“The problem here is that [COVID-19] multiplies quite nicely in the lining cells of the nose and upper throat, so it may not need to get to the lung initially to establish a ‘foothold,’ ” according to Johnson.
Ignarro admitted there isn’t scientific proof that breathing through your nose will ward off COVID-19, and people should still be taking other precautions. But he said it can’t hurt to try breathing through the nose behind your face mask.
“It’s a logical guess,” he said. “If you don’t have the virus and you breathe in through the nose, you just might be able to prevent that coronavirus from settling down in the lungs.”
And breathing through the nose is a good idea generally, according to James Nestor, a journalist who just wrote a book about breathing practices called “Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art.”
According to Nestor, the nose “filters air and gets rid of particulate. It conditions it and humidifies it so that air that enters the lung from the nose is so much easier to process for the lungs.”
Humming along
But to really increase nitric oxide, Nestor suggests humming.
Studies have shown that nasal nitric oxide can be increased 15-fold by humming compared with normal, quiet breathing.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, some health practitioners were touting the benefits of humming to improve conditions like sinus infections or the common cold.
Nestor said if he encountered someone coughing on the streets of San Francisco where he lives and he couldn’t get out of the way, “I would hum,” he said. “Not only are you increasing that nitric oxide, you’re also slightly exhaling,” rather than breathing in.
“People are going to call this quackery or pseudoscience,” Nestor said.
But unless you hum so much that you get dizzy, what’s the downside?
“People are going to look at you and think you’re a weirdo, but that’s fine. Hum on by,” Nestor said."
"June 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/early-voting-underway-for-august-primary/571522862/,StarTribune,Early voting underway for August primary,"Early voting for Minnesota's Aug. 11 primary kicked off Friday. The state could see a jump in people voting by mail or at early polling locations over the next month and a half, as residents attempt to avoid Election Day crowds during the coronavirus pandemic.
The national spotlight has been on primary battles elsewhere, including Kentucky, where Democrats picked their challenger to compete with Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. And in New York, Democrats aimed to send Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez back to Congress along with newcomer and fellow progressive Jamaal Bowman.
Minnesota also has contested primary races, from Congress to the state Legislature. Here are some of the heated battles.
Contested primary races
U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar will face off with Antone Melton-Meaux. A Federal Election Commission report of ActBlue donations showed Melton-Meaux raised $1.5 million in May. Omar, a prolific fundraiser whose campaign finance reports show a big cash advantage over Melton-Meaux, responded with a tweet saying, ""When you push power, power pushes back.""
In the divided Minnesota Legislature, there are interparty battles across the state. Democrats have a significant majority in the House, and Republicans hold the majority in the Senate by a smaller margin.
Democrats are dueling to occupy spots left open by retiring House members, including Laurie Halverson, of Eagan, and Ben Lien, of Moorhead. Incumbent DFL representatives also face challengers in the heart of the Twin Cities.
Rep. Ray Dehn, who represents parts of downtown and north Minneapolis, lost the DFL endorsement to attorney Esther Agbaje. Another lawyer, Athena Hollins, is opposing Rep. John Lesch, whose district includes St. Paul's North End and Payne-Phalen neighborhoods.
House Republicans have a rematch between former Rep. Bob Loonan and Erik Mortenson for a Shakopee-area seat. Mortenson beat the incumbent Loonan in the last primary but lost to DFL Rep. Brad Tabke.
Two Republicans — Marianne Stebbins, of Mound, and Andrew Myers, of Minnetonka Beach — are vying to take on Democratic Rep. Kelly Morrison, who represents many communities around Lake Minnetonka.
In the Senate, GOP Sen. Scott Jensen is retiring, leaving open the seat in the western suburbs that includes part of Chaska, Waconia, Watertown and Norwood Young America. Two Republicans and two Democrats are competing for the job.
Two incumbent Senate Democrats lost the party's endorsement to insurgents. Sen. Erik Simonson, who represents most of Duluth, will face off with endorsed attorney Jen McEwen.
And DFL-backed challenger Omar Fateh is attempting to unseat Sen. Jeff Hayden, who represents the south Minneapolis district where George Floyd was killed. Hayden has been at the forefront of the recent push for police accountability at the Capitol."
"June 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/covid-19-forces-closure-of-health-care-collaborative-in-minnesota/571532542/,StarTribune,COVID-19 forces closure of health care collaborative in Minnesota,"A Minnesota business group that earned national accolades for efforts to improve health care is shutting down because of the economic fallout from COVID-19.
The Bloomington-based Minnesota Health Action Group is planning to close in September after the pandemic severed financial support from member companies, said Mamie Segall, the group’s president and chief executive.
In the 1990s, employers across the country followed the group’s pioneering health insurance program where employees shopped for care based on cost and quality. More recent work promoted better care at clinics and enhanced mental health benefits.
“It’s really the only place where employers as purchasers were part of the conversation and leading efforts around health reform and health improvement,” said Jennifer Lundblad, president and chief executive at Stratis Health, a nonprofit that’s been a member of the group.
“They’ve been around for 30 years doing this work,” Lund­blad added. “The fact that an organization with such a history, with such engagement from the employer community … can’t make it through the economic crisis caused by coronavirus, I think, is pretty distressing.”
Employer-sponsored health plans provide coverage to about 150 million Americans, so corporations often talk about how they might use their size to drive health care changes. A high-profile example came in 2018 with the launch of a health care company from Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon — the celebrity CEOs of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
With the average cost of family coverage in employer plans now exceeding $20,000, some companies are trying to change the role of intermediaries like insurance companies in order to save money and promote quality. It’s an idea that dates back to the Minnesota group’s work in the 1990s, which the Wall Street Journal described at the time as “one of the most innovative campaigns in the nation’s war on health care costs.”
Just last year, the nonprofit was talking about reinventing the concept to tackle high drug costs. But on Friday, member companies voted to ratify a shutdown on Sept. 30.
The pandemic’s economic upheaval meant some members couldn’t pay dues, Segall said. Revenue from the group’s annual health care summit took a hit this spring, she added, when COVID-19 concerns forced the event to an online format. Members also couldn’t invest in a new mental health program.
“In our community history, they were extremely important,” said Jon Christianson, a health policy researcher at the University of Minnesota who studied the nonprofit’s early years.
Employers often cut expenses like the health care initiative in tough times, he said, even though the programs could deliver long-term benefits. The Minnesota group is one of several regional health care initiatives that have struggled, he added, as growth at member companies means many employees no longer live near headquarters.
“This is not simply here — it’s nationwide,” he said.
Originally, the nonprofit was known as the Buyers Health Care Action Group. Created in 1988, its members included Dayton-Hudson Corp., Pillsbury, Norwest Bank and General Mills.
With the group’s Choice Plus program, big employers in the Twin Cities provided data to workers so they could select among competing networks of doctors and hospitals based on cost and quality. Workers paid lower premiums if they opted for a higher-value network.
For a while, the program seemed to deliver the promise of health reform. Employees paid attention to data when choosing care networks, research showed, and there was some evidence of cost restraint without hurting quality.
But choice Plus never achieved a critical mass of enrollees. And employers started dropping out to take advantage of lower prices offered by health insurers.
By 2005, the group shifted its focus to Bridges to Excellence, a program that provided financial rewards to clinics where patients did better in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, vascular disease and depression. Over 12 years, employers backing the program paid out more than $6.5 million to high-performing clinics.
After taking the name Minnesota Health Action Group in 2013, the nonprofit launched studies to detail why costs were high and widely variable for conditions ranging from back pain and spine treatments to joint replacements and specialty drugs.
Most recently, the group focused on the issue of mental health benefits after noting the sizable toll depression takes on worker productivity, medication use and well-being.
Last year, the nonprofit won a federal grant to study gaps in mental health care, so leaders are now looking for a way to transfer the work to another organization, said Nance Lee Mosquera, employee benefits manager for the city of St. Paul and a board member.
“When it’s pure headwinds, you can have the best intentions in the world and it doesn’t mean you can necessarily achieve your goals,” Mosquera said. “But no, I’m not ready to say that we can’t effect change.”
The Minnesota Health Action Group’s board voted in May to wind down the nonprofit’s activities. With six employees, the nonprofit is scheduled to close Sept. 30.
The economic consequences of the pandemic have hit hard for the group’s members and supporters, Segall said. Their financial struggles have sapped resources the nonprofit needs, she said, to effectively work on health care quality while making the system more efficient and affordable.
The group is going away, but Segall predicted employers will find other ways to promote the nonprofit’s goals.
“I think given the continued rapid increase in health care costs … I don’t think employers can afford to not actively engage and pay attention,” she said. “It’s too important. And I think the work will continue.”"
"June 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/still-in-short-supply-n95-masks-used-over-and-over/571533522/,StarTribune,"Still in short supply in Minnesota, N95 masks used over and over","Imagine breathing through a face-hugging N95 mask for an entire eight-hour nursing shift on a hospital floor.
Properly fitted, it clings tightly to the skin, protecting the wearer from breathing in pathogens such as the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
But those filtered-out germs don’t just vanish — the novel coronavirus can live up to 72 hours on surfaces, masks included. Just touching the outside of a contaminated respirator is risky, and it’s considered the biggest danger of reusing them.
Yet three months into the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses and other clinicians are being forced to reuse hospital masks in ways that would have gotten them written up a year ago.
Maplewood-based mask-maker 3M Co. said Friday that despite doubling its production of N95 respirators this year, global demand continues to far exceed the supply for the entire industry. With too few respirators to go around, hospital administrators are left to decide how best to protect their staffs, even as some evidence suggests health care workers are transmitting the virus among themselves while at work.
Contract tracing shows 4% of health care workers in Minnesota who have unprotected exposure to COVID-positive co-workers test positive within 14 days, though it’s not possible to rule out community transmission. All told, health care workers, including hospital staff, make up about 10% of Minnesota’s 35,549 lab-confirmed cases.
That number grew by 523 cases Sunday, according to the Minnesota Department of Health’s daily tally. MDH also said eight more people have died of COVID-19 in Minnesota, bringing the number of deaths to 1,425 across the state.
Tight-fitting N95 masks — designed to protect the wearer by trapping 95% of particles of a specific tiny size — are in such demand that hospitals are doing everything they can to extend a mask’s life, from storing them in paper bags hanging on the wall to using UV light and hydrogen peroxide to clean and disinfect them.
Paper bags, UV light
Rather than using and discarding several N95s per day, a common practice before the pandemic, nurses and other clinicians now wear a single mask for an 8-hour shift or longer. That mask is then used again for up to five nonconsecutive shifts, hospitals and nurses say.
After that, the masks are often put in storage in preparation for a future surge.
To kill the virus, some hospitals are using machines that zap the masks with ultraviolet light, or bathe them in vaporized hydrogen peroxide. A more common strategy, described in guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is to put used masks in separate paper bags where they can air out until any virus dies.
Barb Galle, a registered nurse, said guidance on reusing masks well past their intended life is influenced more by supply problems than safe-practice considerations.
“Why would you think that it’s OK to wear a potentially contaminated mask, from room to room to room?” said Galle, a float nurse at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System, speaking in her role as president of the American Federation of Government Employees Professional Local 3669. “In a nurse’s heart and mind, that is so disgusting.”
A Minneapolis VA spokesman said the hospital has held its COVID-19 employee infection rate to 0.74% of its workforce, and it is providing all employees with required personal protective equipment (PPE).
Hospital officials say they have no choice but to reuse masks because the global supply remains constrained ahead of a potential second wave of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.
“We do safely reuse N95 respirator masks to conserve supply now and ensure we’ll have enough in the event of a COVID surge,” David Martinson, spokesman for Bloomington-based health system and insurer HealthPartners, said via e-mail. “While it’s difficult to predict how a second wave might impact PPE levels, the decontamination methods we use have helped us conserve N95s and keep our patients and colleagues safe, and we’re confident in our supply quantity.”
Health systems like Allina Health and North Memorial Health stressed that they’re following mask-use guidance published by the CDC and the U.S. Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
“We are confident in the level of PPE protection that’s provided to our staff and patients, whether that be a surgical/procedural mask or an N95 when treating COVID patients,” wrote Christine Hill, spokeswoman for Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis.
Covering the mask
N95s protect the wearer, while looser-fitting surgical masks and cloth masks worn in public protect the people around them by blocking microscopic droplets in their breath that can spread the virus. In hospitals and clinics, health care providers sometimes wear surgical masks or full face shields over their N95s to preserve the mask.
In the government recommendations, mask decontamination is depicted as a strategy of last resort.
Guidelines from the CDC urge a wait-and-reuse approach before considering disinfecting. The CDC says respirators from other countries may be considered, though the Food and Drug Administration has said certain masks made overseas are no longer authorized for distribution in the U.S.
OSHA says decontamination voids the approval granted by the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
“Still, during periods of shortages ... when other preferred alternative respirators ... are not available, filtering facepiece respirator decontamination and reuse may need to be considered as a crisis capacity strategy,” the OSHA guidelines say.
NIOSH says three methods offer the “most promise” for cleansing and purifying N95 masks: vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and “moist heat” from water heated in an oven.
Methods that NIOSH said should be avoided, because they damage the mask, include dry heat, 70% isopropyl alcohol and microwave irradiation.
Federally funded study results published this month in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases noted that using VHP resulted in the best combination of rapid decontamination and least damage to the mask. UV light killed the virus more slowly, the study said, but preserved mask function “almost as well.”
The study, using 3M’s Aura N95 respirators, concluded that the masks can be reused up to three times after being treated with UV or VHP.
3M does not recommend decontaminating its masks. But in light of the government guidelines on doing so, the company has been publishing technical bulletins, the latest of which finds that its N95 respirators can be cleaned without affecting the fit or function 10 to 20 times, depending on which FDA-authorized device is used.
Mary Turner, a critical care nurse at North Memorial Health Hospital and president of the Minnesota Nurses Association, said she’s not happy about having to use one N95 mask over five work shifts. But it is better than having to use them for 10 shifts, as was the case at the start of the outbreak.
“I’m not going to be totally comfortable with the whole situation until we’re back to using the optimal standards that we learned in nursing school,” she said. “I can’t say that I’m truly OK with any kind of reuse. But that being said, it is what it is.”"
"June 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/congress-had-a-chance-for-bipartisan-police-reform-both-parties-failed/571545972/,StarTribune,Congress had a chance for bipartisan police reform. Both parties failed.,"WASHINGTON – After Americans reacted in outrage to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Republicans and Democrats in Congress promised quick action on police reform.
Leaders on both sides offered a long list of ideas: a ban on chokeholds, an end to “no-knock” searches, and more.
Then, last week, the Senate deadlocked on the issue almost as quickly as it had vowed to act.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., proposed a GOP bill with relatively mild measures that had been approved by the White House. Democrats pronounced the Republican bill so weak that it was “unsalvageable” and blocked it. Senate Republicans in turn refused to take up a House bill passed by Democrats.
Each side denounced the other, and a once-bipartisan goal suddenly appeared unreachable.
It was only one legislative failure among many; Congress’ reputation for gridlock has been richly earned.
But this one was a special tragedy. Most of the public, reacting to the gruesome video of Floyd’s death, wanted some kind of legislation. Republicans and Democrats who spoke to each other — a minority on Capitol Hill — said they believed compromise was possible.
What went wrong? Both sides behaved badly. Each surrendered to internal political pressures.
That wasn’t surprising, especially in an election year, but it was still disappointing. This bill could have been an exception to the rule.
I called Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who usually votes with Democrats, to find out why the bipartisan push failed. King had voted with Republicans to allow McConnell’s bill to move forward.
He said he thought it was a mistake for Democrats to block the bill.
“I think there was space for a compromise, and now I’m afraid we’re not going to get anything,” he told me. “My concern was that if Democrats refused to go forward, McConnell would say, ‘OK, I tried,’ and move on — and that’s pretty much what happened.”
But King also faulted the Republican leader for refusing to let Democrats participate in drafting the bill.
“The only way to get things done in the Senate is with a bipartisan process,” he said. “This was a bill on a very complex topic drafted by one party.”
Even as McConnell cut the Democrats out, he submitted his bill to the White House to make sure President Donald Trump wouldn’t denounce it.
That’s a normal part of legislating — but in the process, some measures were watered down.
Initially, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the bill’s main author, said he wanted to ban or limit no-knock searches, which have led to fatal police shootings of innocent people. When the proposal emerged, it merely called on the Justice Department to collect data about no-knock warrants.
The result was a bill that had broad support among Senate Republicans but fell far short of what Democrats had promised their supporters.
“There is overwhelming opposition to the bill in our caucus,” Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said. The desire for party unity on each side meant the ground for compromise kept shrinking.
McConnell said he would allow Democrats to try to amend the bill, but Schumer said that offer fell short of a guarantee.
“There’s a fundamental lack of trust between the two sides,” King told me.
In the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Democratic majority can pass bills without Republican help, a mirror-image process occurred: A Democratic bill passed with almost no GOP participation.
It included bans on chokeholds and no-knock warrants, limits on police officers’ immunity from lawsuits and a publicly available database of police officers with disciplinary records.
On all those issues, King argued, compromises might have been possible.
A bipartisan majority could agree to ban chokeholds except when a police officer’s life is in danger, strict restrictions on no-knock searches, and even perhaps stripping police officers’ immunity to lawsuits if they violate their departments’ policies (although police unions have long resisted any change).
There was plenty of blame to go around.
Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, pointed at the Republican leader.
“The way McConnell set up the process almost guaranteed this outcome,” he said. “If he had wanted bipartisan legislation, he could have gotten it either by turning the issue over to the Judiciary Committee (which includes members of both parties) or by forming a bipartisan group. He did neither.”
Frances E. Lee, a political scientist at Princeton University, said the Democrats were responsible, too.
“It’s clear that Democrats believe that they would be better off preserving the issue for the election,” she wrote in an e-mail. “A negotiated outcome would force Democrats to accept far less than what they want … [and] muddle the clarity of the party’s election message.”
There are two morals to this story — one all too familiar, the other less so.
The first is that in a polarized and closely divided Congress, bipartisan deals are almost impossible, especially in an election year.
But the countervailing message is also striking: On some issues, if the public demands action, both parties will try to respond.
That was true when Congress passed a series of bills to counter the economic shock of the coronavirus lockdowns. And it was true in Congress’ initial reaction to the death of George Floyd.
Like King, I think it would have been better if Senate Democrats had allowed McConnell’s bill to move ahead, and tested his promise that they could amend it on the floor.
They chose otherwise. Now McConnell can either walk away from the issue — or he can try again, with a bigger dose of bipartisanship. But only one force can compel the Senate leader and his colleagues to move: loud, sustained pressure from the public."
"June 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/an-adjustment-here-an-adjustment-there-soon-you-re-talking-real-money/571571162/,StarTribune,"An adjustment here, an adjustment there, soon you're talking real money","It will be interesting to see just how much “adjusting” for the coronavirus pandemic will be going on as companies start reporting their financial results for the just-ended second quarter.
The hope, as always, is for clarity. That’s a goal that gets harder to reach if executives want to try to present the numbers as if a pandemic wasn’t really happening.
Some companies have an accounting calendar that doesn’t match up perfectly with the regular calendar. As a preview of what to expect during the upcoming earnings season, consider what Apogee Enterprises Inc. last week reported from its fiscal quarter that ended in May.
It reported earnings of 11 cents per share, and “adjusted” earnings of 15 cents a share. By adjusted, it meant that it had recalculated the bottom line as if it had not spent $1.4 million or so in expenses directly related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
In its first footnote, Apogee said the adjustment was mostly related to additional labor costs as staff had to miss work due to the virus, plus the cost of additional protective equipment for workers.
These are the costs of doing good things to meet a big challenge, of course, such as making sure the workplaces are safe. Good for them. But these are things lots of businesses have been spending money on.
Patterson Cos. and H.B. Fuller Co. also announced their latest results last week, too. And while their executives acknowledged the effects of COVID-19 on business, neither decided to present additional “adjusted” financial results to explain those effects.
Both, however, made other adjustments to get to an adjusted bottom line. H.B. Fuller all but said that “adjusted EBITDA” is its key measure of profitability.
It’s no defense of adjusting numbers for the virus to point out that investors see adjusted financial information all the time. As a measure of profitability, the kind of number presented by H.B. Fuller can even reveal more than the bottom line under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
Just to be clear, the GAAP results are always there, and there are rules about any other numbers disclosed, too. It’s certainly true that the adjusted profitability number is always bigger, as management teams add back expenses to the earnings total that might be outside of the everyday costs of operating the business.
Tweaking the profitability numbers in this way is so common that it’s even possible to sign up for seminars on how to “add back” expenses to boost the historical profitability of a business being put up for sale, to make it seem more valuable.
One of the first tasks of any serious buyer, of course, is digging into it to see if any games were played.
What H.B. Fuller used, a version of what’s called EBITDA, is enduringly popular. Sometimes called cash earnings, EBITDA is one of those terms from finance that has to be unpacked even for lots of business people.
The first part means earnings before accounting for interest and taxes, or “EBIT,” and to know whether the day-to-day business makes money, that makes some sense. The “D” and “A” refer to depreciation and amortization, which are bookkeeping measures to record some the expense for an asset used by the business for a long time.
It can make sense to add those back, too, because these capital assets likely have already been paid for even if the expense just can’t be recognized all at once.
One thing to remember when adding back depreciation, though, is that computers and other equipment become obsolete or break all the time, and new stuff will need to be purchased. Yet at least with this EBITDA calculation, flaws and all, everybody can easily figure out what’s in it.
That’s not so easy with adjustments to account for the effects of a global pandemic.
Several companies have reported an EBITDAC number in their financial results, with one of the first cases reportedly being a German manufacturing firm controlled by an American private equity investor. The “C” tacked onto the end of this adjusted profitability measure meant they also added back the financial impact related to the coronavirus.
Nobody will know what is in the adjustment for C or will really be able to judge if it captures the total effects of the coronavirus pandemic, even if management can say how much was spent on protective equipment.
Perhaps to try to nip this practice before it blossomed, the Fitch credit-rating agency pointed out in June that its analysts will be ignoring any adjustment for the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We view such measures as unreliable and open to manipulation,” Fitch added. And its arguments against this practice were all sound.
The pandemic effects are marketwide, for one thing. And it’s difficult while going through this crisis to really know whether corporate performance is being affected by something like competition.
Also, to quantify and then add back the effects of “C” suggests that whatever these effects are they are just temporary. Well, maybe. No one knows how long this crisis will last or how much different the world will be, including the purchasing habits of customers, after the pandemic finally subsides.
Then there is the impact of good surprises, and H.B. Fuller CEO Jim Owens described one last week for investors and analysts on a conference call. H.B. Fuller, he said, had just repurposed a kind of disinfectant usually used in cases of water damage and started selling it to kill the novel coronavirus.
Looking ahead to when the big slug of companies start reporting their quarterly results, it’ll be as important as ever to hear from senior managers what’s happening in their business, the good and the bad. Investors will still need to know what they plan to do.
But please, let the numbers speak for themselves."
"July 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/u-s-economy-right-now-top-of-the-parabola/571607312/,StarTribune,U.S. economy right now: Top of the parabola?,"In the financial markets, there's a pattern known as a ""dead cat bounce."" The evocative phrase is perhaps another relic that should come up for reconsideration in our more carefully worded times, yet the concept is real: After a rapid fall from a great height, there's somewhat of a rebound off the bottom. But it fails to retrace the entire drop before stalling and falling again.
The question for today is whether this is where the U.S. economy is now.
The monthly jobs report came out Thursday. It showed that 4.8 million jobs were added and that the unemployment rate is 11.1%. Both data points reflect continued improvements after the dramatic declines that followed the full-fledged emergence of the coronavirus.
Take most any other measure you can think of — consumer spending, small-business health, the stock market itself — and you'll see a similar pattern. It didn't just go splat; it rebounded optimistically. But it's leveled off now without having returned to the prior peak — in most cases, not even close.
That makes sense, given the resurgence of the coronavirus in many places, the threat of new shutdowns and the approaching expiration of emergency unemployment benefits. Everything turns on the pandemic and the response. Some hope Americans can rescue themselves by more reliably wearing face masks, preventing the need for widespread reclosures. Another reason to wear them, if you needed one.
The patterns on the financial charts do look like a classic dead cat — er, bear market — bounce, but there's still a chance we're just seeing a cautious plateau en route to better times. In any case, aren't cats said to have nine lives?"
"July 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/what-if-the-feds-sent-you-1-200-every-month/571602372/,StarTribune,"What if the feds sent you $1,200 every month?","On a bitter-cold spring night 14 months ago, back in a more magical time when all things seemed possible in the 2020 president race, I stood on the steps leading down to Washington’s great Reflecting Pool waiting to hear from the most unlikely and arguably intriguing Democrat of all, the businessman and political neophyte Andrew Yang.
Before Yang spoke, a stream of supporters went up to a microphone and, with the Lincoln Memorial looming behind them, said they had a dream that a Yang presidency would also mean his cornerstone policy idea — a check for $1,000 from the federal government, delivered to every U.S. adult every month.
The mostly young supporters said Yang’s proposal for “universal basic income,” or UBI, would free them from the ups-and-downs of “the gig economy” that had entrapped so many Americans in their 20s, or allow them to chase a creative passion. One woman was an artist and a freelancer who said her family had disowned her for coming out as gay and “Andrew Yang is the only presidential candidate right now who would offer protection in scenarios like mine.”
Still, not everyone who heard Yang that night in April 2019 was sold. One Baltimore woman who showed up out of curiosity wondered what the drug dealers on her block would do with their $1,000 check. I also had doubts — about his vague plan to pay for it with a value-added tax that he said would fall heavily on tech companies, and on the overall cost that even Yang himself said could be $2.8 trillion a year.
Flash-forward to 2020, and while Yang is no longer a candidate, America just had a trial run of UBI, under less-than-ideal circumstances. Pressed by the coronavirus lockdown and a surge in jobless claims that has surpassed 40 million, Congress and President Donald Trump raced out with a stimulus plan that sent a one-time $1,200 payment to all but the wealthiest adults.
In a big, messy country (and with some folks still waiting for the check), many families are struggling. But the check clearly helped prevent a crisis from becoming a calamity in a number of households. The money allowed millions with no income to pay the rent, buy groceries or other goods (even more so for those who received a temporary $600 weekly boost in unemployment checks).
Many of America’s iconic consumer brands — Walmart, Best Buy, Apple, Wendy’s and more — reported a healthy uptick in sales in late April, when the checks arrived (and some are surely terrified of August, when the supersized unemployment checks end). For one month, the idea that Yang floated largely as a hedge against the automation of American jobs seemed to instead protect the workforce from a pandemic. Not surprisingly, some economists and pols wonder if — given the vagaries of U.S. capitalism in the 21st century — UBI should be permanent.
An open letter from more than 500 academics pleaded for UBI as the COVID-19 layoffs spread — writing that “[s]ocieties where a large majority of the population works in the informal sector will be hit especially hard — beyond earnings, there is next to no safety net” — and Spain’s left-leaning government has embraced the idea. What does Yang think now? I asked him.
“Millions of Americans received the $1200 stimulus and loved it,” Yang told me via a Twitter Direct Message. “It didn’t transform their personalities or make them lazy. It did give them the ability to buy groceries and keep a roof over their heads, and reduced their stress levels and gave them a sense of security.
“That’s what we need as we are down tens of millions of jobs and will be for quite some time. Seventy percent of Americans support emergency cash relief for the duration of the crisis. We should do this all of the time.”
Yang’s point is a good one, and the recent events have me thinking about how the burdens of capitalism — not just McJobs but things like student debt — have kept folks too beaten down to fight for change, and how that’s been reversed in the George Floyd protests.
But I’m not completely sold and here’s why. The coronavirus and the protests have exposed that America has more needs than dollars, even borrowing at record low interest rates. Universal health care and college and wiping away student debt — I’d try those things ahead of UBI and the flat-screen TVs that come with it. But let’s revisit the Yang plan in a year or so."
"July 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/state-prepares-to-release-100m-in-housing-assistance/571607812/,StarTribune,Minnesota prepares to release $100 million in housing assistance,"State housing officials are preparing to give out $100 million in housing assistance to prevent evictions when the federal government’s $600-a-week unemployment subsidy ends July 25, but many fear that won’t go far enough.
The COVID-19 pandemic sidelined thousands of workers and drained the savings of Minnesotans with low-income jobs who were already struggling to afford a tight housing market. Many are now bracing for the end of the weekly federal assistance that has helped them scrape by.
“We went into the pandemic really in a tough spot and the pandemic has made it even harder,” said Ryan Baumtrog, assistant commissioner of the state’s housing finance agency. “We just want to avoid as many evictions as we can, as much displacement and as much potential increased homelessness as we can.”
For months, Minnesota lawmakers have discussed spending $100 million in housing aid. But they have yet to distribute the money.
Lawmakers said Gov. Tim Walz could use federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act dollars, but he has held off as the Legislature tried to negotiate a broader housing package.
So far, those efforts have come up short at the Capitol. Lawmakers are preparing to return for another special session in mid-July, but legislators on both sides of the aisle said they expect limited action on housing.
The housing negotiations fell apart amid disagreements over policy changes and the scale of state borrowing. Republicans, who have the majority in the Senate, want to loosen regulations on developers. Sen. Rich Draheim, R-Madison Lake, said regulatory adjustments could help lower housing costs.
But lawmakers agreed they need to get the $100 million to renters and homeowners who cannot keep up with their rent or mortgage. “The clock is ticking on that,” said Draheim, who said Walz should have given out the money earlier.
The state does not have a specific date planned to start releasing the aid, Baumtrog said. He said Minnesota Housing is waiting on Walz to notify the Legislature and give the housing agency the authority to start distributing the funds.
How the agency would use the $100 million is still being worked out. State officials are considering whether to give out one month of aid to a broader set of people or provide longer-term assistance to a smaller group, Baumtrog said. The demand is likely to exceed the amount that’s available, he said.
The Minneapolis nonprofit HousingLink surveyed 926 renters in June to ask what they anticipate after the federal government benefit ends in July. If additional assistance is not provided, 26% of respondents said they will not be able to continue paying rent.
The pandemic has spiked the national unemployment rate to its highest level since the Great Depression. Many whose hours have been cut, or jobs eliminated, are protected by Walz’s eviction moratorium — which Baumtrog expects will be extended beyond the current July 12 expiration date.
While tenants haven’t been evicted, some have anxiously watched unpaid rent bills stack up, said Hamza Hassan, a housing organizer at African Career, Education & Resource, Inc.
“Right now people are really only getting by through that [$600 weekly assistance],” Hassan said of assistance and unemployment benefits. “This has been the only means of … being able to pay their rent and get groceries for their families.”
While Minnesota Housing works on immediate assistance, legislators are still negotiating a longer-term public infrastructure borrowing measure. The so-called bonding bill could include money to help with the pent-up demand for affordable housing.
Rep. Alice Hausman, DFL-St. Paul, said she has been told the numbers lawmakers are discussing behind closed doors are fraction of the $276 million Walz initially proposed to borrow for housing. What the final deal will be — and whether legislators can agree to pass a bonding bill in the upcoming special session at all — remains to be seen.
“Uncertainty, I guess, is the word of the day,” Hausman said. But if the state continues to delay action on bonding, it could set back housing and other projects, she said, adding, “You run the risk of having lost a whole construction season.”
Hausman and housing advocates, meanwhile, pushed for $500 million in total bonds to support housing. They have continued to call for the funding as the coronavirus has battered the economy.
“For the state to not make significant investments at this particular moment in housing will have huge long-term consequences for us,” said Kari Johnson, policy co-chair of Homes for All coalition. She said one of the state’s biggest mistakes during the Great Recession was not pursuing development of more affordable housing earlier.
However, bonding requires the state to make additional debt payments, and Republican lawmakers have said the state should limit such expenses while facing a projected $2.4 billion budget deficit.
“Not all bonds are cheap,” Draheim said. “And housing bonds are one of them that is not cheap.”"
"July 3, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/this-new-coronavirus-wave-isn-t-like-the-old-wave/571617342/,StarTribune,This new coronavirus wave isn't like the old wave,"When New York City’s COVID-19 epidemic peaked in late March and early April, the city was reporting more than 5,000 new confirmed cases a day, and more than 60% of tests for the disease were coming back positive. In Arizona, which has a similar if somewhat smaller population (7.3 million vs. 8.3 million), new cases are currently averaging about 3,000 a day and about 20% of tests are positive.
Things may keep getting worse in Arizona, and its COVID outbreak may eventually surpass New York City’s. But it’s a long, long way from getting there, and I’m guessing that it won’t. That isn’t to say that things are looking good in the Grand Canyon State, or in Texas, Florida, Southern California or any of the other places now experiencing big growth in coronavirus cases. But the specific conditions that enabled the awful explosion of the disease in New York City are not being replicated.
The most important of those conditions was a near-total lack of awareness and understanding of what was going on until it was way too late. By the beginning of March, when New York’s first COVID-19 cases were confirmed, more than 10,000 people in the city may have already been infected, according to a modeling exercise conducted in April. With a reproduction number (the number of people each person can be expected to infect) that has since been estimated at above six in late February and early March, that total subsequently exploded. A new study of blood samples taken from non-coronavirus patients at Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in the city indicates that as many as 800,000 New Yorkers may have been infected by the week of March 16, when the city closed schools and many began working from home (the state’s stay-at-home order went into effect March 22).
The second half of March was also when testing for the disease began to get off the ground in a big way, but by that point demand was so overwhelming that only those with severe cases or underlying conditions could get tested, hence the sky-high positivity rates. By mid-April, according to an antibody survey conducted by the state at the end of the month (see footnote), about 1.7 million New Yorkers, 20% of the city’s population, had contracted the disease, or 12 times the number of confirmed cases up to that point.
In Arizona, more than 15,000 people are now being tested daily — a level that New York City didn’t reach until May. The percentage testing positive has risen from 9% to 20% over the past month, a sign that the testing isn’t adequate to keep up with the spread of the disease. But COVID-19 is not raging out of control as it was in New York in March, at least not yet. Data scientist Youyang Gu, creator of one of the better coronavirus forecasting models out there, estimates that 330,028 Arizonans had contracted the disease as of July 1, about four times the confirmed-case number.
Although the Trump administration’s repeated claims that the recent upturn in confirmed cases is due entirely to increased testing are wrong, the big increase in testing does imply that this upturn probably isn’t as big as that of March and April. This is the now familiar chart of new confirmed COVID-19 cases nationwide, courtesy of the COVID Tracking Project:
Now here’s an attempt to adjust the numbers to better reflect reality. I’ve used a simple rule of thumb, multiplying the number of new cases reported each day by the rolling seven-day positive-test percentage times 100:
The thinking is that higher positive test rates equate to more missed cases, although the true relationship is unlikely to be exactly as shown here. On a national level, my formula delivers plausible-ish results, showing 29.6 million Americans, or 9% of the population, infected so far, a little less than twice Gu’s estimate, which is based on deaths from the disease, and a ratio of estimated cases to confirmed ones of 11.5, not far from the 10 times higher recently suggested by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield. Apply it to New York City’s testing data, though, and you get a total of 10.3 million infections, which seems a bit high for a city of 8.3 million inhabitants.
In any case, the basic message that COVID-19 cases were much more severely undercounted in March and April than they are now is almost certainly correct. The Sun Belt outbreaks are thus of a lesser speed and scale — so far, at least — than those that hit New York and a few other metropolitan areas in spring.
What comes next is, of course, the big question. I’m no epidemiologist, and even epidemiologists have struggled mightily to predict the effect that differing degrees of social distancing, testing, contact tracing, quarantining and other public health measures have on the spread of COVID-19. In a totally naive population, with no access to testing and no habit of wearing face masks, it can spread shockingly fast. If everybody stays home, it hardly spreads at all. In between are countless potential combinations of public policy and individual behavioral changes with impacts that are extremely hard to model.
It does seem safe to assume that we won’t see the sharp drop-offs in new infections that have occurred in New York and other early COVID-19 hot spots since April. The draconian measures that enabled them aren’t going to be repeated, and the new outbreaks are both too big to be controlled just with contact tracing and quarantining and too small to have rendered a significant share of the population at least temporarily immune to the disease.
Still, I’m willing to bet that the Sun Belt outbreaks won’t keep spiraling out of control either. Recent reproduction numbers in these states have been estimated in the 1.2 to 1.4 range, not the 6-plus that may have prevailed in New York early on. States and cities are cracking down on some of the likeliest channels of disease spread, such as bars. Republican opposition to mask-wearing is fading, at least among elected officials and Sean Hannity. Perhaps most important, once people actually know others who have become ill with the disease they tend to take it a lot more seriously and adjust their behavior accordingly. In Harris County, Texas (home of Houston), one of the first places to raise alarms in this wave of infections, new cases appear to be on the decline.
If the same happens in other hot spots in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida and elsewhere in coming weeks that will be welcome news, but it won’t be much of a victory. Hospital intensive-care units will probably still hit capacity. Tens of thousands of Americans will die unnecessarily. New York City’s COVID explosion in February and March was the product of a spectacular failure of imagination and governance in the wake of similar disasters in Wuhan, China, and Northern Italy. Today’s Sun Belt outbreaks are the products of failures less spectacular but in some ways more maddening, given the great advances since early March in testing capacity and knowledge about how the disease spreads.
The choice now isn’t between opening the economy and letting COVID-19 rage. It’s between implementing a few targeted policies (indoor mask-wearing; restrictions on bars and other indoor settings most conducive to transmission; investments in contact tracing and other public-health efforts) that could probably bring the disease under control, and just letting it continue to spread like this — dragging down the economy the entire way — until we have vaccines and better treatments."

Tim Walz requests federal aid to repair damage during unrest,"Gov. Tim Walz requested aid from the federal government on Thursday to help rebuild and repair structures in Minneapolis and St. Paul that were damaged in unrest that followed George Floyd’s killing.
The request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asks President Donald Trump to declare a “major disaster” for the state of Minnesota. Federal funds would be used to reimburse local governments as they remove debris and begin repairs.
Days of unrest followed Floyd’s May 25 killing in Minneapolis police custody, with more than 1,500 buildings damaged by fires, looting and vandalism.
The Walz administration said a preliminary damage assessment found more than $15 million of eligible damages directly related to fires, but the total cost of the damage was more than $500 million.
“The social and economic impacts of this incident will be felt for years if not decades,” Walz wrote in a letter to FEMA.
That makes it the second most destructive incident of civil unrest in the nation, according to Walz, following the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.
Post offices, pharmacies, grocery stores and many small businesses were among the casualties. Walz said state finances are already stretched thin responding to the coronavirus pandemic."
"July 4, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/pandemic-is-a-focus-in-southern-minnesota-congressional-race/571620022/,StarTribune,Pandemic is a focus in southern Minnesota congressional race,"In a part of Minnesota that’s home to both the Mayo Clinic and a devastated agriculture industry, the coronavirus pandemic has taken center stage in a congressional race that’s shaping up to be neck-and-neck this fall.
Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn and Democrat Dan Feehan, who fought two years ago to one of the closest congressional margins in the country, are rematching this year in a district that’s been hit particularly hard by the virus. Feehan’s second try will test whether Democrats can gain ground in areas where President Donald Trump was broadly popular in 2016.
Stretching across southern Minnesota along the Iowa border, the First District is dotted with farms already buffeted by international trade battles that are now struggling amid widespread restaurant closures. Virus outbreaks in meat processing plants in Austin and Worthington have rattled the region’s ag economy.
The district is also home to tens of thousands of health care workers, including many at Rochester’s Mayo Clinic, which has been heavily involved in COVID-19 testing and research.
“Not only do we have the agriculture influence, but our rural communities that surround us, many, many of those people work in the city and they work at Mayo Clinic, so they understand the health aspects of this and the economic aspects of it,” said Rochester Mayor Kim Norton, a former DFL state lawmaker who is publicly neutral in the race.
Hagedorn and Feehan offer a clear contrast in their views on how best to respond to the pandemic.
Hagedorn is a staunch defender of the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic. He cited his own support for the Paycheck Protection Program, an employee-retention tax credit for small businesses and aid for Mayo Clinic and rural hospitals in the district.
He’s also been a vocal critic of Gov. Tim Walz, who ordered closures of schools, bars and restaurants and other public spaces in March to limit the spread of the virus. Walz has started to reopen bars and restaurants with restrictions, but Hagedorn says it’s not enough. He wants a full reopening of the economy.
“We had way too many small businesses and restaurants go broke. Minnesota customers were going over the border to do shopping in South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin and North Dakota, and our businesses and our people have suffered,” said Hagedorn, a former congressional staffer. “I thought he has misplayed this and should have been spending his time protecting those most vulnerable in our long-term care facilities.”
But Democrats say people in the district have struggled to connect with COVID-19 resources that Hagedorn said he’s brought in; and they accuse him of downplaying the seriousness of the pandemic in his social media posts. Hagedorn shared a discredited video on Facebook of two California doctors who said COVID-19 isn’t worse than the flu and dismissed the benefits of social distancing. That video was denounced by medical experts and removed by YouTube for spreading misinformation.
Dr. Rozalina McCoy, a primary care physician and researcher at Mayo Clinic, penned editorials in the district saying she was “shocked” that Hagedorn was “willing to traffic conspiracy theories that downplay the pandemic that has impacted our entire community.”
Feehan said the idea that the public health response is separate from the economy is false. Even some businesses that can reopen haven’t yet, he noted, because they’re worried about a spike in cases and endangering their own employees.
“They are intricately tied together,” said Feehan, a veteran and former teacher who lives in North Mankato. “Our economy will never thrive unless we deal with the public health side, until we deal with COVID, and we continue at the federal level to not deal with it.”
The First District has swung between the two parties over the years, supporting both Barack Obama and Donald Trump, who beat Hillary Clinton in the district four years ago by 15 percentage points.
Before Hagedorn, Walz, a Democrat, represented the district in Congress for 12 years. Hagedorn beat Feehan in 2018 by roughly 1,300 votes out of nearly 300,000 cast.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee quickly put Hagedorn on its list of targets this fall, citing his vote against a bill to lower prescription drug prices and his support of a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act.
Feehan said there’s a direct link to corporate interests that support Hagedorn and the votes he takes in Congress on health care issues, something that’s “especially insidious” during a pandemic.
“It crosses a party line because southern Minnesotans are independent-minded,” Feehan said.
Hagedorn said the prescription drug pricing bill would have “picked winners and losers” and potentially blocked the development of new cures because of how the pharmaceutical industry would have reacted.
The issue is personal for him, Hagedorn said. In February 2019, during a routine checkup, he was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer. He’s now undergoing immunotherapy treatment and doing well, he said.
“I’m a living testament to someone who is using a biopharmaceutical cure that was approved by the FDA almost the day I had been diagnosed,” he said.
Denny Schminke, a Republican activist in Mower County for more than a decade, said he’s struggling to handicap what might happen in the race. A retired Hormel employee, he’s been devastated to see the euthanization of hogs in the area as the food industry struggles.
He’s not sure the pandemic will change people’s votes this fall, but he thinks impassioned opinions on the topic will increase turnout in November.
“People’s teeth are really on edge,” Schminke said. “I see their feelings on COVID being an explanation point behind why they voted the way they were already going to vote.”"

Recovery depends on bringing the new coronavirus under control, yet each day brings record numbers of new cases. Little wonder people are making anxious analogies to the Great Depression.
If these comparisons have merit, we may be in for some lasting changes. It’s conventional wisdom that the Great Depression created a generation of penny-pinchers, but it wrought more subtle transformations as well — in the way people cooked and in how they spent their leisure time. The evidence from the 1930s suggests that life hacks made during hard times have a funny way of outliving the crises that beget them. Something similar may be underway today.
Consider, for example, what happened to the nation’s culinary habits in the wake of the Depression: Wasting food became a deadly sin, and leftovers that might previously have ended up in the garbage or down the drain found their way into new dishes.
Nothing was discarded. After boiling vegetables, cooks would save the water — “vegetable liquor” — to use in soups and sauces. Likewise, vegetables left uneaten on the first round would be puréed, combined with other rejects and presented anew. Housewives often resorted to camouflage to conceal this regifting.
A common strategy was to hide leftovers beneath a generous helping of “white sauce,” a condiment made from condensed milk, butter, salt, flour and water. It was a rare dish in the 1930s that didn’t include a generous helping of this wonderworking sauce. And what of all the leftover white sauce? It would end up in soups, as did most things at some point.
As historians have noted, attempts to combine disparate ingredients from nearly empty pantries led to strange mash-ups. Corned beef salad, for instance, featured gelatin, canned peas, lemon juice, cabbage and other odds and ends. Gelatin enabled cooks to bind all sorts of disparate ingredients into a jiggly blob.
Mass-produced processed foods also made their debut in the Great Depression: condensed soups, canned meats and other staples. These novelties saved time, money and cooking fuel. And they could be used in combination with other ingredients to create casseroles.
The casserole had made its debut during the economic depression of the 1890s and returned again during World War I. But the Great Depression elevated it to culinary stardom. Cooks in the 1930s also sought out substitutes for meat, creating various vegetarian versions of meat loaf — including peanut loaf, bean loaf, even lima-bean loaf. Naturally, these loaves often came generously dressed with white sauce.
Most American cooks kept up their Depression-era habits into the 1950s. If you look at postwar recipes, you can see how closely they resemble those from the 1930s. Processed foods and weird casseroles maintained their grip on the American palate until the 1970s and ’80s.
The Great Depression had even more enduring effects on how Americans spent their leisure time. Suddenly, people had more of it, whether they wanted it or not. And they aimed to fill it as cheaply as possible. During the Depression, the white, middle- and upper-class families stopped hosting formal dinners or meeting friends at the country club and instead prepared cheap, informal buffet suppers at home. They also rediscovered their own backyards, adding furniture, outdoor grills and vegetable and flower gardens. All of this “sheltering in place” allowed people to entertain themselves at home.
People began playing Monopoly and other complex board games. Cheaper still, and enormously popular among white-collar workers, were challenging card games such as contract bridge. By 1931, some 20 million Americans, about a fifth of the population, played bridge. People in the working class preferred poker and blackjack.
The very idea of having a hobby — a structured, goal-driven leisure pursuit — became immensely popular. People took up stamp collecting, coin collecting, woodworking, even bird-watching.
These new habits also persisted long after prosperity returned. Much of the suburban ideal of the postwar era was built around cheap, homegrown leisure pursuits that came into vogue in the 1930s.
It’s perhaps too soon to know whether today’s crisis will leave so indelible a mark. But we have already seen a huge uptick of interest in at-home leisure activities, from vegetable gardens to backyard swing sets to board games. Perhaps the twin traumas of a pandemic and economic catastrophe will mark a broad revival of habits forged in the Depression.
That may not be so bad. Just steer clear of lima-bean loaf."
"July 6, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/gop-legislator-under-scrutiny-over-covid-19-comments/571637602/,StarTribune,State Sen. Scott Jensen says he's being investigated by the state medical board for COVID-19 comments,"State Sen. Scott Jensen, a physician and Republican from Chaska, said Sunday that he is being investigated by the Minnesota State Board of Medical Practice for public statements he’s made about COVID-19.
Jensen criticized the state Department of Health in April for following federal guidance stipulating when doctors should characterize deaths as due to COVID-19. He said he feared that the death toll might be inflated if each state’s allocation of federal funds depended on the number of COVID-19 deaths.
His comments, made in a series of interviews with TV personalities from North Dakota to Fox News in New York, went viral. Some charged they fueled conspiracy theories and disinformation about the coronavirus. He told the Star Tribune in April that he felt his words were taken out of context.
Jensen could not be reached for comment Sunday.
In the video, he said the board is focused on two allegations: spreading misinformation about the death toll and providing “reckless advice” by comparing COVID-19 with the flu.
“When I got this letter, I was ticked,” Jensen said in the video, which had been viewed nearly 110,000 times by Sunday evening.
Jensen said he will cooperate fully with the investigation, adding that he didn’t know who filed the complaint and that he felt “targeted.”
“If this could happen to me because of my views, it could happen to anybody,” he said.
Jensen has expressed other controversial views on public health. He opposes state-mandated vaccinations for children, believing it to be an issue of parents’ rights. He also has defended President Donald Trump for talking about the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for COVID-19, though it has yet to be medically approved for the coronavirus."
"July 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/mail-in-voting-can-keep-all-of-us-safer/571620942/,StarTribune,Mail-in voting can keep all of us safer,"Call it absentee voting or mail-in voting, but the practice of sending in a ballot rather than casting it in person is nearly as old as the republic and, until recently, relatively noncontroversial.
Employed more widely during the Civil War to allow soldiers to vote from the battlefield, absentee voting is legal in every state and is both time-tested and dependable. It now has the added virtue of being nearly contact-free, which could literally prove a lifesaver in the upcoming primary and general elections.
Minnesota has been more fortunate than some states that now face nearly uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus. Nevertheless, COVID-19 has taken much from us — too many lives, health, economic vitality. We need not let it take our ability to vote when a safe, secure alternative exists.
That makes the polarization we are seeing over mail-in voting not only maddening but downright frightening. President Donald Trump continues to spread baseless lies about mail-in voting, calling it corrupt even though he, his vice president and others close to him have relied on it for years.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon had planned to mail out ballots to all registered voters, as some states have done, but encountered ""huge pushback"" in the Legislature, where Republicans opposed any loosening of absentee ballot requirements.
Their opposition is particularly confounding given that, according to Simon, 130,000 Minnesotans already live in communities that rely almost exclusively on mail-in ballots. In counties such as Kittson and Lake of the Woods, Simon said, 80 to 90% already vote by mail, and without incident. Requiring voters to request an absentee ballot ""just forces voters to take one more step,"" he said, and costs the state more money, both to process the requests and send out ballots.
Nevertheless, filling out a form will get you ballots for the August primary and the November general. If you are already registered, the usual witness signature requirement is waived by consent decrees Simon agreed to when older voters challenged the requirement in court. Republicans are attempting to intervene by challenging those decrees.
Even without witness signatures, absentee ballots are counted only if information matches personal identifying information supplied by voters, Simon said, making them secure from mailbox theft. Voters sign them under penalty of perjury, and the number of actual voter fraud cases remains extremely small.
The upcoming elections pose challenges not encountered in modern times. The prospect of voters lining up for long periods — maybe wearing masks, maybe social distancing, maybe not — to use the same, small voting booths and handle the same marking pens is daunting indeed. Then there's the danger to the 30,000 volunteers needed to spend hours inside schools, churches, community centers and other indoor spaces to help process ballots.
There is something satisfying about trooping to a precinct place with your neighbors, popping your ballot into the machine and getting that little iconic ""I Voted"" sticker as a testament to your good citizen status. But many Minnesotans may want or need to make a different calculation this time, opting to keep themselves and others safe.
That's not a partisan issue. It's just good sense."
"July 7, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/the-600-benefit-ends-in-july-economists-are-not-optimistic-about-what-happens-next/571667002/,StarTribune,The $600 benefit ends in July. Economists are not optimistic about what happens next,"DETROIT – Sandra Smith lost her job when restaurants shut down for dine-in service in March. The waitress didn’t start receiving unemployment until June, even though she applied in April.
While she recently went back to her job as a waitress at the restaurant Calexico in downtown Detroit, it’s not the same as before. Smith is making less than half of what she did, due to the restaurant operating at half capacity and less demand.
She is planning to file for partial unemployment benefits because she’s working less than full-time, but is worried about the extra $600 federal benefit expiring at the end of July.
“It’s definitely going to be a struggle without extra pandemic assistance,” said Smith, 37, of Detroit. “Without the pandemic money, I’ll have to live day-to-day. I’ll pretty much always be broke until things pick back up.”
For Smith, the benefits provided a lifeline, helping her to pay rent and utilities, and to put food on the table for the three children she has at home.
That benefit officially ends nationally at the end of the month, but will expire on July 25 in Michigan because of the way the state’s unemployment payment schedule is set up.
Moving forward, claimants receiving unemployment benefits will collect money only from the state, which maxes out at $362 a week. That’s unless Congress approves new legislation extending the $600 extra benefit.
By and large, Democrats are pushing for an extension, either at the full or a reduced amount, while many Republicans argue the $600 encourages claimants to not go back to work because they make more collecting unemployment.
“The $600 made it so that people could get by,” said Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst of the Washington, D.C., nonprofit National Employment Law Project. “It prevented the economy from collapsing.”
The extra weekly payment of $600 is part of the CARES Act, a $1.8 trillion package Congress passed to help the country face the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.
The effects of the benefit going away are already being felt, or will be soon, economists say.
“I’m really concerned about what happens to the economy particularly closer to the last week in July if they haven’t extended the $600,” Evermore said. “The economy hasn’t collapsed and that’s remarkable. Benefits like the $600 are what will keep us afloat.”
Evermore points to a recent study from the nonpartisan, nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, which said that if the $600 benefit were extended for a year, until July 2021, Michigan’s gross domestic product would be boosted by 6.6% and it would support the employment of nearly 200,000 workers.
Economists say it’s likely the benefit has thus far been spent mostly on rent and utilities — not big-ticket purchases.
The $600 federal assistance was not just intended as a way to keep workers and the economy afloat. It was intended to keep more people at home during a health crisis, and give them a cushion to do so.
If the benefit ends, and more workers who are vulnerable or have unsafe jobs resume work, cases could ultimately rise.
“My concern is people are more likely to go back to unsafe work,” said Evermore. “That’s not good for the economy” if businesses are forced to close.
But for some people, there’s simply no job to reclaim.
“If you cut off that benefit for them, many of them will be facing severe hardship,” said Charley Ballard, a professor of economics at Michigan State University.
He said those jobs that aren’t coming back are usually those that involve close personal contact, such as jobs at restaurants, hair and nail salons, and in the airline industry. Those jobs typically pay less and are held by women and minorities, leading them to be disproportionately affected.
Ballard proposes a solution that he thinks would benefit both employees who are back at work and those who have no job to reclaim: keep paying $600 to those who can’t find employment and reduce the partial benefits for those who have returned to work.
“What the law doesn’t do is distinguish between two very different people,” he said. “If you have people looking at an extended period of unemployment without an additional cushion, many of them will be facing destitution.”"
"July 8, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/testing-delays-possible-despite-stable-covid-19-phase-in-minn/571682602/,StarTribune,Testing delays possible despite stable COVID-19 phase in Minnesota,"Minnesotans seeking COVID-19 testing should be prepared for delays in results amid a national surge in cases of the infectious disease that is stretching testing supplies and laboratory capacities again.
While delays this summer are different from those at the start of the pandemic — when global shortages limited testing to select populations — they could result in people waiting as long as eight days to find out if they are infected with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Supply problems are not changing Minnesota’s current broad guidance, which allows testing in the absence of symptoms if people have been exposed to others who have COVID-19, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.
“Just want people to be aware … that you may need to be prepared for a longer wait time for lab results,” she said.
The rising case count and testing backlogs nationally come at a middling moment in the pandemic in Minnesota, which on Wednesday reported eight deaths and 463 lab-confirmed infections of the COVID-19 virus.
Totals in Minnesota have reached 1,485 deaths and 39,589 known infections. While case counts have increased in recent days, they are well off their peaks in late May.
Cases have surged among young adults and teens — with cases doubling in the 19 and younger age group since June 1 — but hospitalizations have not. The 265 people hospitalized for COVID-19 on Wednesday — including 122 needing intensive care — was below the peak of 606 on May 28.
The rising but stable growth of COVID-19 cases in Minnesota resulted in a favorable forecast compared with the rest of the nation this week by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Washington.
IHME estimates that Minnesota as of Nov. 1 will have a rate of 5.94 active infections per 100,000 people — a rate that includes lab-confirmed infections and asymptomatic infections that aren’t detected through testing. That is the ninth-lowest predicted rate among states.
The modeling estimates that Minnesota will have suffered 1,951 COVID-19 deaths by Nov. 1 if it continues with its current, gradual scaling back of restrictions on businesses and operating capacities at bars and other public places. However, if the state imposed a mask-wearing requirement that was followed by 95% of the public, the predicted death toll would drop to 1,756.
Gov. Tim Walz expressed cautious optimism on Wednesday that Minnesota’s gradual scaling back, since the end of a statewide stay-at-home order on May 18, has insulated it somewhat from the surging case counts in states that quickly reopened.
“With that being said, I think with the re-emergence of the virus across the South, the increasing numbers, even in places like Iowa and Wisconsin, start to make us pause just a little bit,” Walz said.
The national growth in testing and cases is having local consequences. Mayo Clinic’s national reference lab in Rochester was turning around COVID-19 tests in 24 hours but is now needing 72 to 96 hours due to rising demand and new supply issues, said Dr. William Morice, president of Mayo Clinic Laboratories.
“All the testing demands nationally, really globally, are interconnected,” he said.
Mayo has been an important source of test processing for Minnesota, particularly when the state was providing free tests in Minneapolis and St. Paul to assess the spread of the virus after mass protests and riots in late May.
State health officials said they are worried that the recent increase in young adult and teenager infections could spread the virus to adults who are at higher risk due to their age or chronic health problems such as diabetes, asthma or heart disease. People 70 and older make up 11% of confirmed cases but 81% of COVID-19 deaths.
While the state has reported only two deaths from COVID-19 in people 29 or younger, one death reported on Wednesday involved a Hennepin County resident in the 30s age range with no apparent underlying medical conditions.
Ehresmann said she was particularly concerned by rumors of “COVID parties” in which young people intentionally seek infection to get COVID-19 behind them.
“This is a really, really bad idea,” she said.
Of course, regular parties without the use of masks or social distancing aren’t helping. Ehresmann said “a very large party” in late June helped fuel an outbreak among teenagers in Edina — which had only 227 cases by June 24 but has had at least 154 since then. The median age of cases in that second phase was 20.
Edina also is an anomaly with children and teens making up its largest age group of COVID-19 cases, but Ehresmann said the problem is broader than one community and includes young adults. Outbreaks at seven or eight bars in Minnesota have been linked to at least 457 cases.
“Young people from across the state are accounting for the bulk of cases in the last two weeks,” she said. “In part it’s because they’re engaging in activities that we know are so natural, so fun, and so normal for youth. But in the time of COVID, we need to make sure we’re asking people to reconsider some of those activities.”
Belated spikes in outbreaks in other states also suggest that Minnesota could still see an increase in cases related to recent changes in social and environmental conditions, said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner.
Increased virus transmission, following the June limited reopenings of restaurants and entertainment destinations, might take four or more weeks to show up compared to the initial expectations of two to three weeks, she said.
“It’s been sobering to us to realize the time window for judging the effect of things might be a bit longer,” she said.
Malcolm added that the course of the pandemic in the coming days will be influential as the state weighs how and when to reopen public schools in the fall, and whether to mandate that people wear masks to reduce transmission of the virus. Health officials are reviewing experiences in other states, she said, to see if mandates instead of strong recommendations result in actual increases in mask-wearing.
Walz also must decide whether to extend the peacetime emergency declaration, which goes through Monday, that gives him sweeping authority over the state’s pandemic response."

Tim Walz directs $12 million in federal aid to Minnesota food shelves,"More than 300 food shelves across the state will see an influx of $12 million in federal funding in response to increased demand during the coronavirus pandemic.
Gov. Tim Walz and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan announced the funding Wednesday after a tour of the Department of Indian Work in St. Paul, a food shelf that works with Native American families to provide healthy meals.
“Delivery of that food to families in normal times is difficult enough, but now in the time of COVID, one in eight of our neighbors doesn’t know where their next meal is coming from,” Walz said.
Food shelves have seen a 30% increase in visits each month since the corona­virus pandemic began, according to the state. Walz said the destruction of some grocery stores in the Twin Cities during civil unrest that followed George Floyd’s killing has made the situation more dire for some families.
Flanagan said her family relied on food shelves and food stamps when she was growing up.
“There would be times that my mom would say that she wasn’t hungry, and it wasn’t until I grew up that I realized that she just didn’t eat because there wasn’t enough food in the house,” she said. “It was really critical to our survival.”
The funding through the federal CARES Act was approved by a legislative panel and can immediately go out to food shelves and all seven food banks in the state. It’s part of $75 million total that’s been directed to state food programs since the pandemic began."

The Fairview Health Services pulmonary and critical care specialist’s voice is hoarse and she exudes exhaustion while describing caring for severely ill patients. This new strain of coronavirus has yet to settle into a predictable pattern of symptoms, behaving differently from one patient to the next. “We routinely find ourselves at a loss because what should be true isn’t,’’ said Naqvi, who wore blue scrubs as she spoke during the videoconference hearing on Wednesday. “The realization of what we do not know continues to grow.’’

Months into the COVID-19 pandemic, Naqvi’s mix of caution and humility may be unsettling, but it’s appropriate — not just inside hospitals, but in general. Dramatic case count increases in states that previously had escaped the worst of the pandemic are a reminder of how little control there is over the virus and how much there still is to learn. Important decisions, such as reopening schools and easing other restrictions, will be made with the best but likely imperfect information available at the time. Adjustments will be necessary as knowledge expands or viral behavior continues to defy understanding.

The steep learning curve means schools, if they reopen for in-person classes, may have to close again if Minnesota disease metrics take a turn for the worse. The same holds true for bars, restaurants and other organizations dependent on people gathering indoors, a known risk factor for spreading COVID-19. “We’re going to be coexisting with this virus for some time,” said Andy Slavitt, who ran the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration. Slavitt also testified at Wednesday’s hearing.

Minnesota has recently been faring better than many states, with the daily number of new cases holding relatively steady while COVID surged elsewhere, according to the New York Times COVID tracker. But the pandemic’s accelerating course in Arizona, Florida and South Carolina shows how quickly this can change.

The three had previously been relatively unscathed as COVID hit New York hard earlier this year. Now, according to the New York Times, these Sun Belt states have the “world’s worst outbreaks.” The ranking system looked at each U.S. state and compared it internationally for case growth, adjusted for population. Arizona, Florida and South Carolina are ranked 1, 2 and 3, with Bahrain at 4.

For perspective, consider that as recently as June 9, Arizona had fewer cases than Minnesota, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s COVID tracker. But as of early Friday, Arizona had reported 112,671 confirmed cases, while Minnesota had 40,201.

Some might question whether more testing is responsible for the three states’ case growth. The reality: The states are testing more, but the percentage of positive tests, along with rising hospitalizations and deaths, indicates increased spread.

Slavitt brought a welcome note of optimism to Wednesday’s hearing, saying that social distancing and other mitigation measures have given scientists valuable time to study the virus and develop treatments. But there’s still a long way to go.

Expectations about returning to normal should be adjusted accordingly. This will likely happen in fits and starts, as occurred during the 1918 influenza pandemic. The only thing certain at this time is that we will have to learn to live with uncertainty and adjust as necessary in the months ahead."
"July 11, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/china-s-stock-market-is-popular-again-and-investors-wonder-how-long-this-bull-will-run/571699872/,StarTribune,"China's stock market is popular again, and investors wonder how long this bull will run","In Chinese stock market mythology, the rarest of beasts is the slow bull.
The past couple of decades have brought two fast bulls: vertiginous surges in share prices, neither lasting more than a year.
Those soon led to fast bears when stocks crashed and, eventually, to slow bears as the descent became more gradual. Most of the time there have been what might be termed long worms as the market moved sideways, such that the CSI 300 index, a gauge of China’s biggest stocks, has averaged the same level over the past five years that it first reached back in 2007.
The slow bull — a steady, almost dependable, rise year after year, well known to investors in the United States — has remained elusive.
China’s indomitable investors now hope that a trundling bull has at last arrived.
Stocks have jumped by 16% so far in July and they are up by nearly 40% from their low in March. That might sound like another fast, doomed bull run. But some believe this one will be more enduring than those of the past. For starters, China appears to be in much better economic shape than other large economies.
Because investors must allocate their funds somewhere, there is always a comparative element to stock market performance.
China is the only big economy forecast to grow this year, and is also expected to record the strongest rebound next year, according to projections published by the IMF at the end of June. There are grave concerns about the toll that the coronavirus might take in America during the flu season in the autumn. By contrast, China has shown every intention of smothering renewed outbreaks. That has given people and businesses greater certainty about the path ahead.
Market dynamics also seem to be helping. Even after the rally, valuations in China are reasonable. The CSI 300 trades at 14 times the value of company earnings, far below the 27-times multiple of the S&P 500, the most-watched U.S. share index.
Foreign investors have more ways to enter China’s previously walled-off market; many are compelled to do so, because its shares are now included in key indexes tracked by institutions. During the first three trading days of July, 44 billion yuan ($6 billion) flowed into Chinese equities via accounts in Hong Kong, a record high for any three-day period.
Although more investors have started buying shares with borrowed money, the outstanding balance of such margin trading is just over half the peak it reached five years ago, during China’s most recent manic run.
It is now easier for companies to list shares on the mainland, so new offerings should help absorb some of the cash rushing into the stock market.
“This lays the foundation for a slow-bull market that could last for 10 or 20 years,” says Chang Shishan of Kangzhuang, an asset-management firm.
Nevertheless, it is hard to shake the feeling that the optimists might once again be getting ahead of themselves. The outlook for profitability, which ultimately should determine share prices, is still grim. Over the first five months of 2020, industrial profits were down by 19% compared with a year earlier.
Most worrying is the way that the Chinese media are swinging into cheerleading mode. If past episodes are anything to go by, this is one of the telltale signs of irrational exuberance.
“The clicking of the bull’s hooves is a beautiful sound for our post-virus era,” declared a front-page editorial in the China Securities Journal, a state-run newspaper, on July 6. The Shanghai Securities, its sister publication, was less poetic but more direct in an article that was posted online on July 3: “Hahahahaha! It looks more and more like a bull market!”
Healthy bulls need only a diet of grass. Injecting them with steroids is an invitation to trouble."
"July 11, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/longtime-public-health-official-helps-coordinate-minnesota-s-covid-19-fight/571730632/,StarTribune,Longtime public health official helps coordinate Minnesota's COVID-19 fight,"For more than two decades in many roles at the Minnesota Health Department, Kris Ehresmann has been preparing for a devastating pandemic.
As a member of the infectious disease division and now its leader, she has helped the state agency respond to outbreaks that claimed many lives worldwide — swine flu, SARS and MERS, as well as two coronaviruses.
But in February, Ehresmann immediately recognized that COVID-19, another new corona­virus, would likely require the type of public health response that hadn’t been mounted in 100 years.
“We certainly have been talking about this forever,” she said recently. “I realized it was going to be different, but I don’t think I fully comprehended how different it would be.”
Ehresmann is among a core group advising Gov. Tim Walz on the state’s response to the insidious virus, which has fundamentally altered the social and economic fabric of Minnesota since it was first detected here in early March.
Although COVID-19 ebbed somewhat during June, Ehresmann is concerned about the increase in cases among younger adults.
“This disease continues to surprise us in unfortunate ways,” she said. “It is a stark reminder that COVID-19 is not only a disease of old age.”
The new coronavirus could also be setting the stage for other public health setbacks, she has warned. With fewer children receiving vaccines, there could be a spike in preventable diseases. And emergency room use is also down, including for heart attacks and strokes — a sign that people are not seeking care.
“What we are seeing with the data is really concerning,” Ehresmann said. “It could contribute to excess mortality.”
Ehresmann’s experience at MDH runs deep. First hired as a student worker in 1989, she has held many of the job titles that she now oversees.
“She has led outbreak investigations for many years and one could say that she has been preparing for this outbreak her whole career,” said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, the state epidemiologist and medical adviser at MDH who works closely with Ehresmann.
COVID-19 has consumed Ehresmann’s life, often leading to seven-day workweeks that start at 6:30 a.m. As her husband, who also works at the agency, drives them to MDH headquarters in St. Paul, Ehresmann responds to e-mails.
“If I can’t get my act together between 7 and 8:45 I am in trouble because there are usually meetings scheduled through the rest of the day,” she said.
She is no stranger to crises. As director of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Prevention and Control Division, she oversees a department of 200 employees that deals with outbreaks of all types, whether they originate in food, water, animals or human contact.
“We have this every day all the time,” she said. “We are constantly dealing with outbreaks.”
In the past few years, there have been outbreaks of measles, drug-resistant tuberculosis, Legionnaires’ disease, syphilis, hepatitis and the perennial flu. Her staff also investigates when people get sick from contaminated food and water or get bitten by mosquitoes and ticks that carry diseases.
Ehresmann credits the work of her team who handles the investigations and prevention efforts, one reason MDH has earned a national reputation for public health.
Her employees say she is an effective leader.
“She has a very diverse background,” said Dr. Aaron DeVries, who worked as Ehresmann’s medical director until 2015. “You have to have this wide breadth of expertise in order to manage” such a large division.
Life-changing trip
The daughter of a father who was a dentist, Ehresmann, 58, grew up in Bloomington. Her mother trained as a nurse but could not get hired as one after she married — a prohibition that was common many decades ago.
Following in her mother’s footsteps, Ehresmann initially studied to be a nurse while at St. Olaf College in Northfield.
“I didn’t even know the word epidemiology when I was an undergrad,” she said.
She spent a semester working at a rural health clinic in India and saw how poverty can affect health.
“For a white girl from the suburbs who had a very comfortable life, it was eye-opening, and I didn’t think I could be the same after that.”
The clinic in India ran a program to give tetanus vaccines to pregnant women so they would not pass it on to their kids.
“The idea of how could you make a difference in a community, that was fascinating to me,” Ehresmann said.
After graduating from college, Ehresmann initially couldn’t get a job due to a nurses’ strike. Eventually she landed work involving surgical, cardiac and critical care. She still holds an active nursing license.
She started graduate work at the University of Minnesota with the idea of becoming a health educator.
David Snowdon, a noted epidemiologist who led the often-cited Nun Study of aging and Alzheimer’s disease, persuaded her to take a different path.
“He talked me into going into epidemiology and I have never regretted it,” she said. “It was the perfect mix for me.”
Michael Osterholm, the University of Minnesota infectious disease expert, hired Ehresmann as a student worker in 1989 when he was an MDH epidemiology official.
“From the very first time I met Kris it was clear that she had a passion for public health and infectious diseases,” he said. “So from that standpoint she clearly stood out from the crowd.”
Osterholm says Ehresmann has the organizational and leadership skills to bring people together. Those are important for managing a bureaucracy, but they are also necessary when talking to the public.
So much of public health relies on getting voluntary compliance to health recommendations, he said, whether it be vaccinations or social distancing.
“How you educate the public is really a very critical issue,” he said. “The public has to see themselves as partners in that communication, not students. Kris understands that.”
A new renown
Ehresmann has always been front and center for MDH’s communication efforts during most significant outbreaks. With COVID-19, the department has taken the unprecedented step of holding daily 2 p.m. media briefings. She often joins Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm, as well as Walz and other agency heads in explaining the data and trends and answering questions.
Although the briefing schedule has been cut back recently, Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets often stream the audio or video, giving the infectious disease director a new prominence.
Ehresmann has been recognized while walking her dog and while visiting her new home. (The change of residence was based on a decision last fall to downsize, but moving during a pandemic was not easy — inducing “some moments of total sheer panic and meltdown.”)
“Everyone has been super gracious and kind,” Ehresmann said. “Even if they have not agreed with the decisions, they have been very kind to me.”
But Ehresmann avoids any media coverage of herself, joking that it might make her reluctant to make future appearances.
“I’ve been doing this for a long time, and I never watch or listen to myself,” she said.
In the midst of the pandemic, Ehresmann has foregone the travel that she and her husband enjoyed, and the charity bicycle rides. She escapes through her devotion to her two adult children, British television mysteries and reading all types of books.
Sometimes, she will use a sleeping aid to make sure she gets her rest.
“If I wake up and start thinking about work, I can’t go back to sleep,” she said.
Despite her heavy workload, Ehresmann has no plans to jump ship to the corporate world or even to leave the state, preferring instead to keep the ties that she has, including going to a cabin that has been in her family nearly 100 years.
“Working in the private sector just never occurred to me,” she said. “I am very much public service; that is how I have been hard-wired.”"
"July 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/return-to-work-covid-antibody-testing-comes-with-warning/571736682/,StarTribune,Return to work' COVID antibody testing comes with warning,"Doctors say employers should not use COVID-19 antibody tests to decide whether employees are safe to return to work, yet such testing is being promoted by lab companies and hospitals to businesses through “back to work” programs.
The idea is tantalizing: If scientists knew a COVID-19 infection caused the body to produce antibodies that reliably protect against re-infection, determining who’s safe to return to work could be as simple as a well-designed blood test.
Yet the American Medical Association, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Minnesota Department of Health each say the evidence backing test accuracy and protectiveness from antibodies is not yet strong enough. Even the lab companies and hospitals admit they can’t offer “immunity certificates” to people who have the antibodies today.
“We don’t know what level of antibodies makes someone immune to COVID-19. All we can tell is that the person has been exposed,” said Dr. Susan Bailey, a Texas allergist and immunologist who is president of the American Medical Association. “We don’t necessarily know what that immune response means, in terms of someone’s ability to go back to work or to school.”
National lab companies like Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, as well as Minnesota health care providers such as HealthPartners in Bloomington, North Memorial Health in Robbinsdale and Mayo Clinic in Rochester, are all offering antibody tests as part of a suite of “return to work” and “stay at work” offerings.
Those organizations say any decision to use antibody testing in a workforce is based on individual factors, such as which industry is involved, the proximity of workers to other people, and the overall exposure level to COVID-19 in a community.
Antibody tests are typically used together with diagnostic testing to give a fuller picture of a person’s infection status. Specimens can be drawn at work, at a clinic or elsewhere.
“We would consult with our lab experts and our occupational medicine experts and ensure that we’re using the best evidence ... to make the recommendations that support what they’re needing to accomplish for the business,” said Dr. Kevin Ronneberg, associate medical director overseeing health initiatives like the “Back to Business” testing program at HealthPartners.
HealthPartners says all samples that test positive for COVID-19 antibodies are run through a second instrument from a different company, per federal recommendations, leading to what the system said is a 99.9% positive predictive value for the IgG antibody.
But testing accuracy can’t make up for the fact that researchers don’t know yet whether antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are totally protective, how long they last, or why some people don’t produce them after having COVID-19.
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was discovered late last year in China. Although antibodies to past respiratory syndromes like SARS and MERS last a year or more, a study of 37 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in China reported last month that antibodies to the new coronavirus declined within three months of initial infection, study authors wrote in Nature Medicine.
A second study, not yet peer reviewed, examined antibodies in 5,300 Chinese health care workers and COVID-19 patients and concluded last month that “people are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.”
Antibody blood tests are one of the two kinds of COVID-19 screens people will encounter at work. The other kind is “molecular” PCR testing, using nasal or throat swabs. PCR tests are the only tools that can diagnose active cases and have prompted long lines in cities with outbreaks.
On Sunday, PCR testing confirmed 715 new cases of COVID-19 in Minnesota, bringing the state’s tally to 42,281 since March 5. The Minnesota Department of Health also reported three new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the state’s tally to 1,502. Nationally, nearly 135,000 have died.
But the death toll from COVID-19 has not stopped even high-contagion businesses such as meatpacking plants, hair salons and bars from reopening.
And last week, 64% of Minnesota parents in an informal online survey with 130,000 responses said they would feel comfortable sending their students into school buildings in the fall.
Dr. William Morice, an immunologist and blood disorder doctor who is president of Mayo Clinic Laboratories, said antibody testing can be useful in workplace settings, despite the drawbacks and caveats.
“It gives you a sense for how much of your workforce has been exposed to the virus, and we know there is some level of protective immunity from that — we don’t know how much,” Morice said.
The first company to sign up for Mayo Clinic Laboratories’ comprehensive antibody and PCR testing services is Delta Air Lines, which is testing its entire workforce.
North Memorial Health started working directly with smaller and midsize companies last month. A spokeswoman said employers make their own decisions about what screening to do and what value it offers. North Memorial recommends employers in its testing program screen their employees every 14 days.
HealthPartners’ “Back to Business” program has signed up about 20 employers as clients from among 200 initial inquiries since mid-May. Clients include retail and manufacturing businesses and public entities like cities and school districts. The system’s laboratory experts and occupational-medicine doctors are consulted to ensure the best evidence is used.
“As you know, that is changing frequently,” Ronnenberg said last week, adding that test usage “will be determined based on business needs and the best available medical evidence.”
Though employees are often provided the results of their work-sponsored antibody testing, AMA President Bailey said people should talk to their doctors about understanding the results.
Testing “needs to be done taking that person’s individual case into account and looking at the total picture of their health,” Bailey said. “And I would caution against the validity of any kind of immunity certificate that was given at this point in time.”"
"July 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/face-masks-remain-symbol-of-division-as-gov-tim-walz-mulls-mandate/571736462/,StarTribune,Face masks remain symbol of division as Gov. Tim Walz considers mandate,"The partisan divide was apparent on the face of every Minnesota lawmaker gathered for the private meeting at the State Capitol in June.
It was the closing hours of the last special session and the group of dealmakers remained at odds on the intricacies of police reform. But before negotiations even began, there was a stark contrast: Every Democrat entered the room with a face covering; but not one Republican wore a mask.
The face mask — a basic item health officials consider a simple precaution against the spread of COVID-19 — has become a symbol of political division across the state and the nation.
Now, as Gov. Tim Walz mulls a statewide mask mandate, state and local government leaders are weighing their response. A decision could come in a matter of days, as state lawmakers return to St. Paul for another special session to consider his emergency powers.
“It’s another symptom of the political polarization that we have. The moment Trump said he didn’t want to wear a mask it became a big deal,” said Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington, referring to President Donald Trump’s reluctance to wear a face covering. “A statewide mandate will probably encourage some people to wear a mask, but other people are going to ignore it,” added Garofalo, who has donned a mask at the Capitol.
On Saturday, the president publicly wore a mask for the first time during a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, D.C.
As COVID-19 cases have spiked elsewhere in the U.S., mask wearing has shot to a record high. A national Gallup poll from late June found 86% of adults reported using one in the previous week. That’s up from 51% in April.
If Walz does opt for a mandate, Minnesota would join Democratic and Republican governors of more than 20 other states that have required masks in public. In Minnesota, a number of cities from Minneapolis to Winona have already enacted local requirements.
But there is resistance to a statewide mandate.
Lake of the Woods County Commissioner Cody Hasbargen said he doesn’t want to see a one-size-fits-all mandate for masks. His county is the only one in the state where there has yet to be a confirmed case of COVID-19 as of Friday afternoon.
“Greater Minnesota is different than the cities, and it would be nice to have the ability to adapt something like that,” he said. It’s unclear how Walz would apply or enforce a mandate, and Hasbargen said enforcement would be challenging in spread-out communities like his.
Mask use in the State Capitol has tended to follow party lines, though people’s reasons for or against it vary widely. Several lawmakers say that in their home districts, people’s living circumstances, age and health seem to guide usage as much as political beliefs.
For state Rep. Jeremy Munson, R-Lake Crystal, a state mandate would not change his decision not to wear a mask. At a recent groundbreaking event, he showed up without a mask. When one was offered, he refused it. Munson said a photo from the event captures everyone else — including City Council members and Republican Sen. Julie Rosen — in masks, while his face is bare.
“I just haven’t seen a need for it,” said Munson, maintaining that his focus is on washing his hands and social distancing. While he supports individuals making their own mask decisions, Munson said he is worried people will stop distancing as much with them. “It gives people a large sense of false security,” he said.
Rep. Carlos Mariani, DFL-St. Paul, said he feels uncomfortable around people who don’t wear masks. He was in the room during the talks on police reform during which Democrats were masked and Republicans weren’t. At one point, a Republican colleague told him it was hard to hear him through his mask.
Mariani said he chose not to debate the legislator. But he said if he had, “I would have replied, ‘I care enough about your life and my life to wear one.’ It’s as simple as that.”
Some Democrats have criticized their GOP counterparts’ unwillingness to wear face masks. During that particular closed-door negotiation session in June, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, noted that Republicans were anticipating a smaller crowd.
Gazelka said he tries to be socially distant, but has not worn a mask at the Capitol and generally prefers not to use them. He said he complies if businesses like Menards or Costco require masks. He wore one during a tour in Minneapolis to work with local leaders on the response to the civil unrest that followed the police killing of George Floyd.
Still, Gazelka opposes the idea of a statewide mandate and said he believes it would hurt Walz politically.
“People are tired of ... being micromanaged,” Gazelka said. “It’s a sense of controlling your own destiny.”
For Republicans, a national leadership anxious to reopen the economy has offered mixed messages on masks.
Trump had not been wearing masks in public before Saturday, and masks were uncommon among attendees at his July 4th weekend events and at a recent rally in Oklahoma. But he has softened his tone in recent days, saying masks are good and that he has worn them.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said wearing a mask is the most important action Americans can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, meanwhile, has said he would make mask-wearing mandatory in public. He tweeted on July 4th that “one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask.”
Guidance around masks has evolved since the coronavirus first hit the U.S. Health officials initially urged people to stop stocking up on masks, saying they should be reserved for health professionals facing shortages of protective equipment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance as it learned more about the spread of the virus and now instructs people to wear a cloth face covering in public, especially if social distancing is difficult.
The Walz administration is encouraging people to follow the guidelines with a #MaskUpMN social media campaign and have said they plan to do a paid advertising campaign as well.
The divide is also being felt in the fall campaigns that will determine every seat in the Legislature.
The state DFL Party has advised candidates and campaign staff to make calls rather than knock on doors this election season. Heather Keeler, a Democrat running for retiring Rep. Ben Lien’s Moorhead seat, is following that advice. She said that while traditional face-to-face contact is “where it’s at” on the campaign trail, her community’s health is more important.
She backs a mask mandate, noting that the widespread use of masks in some countries appears to have helped control the virus’ spread.
One of the hardest things about campaigning now is knowing how to approach people and comfortably interact with them, said Republican candidate John Burkel, who hopes to represent retiring Rep. Dan Fabian’s district in the far northwest corner of the state. He hasn’t done much door knocking but does speak to small groups and carries a mask in case people want him to wear it.
The idea of a mandate frustrates people in “rocks and cows country,” where Burkel joked that people socially distance by default.
“People just want to be able to be smart on their own and be safe. ... They know how to do it up there,” he said. “There’s a balance here that can be struck, and I don’t think mandates really speak to balance.”"
"July 13, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/what-s-trump-s-case-for-a-second-term-he-struggles-to-answer/571743302/,StarTribune,What's Trump's case for a second term? He struggles to answer,"Three times in the last month, President Donald Trump has been asked the most basic question for every president seeking re-election: If voters give you a second term, what will you do with it?
Each time, Trump has struggled to come up with an answer.
When Sean Hannity of Fox News asked Trump to list his priorities, the president couldn’t think of any.
“One of the things that will be really great — you know, the word ‘experience’ is still good,” he said. “I always say talent is more important than experience. I’ve always said that. But the word ‘experience’ is a very important word. It’s a very important meaning.”
It went downhill from there. Trump disclosed that he had visited Washington multiple times but had never slept over until “all of a sudden” he became president. Also, he didn’t know many people here because he’s from New York, but now he knows “everybody” in Washington.
A few days later, another friendly interviewer, Eric Bolling of Sinclair Broadcasting, politely offered a do-over: What will be your focus if voters give you another term?
Trump’s second try was only a little better than the first.
“It’s very simple,” he said. “We’re going to make America great again. We’ve rebuilt the military; we have a ways to go. We’ve done things for the vets like nobody’s ever seen. We can do even more.”
“Economic development, jobs, trade deals,” he added. “We’ve got to bring back manufacturing. We want to build our own ships. So we have a lot of things we can do.”
So, a handful of broad targets — military spending, “things for the vets,” trade deals, manufacturing jobs and ships — but no sign of a program or plan.
In a third interview, with the Wall Street Journal, Trump opted for just one priority.
“It’s really building a strong, powerful economy,” he said.
But again he offered nothing specific — no proposal for how he’d bring the coronavirus-stricken economy back to life and restore the tens of millions of jobs lost since March.
Even some Republicans winced.
“What would Trump do with a second term?” asked Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review. “At the moment, not only does no voter know the answer to that question; Trump himself has no idea.”
Every presidential candidate bungles an interview now and then. But no incumbent has ever whiffed the key question — why are you running? — three times in a row.
So Trump wasn’t just having a bad day. When it comes to policy, he really doesn’t know what he’d do in a second four years. He’s out of ideas, and his staff hasn’t produced any new ones he’d bother to mention.
Yes, he’d like to make the economy stronger — but that’s not a plan.
And yes, he’d keep trying to Make America Great Again — but that’s a slogan on a baseball cap, not a program for governing.
It’s not unprecedented for an incumbent to run without a detailed second-term plan. Ronald Reagan did it in 1984, when his campaign theme was the gauzy “Morning in America.” It was a time of economic recovery and national optimism, and Reagan won in a landslide.
That appears to have been Trump’s plan, too. But with the coronavirus crisis spiraling out of control and the economy staggering, he doesn’t have a Plan B. Rather than provide leadership in the battle against the pandemic, he complains that it has hurt his campaign.
Trump has never shown much interest in the details of governing. His 2016 candidacy and the presidency that followed have been about attitude, not policy.
His first campaign didn’t propose detailed policy goals until 17 days before the election. His current campaign website doesn’t even have an “issues” page; it merely displays a list of actions the White House says Trump has taken.
As president, his central focus was to dethrone the political establishment in both parties and represent his mostly white supporters, the people he calls “the forgotten men and women of our country” in the Culture War. He left legislation to his conservative allies in Congress.
But there may be a second, more surprising reason Trump has run out of ideas: He’s already accomplished most of what he set out to do.
The core of his first-term agenda consisted of five big items: corporate tax cuts, deregulation, a crackdown on immigration, new trade deals and repealing Obamacare. He accomplished the first three, made headway on the fourth and failed on the fifth — not bad for a rookie.
No wonder he’s aggrieved that the coronavirus has robbed him of the credit he thinks he deserves.
So here’s a friendly proposal for the president: Declare victory and retire. He can tell his supporters he’s done most of what he came to Washington to do.
He can turn the Republican nomination over to the successor of his choice — Mike Pence, Jared Kushner or Don Jr. — with instructions to finish the job.
Best of all for a man who loathes being a loser, he can ensure that his record in elections remains forever perfect: one win, no losses."

Tim Walz's emergency powers during pandemic,"Minnesota lawmakers returned to the State Capitol on Monday hoping to resolve continuing partisan differences on police accountability, a major public works package and several tax and spending measures.
But first they faced off over Gov. Tim Walz’s decision to extend his emergency powers for another 30 days to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, a move that prompted the second legislative session of the summer, just four months ahead of the November elections.
As expected, the Republican-led Senate quickly passed a resolution to rescind the DFL governor’s emergency powers, which have become entangled in negotiations over police reform and a massive infrastructure borrowing package. The vote was 36-31, with only one lawmaker, DFL Sen. Kent Eken, DFL-Twin Valley, crossing party lines.
The DFL-controlled House is unlikely to follow suit, leaving Walz’s pandemic decrees intact at least through the middle of August.
Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman said she believes the governor’s emergency powers are critical as COVID-19 cases rise nationally, a trend that has prompted intensifying national debates about face masks and opening schools in the fall.
Minnesota Republicans argued that even as the pandemic continues, the state of emergency passed.
“The emergency part of the pandemic is over,” said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, contending that the state acted quickly during the onset of the virus and now has the needed precautions in place.
But Hortman pointed to the spike in Southern states like Texas, where refrigerated trucks are needed to store bodies because morgues are at capacity. “We have to very seriously consider what it could be in the future for Minnesotans,” she said. “So the emergency is in no respects over.”
Walz characterized the COVID-19 pandemic as an evolving emergency.
“The peacetime emergency has provided us tools to save lives and mitigate the devastating impacts of this pandemic,” he said in a statement Monday extending his emergency powers. “As cases skyrocket in other states, we can’t let our guard down now.”
Every state but Wisconsin has some type of ongoing emergency order to deal with COVID-19, according to National Governors Association data from July 1.
The disagreement over emergency powers continues to threaten action on the infrastructure financing package known as the bonding bill. Long-term state borrowing requires supermajorities in both chambers to pass. GOP House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt has said his caucus will withhold its support for the bonding bill unless Walz relinquishes his emergency powers. That has put him at odds with both Gazelka and Hortman, who say the two issues should not be linked.
Hortman said she pressed Daudt again on the bonding bill Monday morning, but added, “I don’t think he’s there yet.” Daudt made no public comment on the bill Monday.
Legislators are considering more than $1.8 billion in borrowing and spending to support state and local repair and improvement projects, Hortman said. That includes $1.35 billion in general obligation bonds, $300 million in highway bonds, $147 million in appropriation bonds — $100 million of which would be used for housing — and another $38 million in cash.
Bonding discussions also are tied to deal for a GOP tax relief bill for farmers and businesses, as well as to a $58 million spending package that includes some of Democrats’ supplemental spending priorities.
While legislative leaders said they are close to a deal on bonding, they remain deep in negotiations over police reforms. Lawmakers on both sides proposed a slate of police accountability measures following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd on May 25, an incident that sparked global protests and a national examination of race and social justice.
While a special session in June failed to produce any agreement, lawmakers on both sides said they are still talking, though largely out of public view.
“We have not stopped working on that since the end of last special session,” Gazelka said. “It feels like there’s real progress that has been happening there.”
Among the more contentious proposals are new statewide use-of-force regulations, a plan to spend $15 million on alternatives to policing, new arbitration rules for officers facing dismissal, and reforms to the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training. Both Hortman and Gazelka declined to specify particular areas where they have made progress or struck agreements since the last special session ended on June 20.
Gazelka said legislative leaders will continue closed-door negotiations, with the full Senate not planning to reconvene until Wednesday or next Monday, depending on action in the House. Meanwhile, House Democrats planned to advance police reform and bonding proposals in the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday.
Discussions of Walz’s emergency powers Monday often centered on reopening Minnesota schools in the next school year. Walz has said he will make a decision about schools on July 27. Republican senators said they want schools to reopen and allow local school boards and administrators to make decisions about how to manage COVID-19.
“Some members seem to think that one person has somehow the ability to understand what 300 school districts face,” Sen. Carla Nelson, R-Rochester, said.
Democrats also expressed a desire to open schools. “But we have to do it a way that’s safe,” said Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, DFL-Woodbury, noting that the needed precautions could be expensive and complicated."
"July 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/border-ban-keeps-minnesotans-from-their-canadian-getaways/571760632/,StarTribune,Minnesotans pining for Canada getaways amid travel ban,"Chris Causey can only reminisce these days about the walleye fishing, swimming and paddleboarding that he and his St. Paul family are now missing on their 22 acres on a Rainy Lake island, where Canada’s summertime twilight fades long and slow into the night.
“I consider it heaven on Earth,” Causey said last week. “It’s the most beautiful place in the world.”
But for months, he and other Minnesotans have been barred from their soul-nurturing Canadian lakeside retreats during the nation’s prohibition on American visitors to thwart the spread of coronavirus, and their lament and resignation continue to grow with the passing season.
Canada’s ban on discretionary crossings by Americans began March 21 as part of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s mission to send the highly contagious virus into further retreat.
It since has been renewed monthly through July 21, with no indication that many members of Congress from Minnesota and other northern states will prevail in lobbying to have it loosened or lifted altogether amid the troubling surge of infections in several parts of the United States. Add to that a recent poll of Canadians showing overwhelming support for telling leisure-seeking Americans: Stay out.
Amid growing media reports that another month will be tacked on, Trudeau said Monday at a news conference that border discussions “are ongoing” with the United States, and “we will have more to say later this week, I’m sure.”
Essential crossings along the world’s longest border between two nations are allowed for workers such as health care professionals, airline crews and truck drivers moving food and medical goods in both directions.
Upon entry, whether showing symptoms of COVID-19 or not, arrivals must go directly to their destination and quarantine for 14 days. However, someone who crosses on a regular basis for nondiscretionary reasons, such as a medical worker or a truck driver, would likely not be subject to quarantine requirements.
Tourism, recreation and entertainment are deemed nonessential for one nation’s citizens to enter the other’s by land, sea, air or rail. And that includes to a vacation home.
“For secondary property, for that kind of travel, it is deemed nonessential,” Ariel Delouya, consul general of Canada in Minneapolis, said Tuesday afternoon. “We understand, obviously, the frustration this causes ... in implementing this policy. It is really about mitigating this disease.”
As for when a decision on the fate of the travel ban would be made, Delouya said, “My guess is we’ll probably hear something by the weekend.”
‘Untenable for communities’
Causey describes the westward view from his “off the grid” hideaway roughly 13 crow-flying miles north of the U.S.-Canada border as “vast water and myriad islands.”
His closest neighbor is at least a mile away. He said he and the others stay in touch on marine radio “sharing pie recipes, fishing stories, seeking clarification on cribbage rules and complaining about the weather.”
As Canada’s entry ban stays locked in place, the 57-year-old husband and empty-nest father of three keeps tabs on his property from 500 miles away. He has someone on the island check every couple of weeks on his cabin, adjacent cottage and other structures. He was last there in March, just before the travel curtain fell.
“Between the mice, brown squirrels and the black bears, there will be consequence for land owners who are not able to tend to their property,” said Causey, who estimated that typically he’s on the island about a third of the time from mid-May to mid-October.
“I just can’t allow myself to obsess over what is out of my control,” he said. “As sad as I am, I care more about the people who live in those [Canadian] communities and protecting them.”
Brian Higgins of Wayzata is spending the summer far from his four-season place along 100 feet of lakeshore between Lake of the Woods to the west and Rainy Lake to the east.
“I guess I’ll go fish on Lake Minnetonka,” rather than on Ontario’s Clearwater Lake, said Higgins, now that he’s bought his first Minnesota fishing license in 13 years.
Higgins spelled out his case in a letter as a constituent to U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips to be allowed back into Canada so he can at least put away the snowmobiles, mow the lawn and see what might be spoiled in the fridge.
The Democrat responded to Higgins that “restricting the ability of U.S. citizens that own homes ... north of the Canadian border to visit and manage those properties hurts not only their economic vitality, but also that of the hospitality and tourism industries in those areas.”
Phillips’ reply went on to say his staff is in contact with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “and will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to expediently resolve this issue.”
U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, whose district runs along the eastern half of the Minnesota-Canada border, has been lobbying leadership in both nations for the crossing limitations to be eased.
The Duluth Republican is among more than two dozen House members in both parties who sent a letter last week to acting DHS Commissioner Chad Wolf and his counterpart in Canada, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair, pushing for the border’s reopening.
“Continuing to extend border restrictions at 30-day intervals is untenable for the communities that have been separated from family and unable to tend to their property for over three months,” the letter from Stauber and his colleagues read. “We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border … in order to restore the social bond that unites our two nations.”
Katherine Cuplinskas, spokeswoman for the Canadian emergency preparedness minister, declined in an e-mail exchange late last week to address the fate of the travel ban but pointed out, “Our absolute priority is the health and safety of Canadians. That is why we want to be clear that decisions about Canada’s border are made by Canadians, for Canadians.”
Collin Cook of Minneapolis sympathizes with Canada’s desire not to make fending off the virus any more difficult than it already is.
“I totally understand from the Canadian perspective,” said Cook, whose family has 1¼ acres on Rainy Lake’s Red Gut Bay. “They have a much lower caseload than we do.”
This summer, Cook opted to go with his wife and their 7- and 5-year-old daughters to Lost Lake, just west of Eagle River in northern Wisconsin.
“The girls have been doing quite a bit of picking apart what they don’t like about this place” compared to their usual Canadian retreat, the 44-year-old data consultant said. “They want their bunk beds.”
The rate of new coronavirus infections continues to plummet in Canada, which has recorded more than 108,000 cases of coronavirus and nearly 8,800 deaths. New cases peaked at 2,760 on May 3 to a low of 221 on Saturday.
In contrast, total coronavirus infections in the United States has surged past 3 million. Deaths in the U.S. are climbing sharply as well, now topping 135,000.
“When Canadians see the video of crowded beaches and bars in the U.S., I don’t blame them for looking at us with dismay,” said Causey, the part-time Rainy Lake island inhabitant. “They’re thinking, ‘Hey, we love you guys, but we’ll wait for you until this thing passes.’
“As much as I want to be there and now mourn the loss of this season, I completely understand. … They’re hunkering down and being really smart about it.”"
"July 14, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/stock-market-rising-on-the-indispensable-companies/571707992/,StarTribune,Stock market rising on the indispensable companies,"The boomers and Xers remember when Microsoft was so dominant that a federal judge ordered it broken up.
That year of peak Microsoft was 2000, the tail end of the dot-com boom. While the company stayed in one piece and moved on, 10 years later its stock price was nowhere near its peak. It became easy to never think of Microsoft except maybe when upgrading to the new Office software suite.
But, of course, peak Microsoft really came last week.
It’s also the era of peak Apple, peak Amazon.com and peak Netflix.
These companies are worth so much in the stock market now that their big year has become one explanation for a booming stock market rally since March, when a sharp downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic reversed course.
This might not be a stock market story, either, explained away by factors like bored sports bettors looking for a new way to squander their money. Maybe instead we are seeing more value in companies that provide the stuff that turned out to be essential as the COVID-19 pandemic rolls on, and maybe even well after it winds down.
Microsoft often seems surprising on a list of high-flyers, because it must be well into its sleepy, late middle age by now, right? It has been a quarter-century since release of its groundbreaking Windows 95 operating system for personal computers.
After months of ignoring news of its resurgence, it took less than an hour of reading to see it’s a genuine powerhouse. It provides an array of software and services that form part of the basic foundation for business, stepping into the kind of role once played by International Business Machines Corp.
Microsoft reported revenue of about $35 billion in its last quarter, up 15% from the prior year’s quarter, with an operating margin of better than 37%. It generated cash flow from operations in just those three months of $17.5 billion.
Microsoft has been battling for top spot among America’s most valuable companies with Amazon and Apple. Yet because of the structure of its ownership, Microsoft is the biggest factor now in how well the S&P 500 performs and thus our perception of the “stock market.”
The S&P 500 is a weighted index, so the relative value of the components matters a lot. The heavyweight champ Microsoft outweighs the top 10 Minnesota-based companies, combined as a group, by more than two to one.
Take a Minnesota blue-chipper like Target, a corporate stalwart that’s a big part of the state’s economy. Microsoft has more than 25 times the impact of Target in the S&P 500. Microsoft shares go up in price 5%, and that could be enough to make it a good day in the stock market. Target stock goes up 5% and the needle may not budge.
Valuable, not overvalued
This isn’t just a Microsoft story, either. Microsoft stock’s strong appreciation this year has trailed Netflix and Amazon. As of last week, just six big technology companies now make up about a quarter of the S&P 500.
These big technology companies are still not wildly overvalued, at least according to strategist Jim Paulsen from the Minneapolis-based Leuthold Group, nothing like technology firms were during the frenzied speculation that powered Microsoft (and even a few comically speculative startups) to new highs 20 years ago.
Moreover, he explained, the professional investors are buying them now because they appear safer to own in a really stressful time, kind of like how fund managers bought the stock of utilities or food companies in an earlier era. As he put it, “The rally in tech and new-era is being driven at least in part by bearishness and fear.”
What made those old-fashioned “defensive” companies attractive in a sinking economy is that their businesses held up better because nobody voluntarily cut off their own electric power or quit buying groceries. These things are indispensable.
And that’s the word that Gene Munster, analyst and co-founder of venture firm Loup Ventures in Minneapolis, used to describe the “tools and products” that companies like Microsoft and Apple now sell.
You may not love these companies, their market dominance and hubris, but they do really deliver. Social isolation and working from home made Apple’s iPhones and iPads as important as a working refrigerator. Need a computer mouse right away because a teenager borrowed one that then went missing? Try Amazon.com.
There are competitors in streaming video including Apple and Walt Disney Co., but Netflix is the can’t-miss place for entertainment this year.
Last weekend our family used Netflix to watch a new movie about a comically bad Icelandic musical duo. The movie was fine, but what made this a memorable evening was how five family members could watch one movie together, chatting away, from four different living rooms.
I don’t know how much Netflix would have to raise its price to get me to cancel.
What’s essential?
Facebook has been another strong performer of late, yet Munster called it “an outlier” to his notion of the top firms providing essential services.
He’s not referring to the swelling controversy over Facebook’s content algorithms and hate speech. He just can’t easily see what its next big opportunity is.
These big technology companies have likely become too important for regulators to ignore, and unwelcome changes for them may lie ahead. But to Munster the winners both provide something essential now and will probably keep doing that as needs rapidly evolve.
“How people work five years from now is going to look very similar to the way we worked during the pandemic,” Munster said, and employers likely will want all the necessary tools in one package to enable that to work. Microsoft, he said, “is in a position to do that.”
Even now, counting up the services or products from Microsoft I use took more than the fingers of one hand. There’s writing with Microsoft Word on a Microsoft keyboard, retrieving documents stored in the cloud on OneDrive and connecting with colleagues through the video conferencing and messaging service called Teams.
When Monday morning comes and the mouse is clicked to get into OneDrive, it really needs to work.
And it will."
"July 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/m-health-fairview-unveils-retail-antibody-test-for-covid-19/571782542/,StarTribune,Minneapolis-based M Health Fairview offers retail antibody test for COVID-19,"A retail COVID-19 antibody test is now available through M Health Fairview that promotes 99% accuracy and offers an answer to all who believe they have already been infected with the coronavirus that causes the disease.
While leaders of the Minneapolis-based health care system note that the results have limits, they expect broad interest from patients who have wondered for months whether their sniffles and breathing problems were related to COVID-19.
“It helps alleviate a little bit of the worry and the stress that people are experiencing,” said Brittany Hartnett, a Fairview lab client relation specialist. “With just so many unknowns, this test can you give you some sort of an answer.”
Hennepin Healthcare, HealthPartners and North Memorial offer antibody tests, but Fairview is first in the Twin Cities to offer them without the need for a doctor visit or referral.
Rapidly expanding access to the serological blood test comes despite the limited value of the results. A positive test confirms that people’s immune systems produced antibodies in response to infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, but it doesn’t mean they have “immunity passports” or are free from future risks.
Researchers are examining whether people develop one-and-done immunity, similar to measles, or whether COVID-19 could end up as an evolving and persistent viral threat.
“One of the biggest downsides at the individual patient level is that, if someone tests positive, they consider that to mean that they are ‘immune’ and become more lax in their choices and behaviors with respect to physical distancing, potentially putting ­themselves at risk for re-infection,” said Dr. Elitza Theel, director of Mayo’s Infectious Diseases Serology Laboratory. “Right now, we want to avoid that risk at all costs.”
Mayo’s lab has conducted 180,000 antibody tests, including 70,000 for Minnesota hospitals and clinics.
Minnesota health officials echoed the concern that the state is at a sensitive juncture in the COVID-19 pandemic — with the addition on Wednesday of 578 confirmed cases and eight deaths bringing the state’s totals to 43,742 cases and 1,518 deaths.
A rising case count that landed Minnesota on New York’s travel restriction list this week is one reason for concern, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist. “We know that people are sick and tired of precautions and hearing about precautions, but this is not the time for us to let up our guard.”
Deaths and hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have declined over the past month. However, Lynfield predicted more deaths if Minnesota follows the pattern in other states right now of infections among young adults spreading to older, more vulnerable adults.
Plasma donors
One value of antibody testing is identifying patients who recovered from COVID-19 and can donate plasma, which can be used as an experimental therapy for others with severe forms of the disease.
Fairview is offering a $45 test to verify the presence of antibodies and a $55 option to determine whether people would make good plasma donors based on the quantities of antibodies in their blood.
Antibody testing involves blood draws and must be conducted after people have recovered from COVID-19 — usually at least 14 days after initial symptoms. It is different from the diagnostic tests that use nasal or throat swabs to detect active infections.
Insurance sometimes covers antibody tests when doctors request them, but patients must pay out-of-pocket for the retail tests, which are now available by appointment at six M Health Fairview sites.
Antibody testing also can reveal the share of people in a community who have been infected. That can otherwise be difficult to calculate due to the number of infections that don’t produce any symptoms.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention amassed antibody test results from clinics and blood banks last month and estimated 10 unknown infections for every one lab-confirmed case.
A Minnesota sampling of antibody tests from 983 blood donor volunteers showed a lower positivity rate of 1.2%.
While that was surprisingly low, health officials said it could be that blood donors are healthier or not reflective of the general population when it comes to the spread of COVID-19.
Early suspicions
The SARS-CoV-2 virus first emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. Minnesota reported its first known infection on March 6 and its first death on March 21, but some people suspect they might have had cases earlier than that.
Health coach Amber Moberg can’t shake the feeling that her four-week respiratory illness in January — following a vacation in South Dakota — was COVID-19.
Doctors ruled out influenza and strep but “chalked it up as ‘Midwest crud,’ ” the Scott County woman said. She didn’t challenge that because initial antibody tests cost $300.
Mark Haider lost his sense of taste and smell — classic COVID-19 symptoms — shortly before New Year’s Day, leading the Vadnais Heights man to wonder whether he suffered an infection even though it would have occurred weeks before the coronavirus was first identified in the U.S.
“I was sick for four months and lost 25 pounds,” he said.
HealthPartners has found a 4% positivity rate so far based on 2,882 antibody tests, and Hennepin Healthcare has reported an 11% positivity rate based on 740 tests. The need for a referral could explain the higher rates, because doctors would likely have suspicions about patients’ COVID-19 histories before approving testing.
State health officials said they would be concerned if antibody test results undercut their messaging about the need for people to wear masks in public and use basic hygiene practices, such as washing hands and covering coughs.
“There are still questions about immunity and about the length of immunity” after COVID-19, Lynfield said.
Gov. Tim Walz is weighing whether Minnesota should join 20 other states in requiring mask-wearing in public places.
In the absence of a mandate, more retailers such as Walmart are requiring masks in their stores and more evidence is supporting the idea that mask-wearers protect others around them from infection.
The CDC on Tuesday published a case report about two hairdressers in Missouri who wore masks while they had asymptomatic COVID-19 and didn’t infect any of their 139 customers.
Antibody tests could compel people to wear masks and follow guidelines, Hartnett said, if the results quash their suspicions that they were already infected.
“Because it’s a highly accurate test, it would be an answer,” Hartnett said, “whether it’s disappointing or not.”
Fairview is using an Abbott antibody test that received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and shows a published accuracy rate of 99%. The secondary test for the quantity of antibodies was developed at the University of Minnesota."
"July 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-falling-short-on-3-of-5-covid-19-goals/571777542/,StarTribune,Minnesota falling short on 3 of 5 COVID-19 goals,"Minnesota is now falling short on three of five goals self-imposed by state health authorities to evaluate their progress amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which as of Wednesday had caused 43,742 cases and 1,518 deaths.
The latest COVID-19 totals included the addition by the Minnesota Department of Health on Wednesday of another 578 lab-confirmed cases of the infectious disease and eight deaths.
Updated information on the state’s COVID-19 dashboard showed that Minnesota has a rate of 8 new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people per day — above the state’s target goal of 5 cases per 100,000. The rate on the public website is based only on cases through July 6 and doesn’t include a surge in cases last weekend that pushed Minnesota’s case rate above 10 per 100,000 and landed the state on New York’s travel restriction list.
Minnesotans are expected to complete online screenings when traveling to New York, Connecticut and New Jersey and voluntarily quarantine themselves for 14 days upon arrival.
Minnesota also is now missing its self-imposed target of no more than 30% of cases of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus, to come from unknown community sources. The rate of such mystery cases had been below that target all through June — with state contact tracers able to link infections to patrons at bars and outbreaks at worksites — but has risen to 32%.
Knowing the sources of infections allows state contact tracers to identify hot spots of COVID-19 and to warn people who might be at risk for exposure to the virus.
The state also is slightly above its goal for the rate of new hospitalizations for COVID-19, even though the number of people hospitalized for the infectious disease remains well below peak numbers in May. The state on Wednesday reported that 254 people were hospitalized for COVID-19 and that 106 needed intensive care. The state had reported 606 COVID-19 patients hospitalized on May 28.
The state is well above its goal for its rate of COVID-19 diagnostic testing per 100,000 residents, although that rate declined in early July amid a national rise in COVID-19 cases that stretched testing resources and supplies.
Only about 5% of diagnostic tests over the last week have found the coronavirus, which is better than the state threshold of 15%. A rate above that would suggest a rising spread of the virus in the state.
Recent increases in daily COVID-19 case counts have been fueled by young adults and teenagers — who now make up 35% of the state’s total cases but only two of the total deaths. Cases have more than doubled since June 1 among Minnesotans 29 and younger.
State health officials are concerned that Minnesota might follow the recent pattern of other states — with healthy young adults and teenagers passing the infection to people at higher risk due to their age and other health problems.
People 70 and older make up only 10% of COVID-19 cases in Minnesota, but 81% of the deaths.
Five of the eight deaths reported on Wednesday involved people living in long-term care or assisted-living facilities, bringing the death toll in that population to 1,180 people. One death reported Wednesday involved someone 49 or younger.
Among all cases, 38,179 have recovered to the point that they are no longer considered infection risks — though some have lingering breathing or other consequences from their infections.
Given the number of infections that result in mild or no symptoms, federal officials believe that there have been 10 unknown infections for every one diagnosed COVID-19 case in the U.S."
"July 15, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/could-president-joe-biden-hold-back-the-left-no/571777502/,StarTribune,Could President Joe Biden hold back the left? No.,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s great political strength is his studied affability.
He comes off like an elderly uncle on a TV sitcom — all white teeth and soft sweaters — genially rising out of his leather recliner to put an end to all this malarkey once and for all.
And President Donald Trump? He’s the loudmouthed barbarian who was elected to kick the Washington political establishment in the private parts, hard. And he’ll keep tweeting his crazy, often insensitive, and incendiary tweets and kicking until his foot falls off. And the establishment is kicking him back, harder.
“When people show you who they are, believe them the first time,” said Maya Angelou.
Biden wants to show us that he is Captain Nice, the anti-Trump, the old guy who loves ice cream, and tells his stories about his lifeguard heroics and those hairy legs of his that turn blond in the sun. He doesn’t appear threatening when reaching out to those all-important suburban women voters, with their hate-has-no-home-here signs that they hope will ward off the cancel culture when it comes for their husbands and children.
Biden offers them peace, even as he bobs to the hard left like a cork adrift upon the sea of (Alexandria Ocasio) Cortez. Yet this is his campaign’s implicit promise to America:
Just elect Biden president and allow Democrats to control the House and rule the Senate, and we’ll all go back to normal, whatever that was, to pre-Trump time. The deal is that if Biden is elected, perhaps the mindless mobs will relent and won’t tear down American history, defacing Lincoln, toppling Jefferson, Grant and abolitionists. To be clear, I do not support Confederate statues in places of honor. They belong in museums. But canceling George Washington?
The Biden promise is that if elected, the hysterical screaming over the past three years will end. The cancel culture won’t come for your kids or for you. The vandalizing of churches will stop. America will make friends with China again. The violence in our cities will subside. They might even not blow up Mount Rushmore, if we’re nice.
And no matter how you plan on voting, ask yourself a fair question: If elected president, will Biden be able to hold off his allies of the hard left as they seek more power?
No.
He can’t. Even if he were so inclined, which he’s not, the man just isn’t strong enough. He’s fading quickly. America sees he’s thin and getting thinner, which is why his handlers keep him safe in the basement, because Biden is just too little butter spread over too much bread.
But Biden, the Democrats and their media handmaidens don’t want to talk about any of this. They want the election to be a referendum on Trump and the coronavirus. And that is smart politics.
Trump has badly mishandled his messaging on the virus, foolishly boasting early on that it would be easily handled. It wasn’t. He’s seemed lost and angry, paranoid, and finally put on a mask the other day. If a Democrat were president, the Republicans would be hammering this hard, and they know it. The Democrats have the New York Times and the Washington Post. And so, they hammer hard, endlessly.
But that’s the framing. That is not the Biden campaign offer to America.
The offer is that if we elect Biden, we won’t be exhausted anymore, since exhausting the electorate is what politics has been about these three-plus years. The media and the woke world will stop screaming. We’ll attain some kind of normalcy. If Biden is elected, we’ll likely see news stories about the coronavirus in a different, positive light, telling us that Joe is trying, Joe is doing what he can, and we must not be selfish and help Joe.
Is the November election about Trump and Biden, or is it something larger now?
Each man is a symptom of larger issues. Trump was elected because the Republican establishment, which pushed endless war and drained the middle class of jobs shipped overseas, collapsed of its own corrupt weight. The Democratic establishment collapsed from pressure from the hard left, and now the left is in charge and offers Joe the passion and energy he lacks.
Biden hopes to ride this to the White House. And the left, using Ocasio-Cortez and her Gang of Four as symbiotes, plan on remaking America in ways that Barack Obama only dreamed of doing.
They’ve already showed us they want to eradicate capitalism. They showed us they will “reimagine” (i.e., defund) police in the violent cities run by Democratic mayors. Wealthy urban Democratic elites don’t have to worry. They’ll just hire private security guards, like they hire private teachers in the private schools for their kids.
If Biden is elected, the left will not stop using cancel culture to silence dissent, because it works. Diversity of opinion threatens them. History tells us the left is all about control and the use of government force to compel compliance. Corporate leaders are terrified of being canceled. Universities will continue to cave. The destruction of American history will continue, since to the zealots, the statues are idols, and toppling them is metaphor for reshaping history.
“People will do what they do,” shrugged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, when asked about the mob and the statues.
And Joe Biden will do what he does, and be a figurehead president, with the left calling the shots.

Tim Walz's emergency powers during COVID-19 pandemic,"The attorney for a group of Republican lawmakers and small-business owners argued before a state judge Thursday that the Minnesota Legislature was “lazy” and failed to set appropriate guidelines limiting the governor’s powers for handling the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergencies.
Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has made extensive use of peacetime emergency powers under state law to rapidly respond to the coronavirus pandemic, issuing 79 emergency orders since March. His actions, including school, church and business closings, have spurred eight cases in state and federal courts.
Walz’s emergency powers have become tied to ongoing negotiations over state infrastructure borrowing, police reform and other issues during the legislative special session.
The governor said Thursday he would be willing to hand over control of 30 of his executive orders to the Legislature. House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, has been a staunch opponent of Walz’s use of the powers and said in an e-mail Thursday that he has been meeting regularly with the governor’s office to develop “a limited set of tools to respond to COVID-19” in place of the emergency powers.
Ramsey County District Court Judge Thomas Gilligan heard arguments Thursday in one of the suits brought by 13 GOP state House and Senate members and various small businesses, including boxing clubs, a dance school and bar and grill.
Minnesota is not the only state where a governor’s emergency powers are being questioned. All but one state in the U.S. is under some form of emergency order, and similar lawsuits are being considered in courts across the country. They have drawn intense public interest, particularly from groups that see the pandemic restrictions as an infringement on civil liberties.
For Thursday’s hearing, 495 people tuned in to the Zoom call to watch the court debate play out, Gilligan noted.
Erick Kaardal, the attorney for the Republicans and businesses groups, argued that state lawmakers failed to include a key provision many years ago when they created the law delegating emergency authority to the governor. The law, he argued, should have required governors to use the “least restrictive means” possible when limiting people’s freedom during emergencies.
“The Legislature made a mistake and the governor has gone too far. And so now we are in a situation where the governor is acting like the Legislature and making laws without any restrictions,” Kaardal said.
Solicitor General Liz Kramer, representing Walz, said the law does provide for legislative review and limits on governors’ powers, even if they are not the restrictions Kaardal personally would have liked.
“That’s fine. But that doesn’t mean you get to come into court and enforce your different opinion. ... The governor and this court are bound by the law as it is,” she said.
Kaardal is seeking a writ blocking the governor from issuing more executive orders during the current state of peacetime emergency. Kramer asked the judge to dismiss the case.
Walz has extended the peacetime emergency and his accompanying powers repeatedly since March, with the latest extension lasting through mid-August. Each extension of the emergency triggers a special session of the Legislature, giving lawmakers a chance to veto the governor’s special powers.
The Republican majority in the Senate has repeatedly voted to end Walz’s powers, but the Democratic-led House has blocked those moves. Both chambers must agree to end the peacetime emergency.
Kaardal said that requiring the Legislature to veto emergency powers is unconstitutional. But Kramer countered that is one of the ways Walz’s powers are checked. There are also the many legal cases taking place to scrutinize the actions of the governor, and Walz’s orders must be reviewed by Attorney General Keith Ellison and other constitutional officers who make up a state executive committee.
Gilligan questioned how a governor could quickly respond to emergencies without some form of unilateral powers, and said it seems the Legislature already built into the law a way to end the emergency powers if lawmakers want to.
“I’m a little bit uncomfortable being the referee between two branches of government,” he said. He set no date for a decision."
"July 16, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/second-u-study-shows-no-hydroxychloroquine-benefit-in-covid-19-fight/571791202/,StarTribune,Second University of Minnesota study shows no hydroxychloroquine benefit in COVID-19 fight,"An anti-malaria drug that doctors hoped would work against COVID-19, and that President Donald Trump championed and said he took himself, has failed to show substantial benefit in a second University of Minnesota trial.
U researchers compared 491 people with early symptoms of COVID-19 — with one group taking hydroxychloroquine for five days and the other taking a non-medicating placebo — and found no measurable differences in their outcomes.
Death rates of 0.4% were identical in the groups. Hospitalizations and persistent symptoms over 14 days were slightly more common in the placebo group, but not by a significant margin. Mostly mild side effects such as nausea were reported by 43% of patients taking the drug vs. 22% taking placebos.
The results were hardly what U researchers hoped for in March when they launched one of the world’s first clinical trials of any drug for COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus.
“This is definitely not what we thought was going to happen,” said Dr. David Boulware, a leader of the trial and a U infectious disease physician.
No known treatments for COVID-19 existed at the time — and few have been proven even now — but Boulware and colleagues were optimistic because hydroxychloroquine was cheap and widely available and affected the very same ACE-2 receptors that the virus attacks on cells.
The study adds to a volume of evidence that discourages the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 — including the first trial result that the U published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month that showed that the drug offered no protection for people who likely had been exposed to the virus and were at risk for infection.
The results leave the world thin on proven treatments for COVID-19, which to date has been confirmed in Minnesota in 44,347 cases and 1,526 deaths. That includes 611 cases and eight deaths reported Thursday by the Health Department.
A large U.S. trial showed that an antiviral, remdesivir, offered some benefits for hospitalized patients with severe symptoms. The large British RECOVERY trial also showed a reduction in deaths for patients who took the steroid dexamethasone — which HCMC in Minneapolis had already been using aggressively in off-label treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Aside from drug therapies, Minnesota doctors said they have improved survival rates for severe COVID-19 cases through better respiratory support and judgments about when and how to use ventilators to help patients breathe.
Minnesota hospital outcomes data showed death rates above 40% in April and May for patients needing placement on ventilators or heart-lung bypass machines. That rate dropped to 31% in June.
‘Just didn’t work’
Hospitalizations for COVID-19 reached their lowest numbers in Minnesota since mid-April — with 249 patients hospitalized on Thursday and 103 receiving intensive care.
But state health officials are concerned that an uptick in cases among young adults could soon spread the virus to older and more vulnerable adults, which could in turn lead to more hospitalizations and deaths. Cases among people 29 and younger have more than doubled in Minnesota since June 1, outpacing overall case growth.
The second U trial suggests that hydroxychloroquine won’t be part of the solution, but whether it will be phased out entirely from COVID-19 treatment is unclear. One wild card is whether Trump continues to use his influential Twitter feed to promote the drug despite the study results.
Boulware said political divisions over the unproven benefits of the drug made his team’s research harder — because Trump’s advocacy was being countered by some doctors warning that hydroxychloroquine might present risks.
Both perspectives slowed national online recruiting for the U clinical trial — because opponents believed it was too risky to take the drug while supporters believed it was so effective that they didn’t want to risk ending up in the placebo arm of the study.
“It turns out that neither perspective is true,” Boulware said. “It is a safe medicine, but it just didn’t work.”
The U has yet to publish results from a third trial in which hydroxychloroquine was used to prevent COVID-19 in people who had yet to be exposed to the virus or show any symptoms of infection.
Boulware said there was hope that zinc would boost the effectiveness of the drug, but neither of the U’s first two studies showed any improved benefit for patients who took that supplement.
A sad end?
The latest U trial showed a slight benefit among people with early COVID-19 symptoms who were older, but too few people were in the study in this age group to be statistically significant, Boulware said. The online method of recruiting volunteers from 40 states and three Canadian provinces produced a younger study group.
Roughly 60% of the study group was health care workers. A lack of COVID-19 diagnostic testing at the time meant some enrolled patients were presumed to have the infectious disease based on their symptoms and exposure to known cases.
The National Institutes of Health canceled two hydroxychloroquine studies in May — one because the drug wasn’t showing any benefit and the other because of a lack of enrollment. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month revoked an emergency use authorization supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.
The British RECOVERY group issued an early version of study results on Wednesday, showing no difference in deaths among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine vs. standard care. Length of hospitalizations and the use of ventilators increased in the group taking the medication.
On the other hand, an observational study of 2,500 hospitalized patients at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit found a 50% lower death risk in those who took hydroxychloroquine. Trump’s last tweet about the drug on July 7 lauded this study.
The U trials were unique and among the world’s first for a COVID-19 drug to be blinded and placebo-controlled — meaning that patients didn’t know whether or not they were taking the medication.
The latest U trial results in the Annals of Internal Medicine were accompanied by an editorial, which stated that the debate on hydroxychloroquine should be over after the British results are finalized.
“If the peer-reviewed findings confirm the preliminary reports of no benefit in sicker patients in the National Institutes of Health and RECOVERY trials, the saga of hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 will likely reach its sad end,” wrote Dr. Neil Schluger of New York Medical College."
"July 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/tensions-rise-with-russia-and-china/571808332/,StarTribune,Tensions rise with Russia and China,"On Thursday, the United States, United Kingdom and Canada alleged that hackers tied to Russian intelligence agencies are targeting Western entities working on a coronavirus vaccine.
A day before, in just the latest sign of Sino-American tension, it was reported that the Trump administration was mulling a travel ban for members of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as their families.
These events are just the most recent episodes in a series of intensifying divisions between the U.S. and its two major geopolitical rivals, Russia and China. There are other, equally fraught fractures factoring into the divides.
With China, this includes several trade-related disputes, as well as Beijing's bellicose approach to its own citizens in Western China and Hong Kong. Abroad, Chinese troops recently had deadly clashes with Indian forces along a disputed border, and the nation continues its historic hostility to Taiwan, as well as more recent aggression in the South China Sea, where China's maritime claims were officially declared unlawful by the State Department last week. Adding to the martial tensions are technological fissures, reflected in the U.K.'s joining the U.S. in banning China's Huawei from use in the developing 5G wireless network.
Ongoing U.S.-Russian divisions can be seen in several issues, including enduring election interference. Meanwhile, lethal militarism in Ukraine, Crimea, Syria and elsewhere, as well as allegations of Russian bounties on U.S. forces in Afghanistan, strain Washington-Moscow ties.
Add to that arms control, which has been spinning out of control in recent years. ""The framework we inherited from U.S.-Soviet competition is practically gone,"" Eugene Rumer, a former national intelligence officer who is now the director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said during a webinar last week. If so, the U.S. and Russia ""will be in an unrestrained, unrestricted arms race with a host of new technologies entering the strategic stability equation. That will be likely be highly destabilizing.""
Stabilization on this or other issues with Russia and China might not be able to rely on formerly reliable Cold War constructs. The three nations are ""not part of a dynamic triangle, where the U.S. can play one off the other,"" said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at Carnegie. ""The Sino-Russian partnership is a good deal more than an access of convenience, and one of — if not the — principle adhesives in that relationship is an effort to check U.S. influence regionally and globally.""
This adhesive is based on two factors, said Susan Thornton, a former diplomat who is now a senior fellow at Yale Law School. Economics, with the Chinese the ""unbalanced driver of the train, which may be a bit uncomfortable for Russia,"" as well as ""the convergence of attitudes of the two governments about what the West and the U.S. is doing."" In this component, the Kremlin is more the driver, Thornton said.
The pandemic may be global, but the U.S. political debate about it is mostly domestic, especially because of President Donald Trump's reckless response to the crisis. Other vital stateside issues — including one literally originating here at home with the death of George Floyd — like social justice are appropriately paramount to voters.
But foreign policy should not get eclipsed in the campaign, and the debate must go beyond who's ""soft"" on China and Russia to who's smart about them.
That means recognizing reality. The U.S.-Russia bilateral relationship is ""the worst since the Cold War,"" said Rumer. Likewise, the U.S.-China bilateral relationship has devolved to ""managed enmity,"" said Evan Feigenbaum, vice president for studies at Carnegie. ""The two sides are not only not working together, they are actively obstructing each other and doing it without some guardrails.""
Fortunately, the U.S. has some longstanding alliances to better respond to the Russian and Chinese challenges. Unfortunately, many of these relationships are severely strained because Trump has either not tended to them, or tended to alienate these allies through unproductive provocations.
The U.S., said Feigenbaum, has ""an attitude but not a strategy."" Now, more than ever, voters should consider both the president's and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden's strategy, and not just attitude, on responding to Russia and China."
"July 17, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/biden-s-gun-control-plan-is-terrible-for-poor-in-the-financial-sense-firearm-owners/571802612/,StarTribune,Biden's gun control plan is terrible for poor (in the financial sense) firearm owners,"Over the past few weeks, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has been rolling out task forces, policy platforms and all manner of other legislative bells and whistles as he ramps up his bid to unseat President Donald Trump. Predictably, none of his proposals have hit with the same force as progressive blockbusters such as “Medicare for All” or the “Green New Deal” (neither of which he supports). But Biden did shake the table in a different way in 2019 when he debuted his gun control platform. Later that year, when he bumbled into a heated exchange with a Detroit factory worker, who accused him of trying to “take away our guns,” right-wingers and gun rights groups gloated over the spectacle. But even now, after the world has changed several times over, it’s still hard to shake the feeling that that worker was right. To the dismay of firearm enthusiasts on the left, Biden is still coming for some people’s guns. It’s now just a matter of who’s going to have them snatched — and who isn’t.
Former congressman Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, may have pulled the most attention with his brash anti-gun rhetoric during the primaries, but Biden’s less ambitious plan still offers plenty of cause for alarm for firearm owners. Alongside a raft of more common-sense measures (and a confusing aside about “smart gun technology”), its centerpiece is a ban on the manufacture and sale of what are known as “assault weapons,” with a proposal to bring their regulation under the National Firearms Act. This 1934 law currently applies to “machine guns” (i.e., fully automatic firearms), silencers and short-barreled rifles, but Biden’s plan would extend it to apply to what he characterizes as “assault weapons,” meaning semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns with interchangeable magazines that fire intermediate cartridges (the most notorious of which is the AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle) as well as “high capacity magazines” (generally understood under the 1994 bill to be those that can hold more than 10 bullets). Individuals who already own these items would be required to either participate in a federal buyback program or register each of their qualifying firearms and magazines under the NFA — which comes with a $200 price tag (on top of extra fees incurred during the registration process). When it was first enacted in 1934, that $200 fee was intended to be prohibitively expensive; now, inflation aside, it still is for many people.
Given how costly some firearms can be, that registration fee may not sound like too much of an added burden, but for a person who has already bought and paid for multiple qualifying firearms and magazines (or inherited them), that amount will add up quickly. Those who violate the NFA will also face up to 10 years in federal prison, and a potential $10,000 fine. Biden also wants to end the online sale of firearms and ammunition, including gun parts and parts kits that some people use to manufacture their own low-cost DIY firearms (known as ghost guns) further limiting accessibility.
Regardless of one’s opinion on guns and gun control, it is obvious that this proposal will disproportionately affect poor and working-class communities. Those within those communities who already own firearms would be robbed of their ability to protect themselves and their loved ones, while their wealthier counterparts would skate by on their ready piles of cash. Stephen Paddock perpetrated one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history and could afford dozens of high-powered weapons and a plush Las Vegas hotel suite; this plan would have no effect on someone like him. In effect, Biden’s plan sets in motion a “war on guns,” the same way his predecessors declared wars on “poverty,” “crime” and “terror” — wars in which it was inevitably black and brown people who were the real targets.
Although acknowledging that the fact may be uncomfortable for Biden, millions of people in this country own firearms, and not all of them fit into the stereotype of the right-wing gun nut. Armed community defense is a timeworn activist tradition that has once again entered the spotlight as the Black Lives Matter movement has continued to build across the nation. Protesters in various cities have been met with violence from self-proclaimed white supremacists, militias and assorted right-wing malcontents with money to burn on the biggest guns they can find. In some cases, armed community members have stepped up to serve as a barrier between the people and those who seek to cause them harm. Whether anyone “needs” an AR-15 is beside the point; simply put, heavily armed right-wing militia members have threatened protesters, and others on the right have even shot at them. With that in mind, some folks don’t want to be left empty-handed when self-proclaimed white supremacists or other right-wing extremists come marching into their community. And it is those community defenders and other regular working people who will bear the brunt of this proposed legislative switch.
Biden’s plan falls into a long line of government efforts to disarm the working class while keeping the lanes clear for the privileged who can afford whatever legal curveballs are thrown their way. A crystallizing moment in the history of the U.S. gun control movement came in 1967, when the Black Panthers held an armed protest on the steps of the California Capitol; at the time, hoping to keep guns out of the hands of black people, the National Rifle Association pushed hard in favor of gun control, and strict legislation soon followed. The NRA’s stance on gun control has taken a hard right turn since then, but as was shown by its silence when Philando Castile, a black gun owner, was killed by police, some things haven’t changed much at all.
On the most generous reading, the goal of Biden’s plan is to ensure that there are fewer guns in the world and in the streets. But even in that spirit, we still have to think about who’s going to end up with the guns that remain in private hands. People such Mark McCloskey, the lawyer made infamous for brandishing his AR-15 at Black Lives Matter protesters as they walked past his sprawling St. Louis mansion, will be able to pay whatever fees Biden throws at them, and will thus be able to hold onto as many weapons as they like. But territorial weekend warriors who feel no accountability to the community, and show little regard for gun safety, are exactly the kind of people who shouldn’t have guns. By contrast, leftist community firearm clubs invest serious time into training and safety education, carefully vet their memberships and work arm-in-arm with the marginalized communities they are invited to protect.
And yet under Biden’s plan, the former are who will be able to afford to hold onto as much firepower as they so desire, while the people they want to hurt will be left high and dry. Simply depriving poorer people access to firearms will not rectify the structural issues such as poverty, inequality and lack of economic mobility that are correlated with gun violence. The plan says nothing about handguns, which are responsible for far more deaths than other kinds of guns, or about expanding mental health services, or disarming the police who are responsible for an unconscionable amount of gun deaths. Nor does it do anything about the networks of right-wing radicalism that have inspired the overwhelming majority of domestic terrorist attacks or the media pundits and politicians (including Trump himself) whose rhetoric exacerbates the problem. It just focuses on the big, scary guns. If cutting down on gun violence is the end goal here, what good could it possibly do to disarm the working class and ensure that only the well-heeled (and the agents of the state who defend them) will be able to hoard stockpiles of highly efficient weaponry? Gun sales have already skyrocketed during the ongoing coronavirus crisis, and political tensions throughout the country are incredibly high. This divisive plan would do little to curb gun violence, and would instead hammer home the vast inequalities still dividing this nation."
"July 18, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/we-might-wear-our-masks-yet-if-behavioral-science-is-correct/571806522/,StarTribune,We might wear our masks yet if behavioral science is correct,"Retailers like Best Buy Co. last week made shoppers’ lives better by requiring face coverings in their stores, and not just by making the stores safer to work in or visit.
Soon there will be no choice but to wear a mask into stores from Walmart to Target to Costco. And fewer choices to make is one thing we all could use.
Eliminating decisions that need to be made turns out to be one good answer to a vexing question: how to meet the challenge of protecting yourself from the novel coronavirus and the resulting illness, COVID-19.
It’s now more than half a year into this terrible infectious-disease crisis. The evidence has gotten stronger on the benefits of wearing face masks to reduce transmission. The same goes for the importance of staying out of close contact with other people who might only be talking or singing, particularly indoors and in poorly ventilated spaces.
Could it really be that people struggle with the self-control required to wear masks all the time or stay away from house parties?
“I think you are on to something,” replied Kathleen Vohs, a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management with a deep background in psychology and human behavior.
The COVID-19 pandemic created a perfect storm for behavior challenges, she said in an e-mail. It has combined our need for being part of groups and seeing other people, hard to satisfy these days, with a fluid and risky situation where we have to decide what’s prudent to do.
The problem with confronting tough choices is not just that they are hard. Vohs and others in the field have shown that making decisions, over and over throughout a day, can use up our capacity for self-control.
“It’s not a surprise that we are seeing behaviors such as people forgoing masks and gathering in closely packed groups,” she explained. “I am not saying that I think those are wise choices, but rather that they are predictable from a behavioral science standpoint.”
Vohs teaches aspiring managers that they should know how people process information and make decisions in the marketplace, including when deciding what to buy.
A great example of psychology research in business is on the benefits of consumer choice. Consumers usually say they love having choice, but they may not really mean it. Lots of research has shown that if consumers feel overwhelmed by too much choice, they might not buy anything.
Shoppers were more likely to buy, and be happier with their choice, when selecting between six different kinds of jam rather than 24. So why offer them 24?
As for this more or less fixed capacity to make decisions, maybe the way to think of it is as a kind of battery that recharges overnight and then gets run down.
One problem with this limited resource, particularly with an infectious disease in the community, is that it’s the same battery that people need to keep powering their self-control.
Ever snack at the end of a long and stressful workday, maybe put away a whole box of Girl Scout Cookies? That’s the kind of thing that probably wouldn’t happen just after breakfast.
Maybe Vohs wouldn’t love this description, but I think of self-control as the ability to override the impulse to do something when after a little thought, we land on a much better option — like a hard pass on the invitation to join friends at a birthday party when there’s a slew of new COVID-19 cases being reported every day.
The experiments Vohs and her research colleagues have done on decisions that later influence self-control are all fascinating. One asked subjects to make a bunch of choices and then tested how much of a vinegar-flavored beverage they could be persuaded to drink.
Another probed the effects of declining capacity by looking into how well shoppers at a mall could do arithmetic problems, noting when they gave up trying, after having made varying numbers of purchase choices.
Since everyone seems to exhaust this intellectual resource eventually, it seemed important to get some 2020 recommendations from Vohs. Her thoughts boiled down to enhancing our ability to make good decisions by cutting down on the number we have to make.
One trick might be to establish and stick to routines, like establishing laundry day, rather than getting to the evening and then trying to decide whether there’s any energy left for sorting and washing a couple of loads. Plan the week’s dinner menu, eliminating having to decide what’s for dinner each night.
Maybe this pandemic era isn’t the best time to embark on self-improvement, either, like getting in better physical shape. Odds aren’t good people would make much progress anyway, and the effort would come at the expense of doing the things they know will keep them safer.
“On a more mundane level, people also could give themselves a break on daily tasks that require decisionmaking and self-control,” Vohs added. “Maybe the bed doesn’t need to be made every day. Maybe the shower doesn’t need to be cleaned each week. Maybe it’s OK if the house is not as tidy as you’d otherwise have it.”
She has found that she is watching a lot more cable TV lately when she ordinarily would prefer something from the premium streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.
To stream, she would have to spark up another electronic device and then scroll through options of what to watch. Cable TV is less taxing.
Maybe the best way to cut down on necessary decisions isn’t really her suggestion, but mine — and it’s maybe the simplest one:
Stay home unless someone really needs to be out."
"July 19, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/as-trump-ignores-virus-crisis-republicans-start-to-contradict-him/571828631/,StarTribune,"As Trump ignores virus crisis, Republicans start to contradict him","President Donald Trump’s failure to contain the coronavirus outbreak and his refusal to promote clear public-health guidelines have left many senior Republicans despairing that he will ever play a constructive role in addressing the crisis, with some concluding they must work around Trump and ignore or even contradict his pronouncements.
In recent days, some of the most prominent figures in the GOP outside the White House have broken with Trump over issues like the value of wearing a mask in public and heeding the advice of health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who the president and other hard-right figures within the administration have subjected to caustic personal criticism.
They appear to be spurred by several overlapping forces, including deteriorating conditions in their own states, Trump’s seeming indifference to the problem and the approach of a presidential election in which Trump is badly lagging his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, in the polls.
Once-reticent Republican governors are now issuing orders on mask-wearing and business restrictions that run counter to Trump’s demands. Some of those governors have been holding late-night phone calls among themselves to trade ideas and grievances; they have sought out partners in the administration other than the president, including Vice President Mike Pence, who, despite echoing Trump in public, is seen by governors as far more attentive to the continuing disaster.
“The president got bored with it,” David Carney, an adviser to the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, a Republican, said of the pandemic. He noted that Abbott directs his requests to Pence, with whom he speaks two to three times a week.
A handful of Republican lawmakers in the Senate have privately pressed the administration to bring back health briefings led by figures like Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, who regularly updated the public during the spring until Trump upstaged them with his own briefing-room monologues. And in his home state of Kentucky last week, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, broke with Trump on nearly every major issue related to the virus.
McConnell stressed the importance of mask-wearing, expressed “total” confidence in Fauci and urged Americans to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Trump has ignored or dismissed.
“The straight talk here that everyone needs to understand is: This is not going away until we get a vaccine,” McConnell said Wednesday, contradicting Trump’s rosy predictions.
The result is a quiet but widening breach between Trump and leading figures in his party, as the virus burns through major political battlegrounds in the South and the West, like in the states of Arizona, Texas and Georgia.
Amid mounting alarm in a huge portion of the country, Trump has at times appeared to inhabit a different universe, incorrectly predicting the outbreak would quickly dissipate and falsely claiming the spread of the virus was simply a function of increased testing. With his impatient demands and decrees, Trump has disrupted efforts to mitigate the crisis while effectively sidelining himself from participating in those efforts.
The emerging rifts in Trump’s party have been slow to develop, but they have rapidly deepened since a new surge in coronavirus cases began to sweep the country last month.
In the final days of June, the governor of Utah, Gary Herbert, a Republican, joined other governors on a conference call with Pence and urged the administration to do more to combat a sense of “complacency” about the virus. Herbert said it would help states like his own if Trump and Pence were to encourage mask-wearing on a national scale, according to a recording of the call.
“As a responsible citizen, if you care about your neighbor, if you love your neighbor, let us show the respect necessary by wearing a mask,” Herbert said, offering language to Pence and adding, “That’s where I think you and the president can help us out.”
Pence told Herbert the suggestion was “duly noted” and said that mask-wearing would be a “very consistent message” from the administration.
But no such appeal was ever forthcoming from Trump, who asserted days later that the virus would “just disappear.”
Trump has offered only hedged recommendations on wearing masks and has rarely worn one himself in public; in a Fox interview that was broadcast Sunday, the president said he would not issue a national mask order, because Americans deserve “a certain freedom” on the matter.
Some of the states where outbreaks have worsened most in recent weeks are led by Republicans who spent months avoiding stringent lockdowns, in some cases because state leaders were uneasy about creating space between themselves and a president of their own party who rejected such steps. That dynamic has been particularly pronounced in Southern states like Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, where governors have either continued to resist tough public-health restrictions or have only recently and partially embraced them.
A few Republicans have grown more open with their misgivings about Trump’s approach, including Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who said this month that he would require people to wear masks at any Trump rallies in his state. After issuing a broad mask mandate last week, Hutchinson said on the ABC program “This Week” on Sunday that an “example needs to be set by our national leadership” on mask-wearing.
Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, in an interview on “Meet the Press” on NBC, did not answer directly when asked if he had confidence in Trump’s leadership in the crisis. DeWine said he had confidence “in this administration” and praised Pence for “doing an absolutely phenomenal job.”
Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, rejected criticisms of Trump’s approach.
“Any suggestion that the president is not working around the clock to protect the health and safety of all Americans, lead the whole-of-government response to this pandemic, including expediting vaccine development, and rebuild our economy is utterly false,” Deere said in a statement.
With only a few exceptions, Republicans have avoided direct confrontation with Trump. They’ve come to view public criticism as an exercise in political futility — one guaranteed to produce a sour response from Trump without any chance of changing his behavior.
But many Republican lawmakers have grown exasperated with the administration’s conflicting messages, the open warfare within Trump’s staff and the president’s demands that states reopen faster or risk punishment from the federal government.
Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said he wanted the administration to offer more extensive public-health updates to the American people, and condemned the open animosity toward Fauci by some administration officials, including Peter Navarro, the trade adviser, who wrote an opinion column attacking Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.
“I want more briefings but, more importantly, I want the whole White House to start acting like a team on a mission to tackle a real problem,” Sasse said. “Navarro’s Larry, Moe and Curly junior-high slap fight this week is yet another way to undermine public confidence that these guys grasp that tens of thousands of Americans have died and tens of millions are out of work.”
Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., was more succinct: “The more they turn the briefings over to the professionals, the better.”
A group of Republican governors have for months held regular conference calls, usually at night and without staff present, according to two party strategists familiar with the conversations. Unlike the virus-focused calls that Pence leads, there are no Democratic or White House officials on the line, so the conversations have become a sort of safe space where the governors can ask their counterparts for advice, discuss best practices and, if the mood strikes them, vent about the administration and the president’s erratic leadership.
Trump himself seems less interested in the specific challenges the virus presents and is mostly just frustrated by the reality that it has not disappeared as he has predicted. The disconnect is only growing between him and other party leaders — not to mention voters. A poll published Friday by ABC News and The Washington Post found that a majority of the country strongly disapproved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, and about two-thirds of Americans said they had little or no trust in Trump’s comments about the disease.
Trump’s political standing is now so dire that even Republicans who have spent years avoiding direct comment on his behavior are acknowledging his unpopularity in plain terms. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, for instance, offered a bleak assessment of Trump’s electoral standing at a recent event hosted by Solamere, a company with close ties to Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and his family.
According to a partial transcript of the comments, shared by a person close to him, the usually tight-lipped Ryan said Trump was losing key voting blocs across the Midwest and in Arizona, a Republican-leaning state that Ryan described as “presently trending against us.”
While Ryan did not criticize Trump’s handling of the outbreak, he said the president could not win reelection this year if he continued losing badly to Biden among suburban voters who were wary of both candidates but currently favor Biden.
“Biden is winning over Trump in this category of voters 70 to 30,” Ryan said, “and if that sticks, he cannot win states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.”
Some of Trump’s closest advisers are adamant that the best way forward is to downplay the dangers of the disease. Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, has been particularly forceful in his view that the White House should avoid drawing attention to the virus, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Meadows has for the most part opposed any briefings about the virus, while other Trump advisers, including Hope Hicks and Jared Kushner, have been open to holding briefings so long as they are not at the White House — where Trump could show up and commandeer them. Pence’s team would like to hold more briefings with the health experts, but some of Trump’s communications aides do not want the vice president to be part of them.
A large number of rank-and-file Republican lawmakers share Trump’s aversion to the disease-control practices.
Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican closely aligned with Trump, issued an order Wednesday blocking local governments from mandating mask-wearing, then sued the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, for imposing such a requirement. Kemp’s edict came hours after Trump visited his state, declining to wear a face mask at the Atlanta airport.
Yet some in the GOP now see no alternative to parting ways with Trump, on policy if not politics.
Glenn Hamer, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a powerful business federation in the crucial state, said he saw Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, walking a prudent line — breaking with Trump’s policy demands but not blasting the president for issuing them.
“Everyone knows that the president doesn’t react well to criticism, constructive or not,” he said.
Hamer, who was among a group of business leaders who sent a letter to the White House urging the creation of clearer national standards for facial coverings, said Trump presented a challenge to Republican leaders seeking to foster responsible behavior.
“On the mask side, it is difficult when the leader of the party had been setting a pretty bad example,” Hamer said."
"July 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/a-double-burden-covid-19-amplifies-burden-of-cancer/571827771/,StarTribune,COVID-19 amplifies burden of cancer for these Minnesotans,"As COVID-19 deaths peaked this spring, Teri Woodhull faced a tough decision on treatments for cancer — a condition that already makes her more vulnerable to the pandemic.
Woodhull could lower her risk of being exposed to the coronavirus by undergoing chemotherapy every three weeks, rather than weekly. But less-frequent treatments are delivered with a stronger dose, raising the possibility of more severe side effects.
“When you’re going through treatment for cancer, it’s emotional already,” said Woodhull, 57, of Minnetonka, who was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer in 2010. “When you layer on the stress of not knowing whether the choices you’re making might be endangering you even more — it just piles on.”
For cancer patients in Minnesota, COVID-19 has altered treatments, paused clinical trials and limited connections with friends and family in the midst of a dreaded diagnosis. Thousands of mammograms and colon­oscopies were delayed in March and April as hospitals and clinics marshaled resources to fight COVID-19.
Now, as the health care system slowly returns to pre-COVID norms, doctors are uneasy because patients seem to be steering clear of care, despite reassurances about the safety of health care facilities. One possible consequence is that cancers will be caught later, when treatment options are more difficult.
“A delay of six weeks is probably not going to have a significant oncologic outcome impact or change for any individual patient or even a population,” said Dr. Natasha Rueth, a cancer surgeon at Allina Health System. “I’m more worried about the downstream effects of people not coming into the health care system now, and what that’s going to mean for future cancer patients.”
To conserve supplies for treating COVID-19 patients, Minnesota joined other states in halting elective and nonemergency medical procedures, beginning the evening of March 23. The ban was lifted about seven weeks later, on May 11.
States also issued stay-at-home orders this spring, which further contributed to cancer patients staying away from health care, said Dr. Norman Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute, in an editorial in the journal Science. He projected that COVID-19 could result in almost 10,000 excess deaths — an increase of about 1% — beyond the expected toll from breast and colorectal cancer over the next decade.
Some doctors and public health experts question the projections, in part because there is controversy over the net impact of cancer screening. But concerns are growing, nonetheless, that patients are avoiding cancer care in ways that could have harmful consequences.
New patient consults and newly diagnosed cancer patients are down more than 20% compared with the same period a year ago, say doctors with Minnesota Oncology, a group of 55 cancer specialists with 12 offices across the Twin Cities. They’ve begun seeing more late-stage cancers relative to prior rates, as well.
“Now that we’re six months into this pandemic, delayed screenings are becoming a public health issue,” said Dr. Paul Thurmes, the medical director with Minnesota Oncology.
Delayed treatment
At Allina Health System, about 7,500 mammograms were delayed between March and May. In general, a majority of breast cancers are likely to be slower growing, Rueth said, and would not go from curable to incurable, or even significantly advanced, in two months.
But she added: “We know that a lot of women aren’t coming in.”
Thousands of colonoscopies have been delayed at MNGI Digestive Health, which operates seven surgery centers across the Twin Cities. The test screens for colon cancers that often are slow-growing, so a delay of a few months shouldn’t be risky in most cases, said Dr. David Perdue, chief medical officer.
Even so, missed appointments are troubling because short delays can snowball into longer ones.
“They were on the cusp — the doctor finally had them talked into it — and then this happened,” Perdue said of COVID-19. “It’s another [reason] to not do it, or delay it some more.”
Cancer patients have missed out on clinical trials since studies were paused in part to reduce exposure risks, said Dr. Britt Erickson, a gynecologic oncologist at the University of Minnesota. The U tried to keep open, or reopen as quickly as possible, those studies that offered the most patient benefits by providing access to promising experimental treatments, Erickson said.
Researchers have been slower to resume studies that primarily offer benefits down the road — such as Erickson’s study of whether a hormone therapy helps slow tumor progression for patients with endometrial cancer. But those moves have long-term consequences.
Woodhull, the cancer patient from Minnetonka, isn’t alone in having to consider COVID-19 risks when making decisions about chemotherapy options, said Dr. Andrea Wahner Hendrickson, a cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic. Choices are tougher now because doctors and patients must consider how some regimens do more to suppress the immune system.
“There’s a whole new level of risk that we didn’t have to worry about before,” Wahner Hendrickson said. “We know that our cancer patients, if they come down with COVID, are likely going to have a more difficult course.”
Communities usually rally around newly diagnosed cancer patients, with friends making meals and families visiting regularly. But the need for social distancing with COVID-19 makes it harder for them to provide support. It gets even more complicated for cancer patients who are nearing the end of life.
“Obviously, we want people to follow [public health] guidelines,” Wahner Hendrickson said. “But if you know someone is terminal or on hospice, finding that balance to make sure that they are seeing their loved ones and having those quality times — stress and anxiety wise, that’s really been tough on our cancer patients.”
Compounded trauma
Kris Nozal is thankful her support groups through Gilda’s Club and Pathways are still available online, but she misses the personal connections.
“It’s a very sad adjustment to lose your normal life to cancer,” said Nozal, 48, of Burnsville. “And now, the uncertainty of how long COVID will be a threat, pushes that ... sadness, fear, frustration and helplessness to a whole new level.”
Kate Beesch felt the isolation as she underwent a biopsy in March, when visitor restrictions meant her sister couldn’t stay in the recovery room.
“It’s one time when you’d really like to have support from your family,” Beesch, a 38-year-old Minneapolis resident, said of receiving the cancer diagnosis that day. “You’re in a pandemic and you also have cancer; and you want to treat your cancer but you also don’t want to get the virus. It’s like compounded traumas.”
This spring, when Woodhull had to decide on chemotherapy options, she opted for less frequent treatments to help minimize her COVID-19 exposure.
On Wednesday, in preparation for chemotherapy, she visited a special lab in Minneapolis at M Health Fairview for blood work. The facility was created since the pandemic started, specifically to lower infection risks for patients with cancer and other high-risk conditions — an example of how health care facilities are doing “an extraordinary job in trying to protect us,” Woodhull said.
Woodhull regularly attends virtual meetings with patients who agree COVID-19 has amped up the stress of cancer — which is particularly bad, she says, since some research suggests lower stress correlates with better cancer outcomes.
“Cancer stinks. COVID stinks,” said Woodhull, who is a board member with the advocacy group Minnesota Ovarian Cancer Alliance. “When you layer the two together, it just makes my cancer that much harder to deal with.”"
"July 20, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/honor-john-lewis-and-pass-voting-rights-bill/571839891/,StarTribune,Honor John Lewis and pass voting-rights bill,"A 65-foot mural in Atlanta reflects the larger-than-life legacy of U.S. Rep. John Lewis, the civil-rights icon who died of pancreatic cancer on Saturday.
In many places across the country, flags were flown at half-staff for the man who made ""good trouble"" advocating for a righteous cause. On Capitol Hill, Lewis' congressional colleagues honored the Georgia Democrat on Monday, with lawmakers across party lines lining up to televise or tweet their condolences and respect. From the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Donald Trump called Lewis a ""civil rights hero."" And soon, an announcement of funeral plans will further detail how Congress, and by extension the country, will pay homage to the life and legacy of the social-justice giant.
But beyond the remembrances, what his fellow lawmakers, the president, and everyday citizens shouldn't forget is that Lewis didn't rest on his well-deserved laurels but forever fought to advance them, and that his life's work of advocating for equality is not complete.
To take another step, the Senate and Trump should support the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which the Democrat-controlled House passed in 2019.
The Senate, with Republicans in the majority, has failed to act on the bill. Trump hasn't backed it either, and in fact at every turn seems to want to backtrack on the progress Lewis and the other giants of his generation fought so hard to achieve.
On Sunday, Trump cast doubt on whether he would accept the results of November's election. In an interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace, Trump said, ""You don't know until you see,"" seeming to hold his options open on the efficacy of the election. His criticism has focused on mail-in voting — an election method he and his family, as well as several states, have used with no evidence of any significant meddling.
Particularly during a pandemic, where voters and poll workers may literally have to risk illness or even death in order to exercise their constitutional right, this common-sense solution should be available to all Americans.
And beyond the current coronavirus crisis, the state of voting rights is in a crisis itself, with persistent, pernicious efforts at disenfranchisement, especially toward people of color — a disgrace at any time, but especially now, amid nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd and the nationwide mourning for Lewis.
Many Democratic lawmakers have embraced the idea of renaming the voting-rights bill the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020. ""That's the way to do it,"" Rep. James Clyburn, D.-S.C., said on CNN on Sunday. Clyburn, a Black lawmaker who has built upon the bravery of Lewis, added that ""words may be powerful, but deeds are lasting.""
Powerful words from two previous presidents — one Republican, one Democrat — speak to the need for deeds to continue. Former President George W. Bush said in a statement that ""America can best honor John's memory by continuing his journey toward liberty and justice for all.""
America ""is a constant work in progress,"" former President Barack Obama said in a statement. ""What gives each new generation purpose is to take up the unfinished work of the last and carry it further — to speak out for what's right, to challenge an unjust status quo, and to imagine a better world.""
Thanks to Lewis, Obama concluded, ""we now all have our marching orders — to keep believing in the possibility of remaking this country we love until it lives up to its full promise.""
America will not achieve its full promise unless it ensures voting rights. It should do so in a bill rightfully renamed for Lewis, which would truly honor a man who seemed to stand as tall as that banner in Atlanta."
"July 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/thinking-about-a-post-trump-gop/571847591/,StarTribune,Thinking about a post-Trump GOP,"By the end of this week it will be a hundred days until the 2020 election, and it sure seems like President Donald Trump is in big trouble. FiveThirtyEight has Joe Biden with a pretty large lead — and the Post-ABC poll has him with an even larger lead. The Upshot’s Nate Cohn notes that Biden’s lead is larger than any presidential race has seen in the last quarter-century. The Economist projects a 93% chance Trump loses the electoral college and a 99% chance he loses the popular vote. Even GOP donors are beginning to pivot away from Trump and toward protecting the GOP majority in the Senate.
Can Trump be reelected in November? Sure, it’s possible! But with each day the coronavirus pandemic persists and Trump flails, the probability of a turnaround seems less likely. The likelihood that Trump will bring down other Republicans running for office must also be considered.
Let’s assume this outcome for a second — what does it mean for the GOP? Politics is a coldblooded game, and even before Trump has been declared a political dead man walking, speculation is beginning about what comes after. Commentary’s Noah Rothman recently observed, “The post-Trump era could begin sooner than many expect, and it would serve Republicans to prepare accordingly.”
Some are preparing by jumping ship. Steve Peoples of the Associated Press reports that former Ohio GOP governor John Kasich will speak in support of Biden at the Democratic National Convention: “Kasich is among a handful of high-profile Republicans likely to become more active in supporting Biden in the fall.”
Similarly, the Republicans who have joined the NeverTrump movement seem willing to burn their party ID cards. In an interview with the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent, Lincoln Project co-founder John Weaver confirmed that, “The group is preparing to vehemently oppose efforts by GOP senators to obstruct and stymie Biden’s agenda, should he win the presidency.”
If Trump’s apostates have left the party for good, what does that mean for a post-Trump GOP? Rothman suggests that if Trump gets pasted in November, the party will inevitably spurn him as well: “There will be a reckoning with the conditions that led the GOP to sacrifice most of the gains they made during eight years of Barack Obama ... . [I]f history is any guide, one-term presidents do not escape their party’s censure no matter the conditions that led to their defenestration from the Oval Office.”
This is one possibility, and would frankly be the most encouraging one. It is true that after George H.W. Bush lost, the GOP became the party it is today, one largely dedicated to not compromising. A Trump loss — particularly if the loss is so large that he takes down the Senate majority as well — could lead to serious self-reflection.
There are reasons to be doubtful, however. Even if Trump crashes and burns, his cult of personality will command significant loyalty from his MAGA base. That alone is enough to influence party primaries that in turn influence the party’s future leaders.
Furthermore, the degree to which Trumpists have permeated the entire GOP infrastructure has been underestimated. On Monday the Texas GOP, the country’s largest state Republican Party, elected former Florida congressman and current bigot Allen West to be its party chair. According to the Texas Tribune’s Patrick Svitek, “West rallied delegates against what he said was the ‘tyranny that we see in the great state of Texas, where we have executive orders and mandates, people telling us what we can and cannot do, who is essential, who is not essential.’ ” The Texas GOP is hardly the only right-leaning institution that has prostrated itself before Trumpist ideals to retain its relevancy.
Perhaps this infrastructure pivots in a post-Trump world. That would require, however, concerted action from activists and donors. Their fecklessness over the past four years is hardly reassuring on that front.
Bloomberg News’s Tyler Cowen offers some thoughts about what the post-Trump GOP would look like: “In the coming years, three things will dominate the attention of the intellectual right: the main international rival (China), the main domestic rival (the left), and the main thing they stare at all day long (the internet).” Cowen thinks this looks different from Trump, but it sounds awfully Trumpy to me.
The scary thing about a post-Trump GOP is the prospect that it learns nothing. After getting pasted in 2006 and 2008, the GOP adopted an obstructionist posture during the Obama years. The more disaffected voters were during the Great Recession, the better this strategy worked. It is all too conceivable that the post-Trump GOP changes itself not at all. It can count on the vagaries of partisan politics in the United States to eventually inherit political power once again."
"July 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-s-return-to-coronavirus-briefings/571854011/,StarTribune,Trump's return to coronavirus briefings,"After his off-the-cuff (and the rails) comments at his coronavirus press briefings backfired, President Donald Trump quit the regular dais appearances in April, stating that they were ""not worth the time and effort.""
He was right about that — at least the way he was conducting them.
Had he chosen to truly lead the country out of the COVID-19 crisis, the briefings would have in fact been valuable. But instead of steady discourse and deference to Dr. Anthony Fauci and other medical experts, the president did most of the talking, and often what he said was wrong and potentially dangerous.
On Monday, Trump announced that he would begin the briefings anew. But his justification suggested more a political than public health motive.
""I was doing them and we had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television,"" Trump said. ""There's never been anything like it.""
He's correct about the unusual nature of his earlier appearances, but his focus on ratings reflects a desperation to get back in front of voters. Almost as an aside, Trump added Monday that the briefings are ""a great way to get information out to the public"" on vaccines and therapeutics. That's true. But the nation would be better served if the president would yield to experts such as Fauci and avoid turning the briefings into brag sessions about how good a job he's done.
First, it's not true. The pandemic is raging, and America's shambolic response is a global embarrassment. Second, the public isn't buying it, as scores of polls show low voter approval of his handling of the matter.
In his Tuesday comeback, Trump struck a more serious tone and did say Americans should wear masks when social distancing isn't possible. But he continued focusing on China and defending his response. Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx did not appear.
Because the president seems to view his public appearances as a TV host might, he should understand why viewers eventually tuned out in April. Like any TV show, all talk and no action (or, in this case, results) won't hold an audience."
"July 21, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/minn-officials-encouraged-as-long-term-care-deaths-drop-tenfold/571851391/,StarTribune,Deaths in Minnesota long-term care drop tenfold,"The deaths in long-term care facilities that fueled the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota have dropped tenfold since the state launched an aggressive testing and staffing plan to protect workers and residents.
Gov. Tim Walz and state health officials acknowledged shortcomings in their initial response to COVID-19 outbreaks in these vulnerable facilities — which were exacerbated by a lack of federal emergency support and supplies — but said on Tuesday that the state has learned from those early experiences about how to protect them.
At a peak of the pandemic in mid-May, 23 facilities were reporting new outbreaks every day of at least one case of the infectious disease. Now, that rate is 6 per day. The state lost 137 long-term care residents to COVID-19 deaths in the third week of May, compared with 13 last week.
“The clear majority of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Minnesota have no current identified COVID cases,” said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner. “These facilities are safer today than they were at the beginning of the pandemic.”
The state’s “hard won lessons,” as Malcolm described them, came at a cost.
Among the 1,548 COVID-19 deaths in Minnesota, 1,189 involved residents of long-term care facilities. That includes one of three deaths reported Tuesday.
The state on Tuesday also reported 352 more lab-confirmed cases — bringing the case count to 47,457 — and that the number of Minnesotans currently hospitalized for COVID-19 had increased to 266.
Walz commended state long-term care facilities for reducing the spread of COVID-19 but said challenges remain for them and the state as a whole. More cases and deaths in this population are likely, he added, given the rising mortality risk of COVID-19 cases with age.
The governor said an announcement would likely be coming Wednesday or Thursday regarding a mask mandate in Minnesota.
If instituted, it would join 28 states and numerous cities and retailers that have made such a move.
Based on the latest data supporting the protective benefits, Walz said, widespread mask use in Minnesota — regardless of a mandate — could lead to the further reopening of business and community activities and the resumption of in-school classes in the fall.
An announcement on school reopening plans will come next week.
Walz said people can already go to cafes, work in most offices, play golf, and watch their kids play sports, and that mask-wearing would get the state to the next phase.
“If we wear masks and social distance, we can do all of those things in addition to getting kids back in school,” said Walz, noting that even a hesitant President Donald Trump tweeted this week that mask-wearing was “patriotic.”
Asymptomatic spread
Minnesota still has the 18th-highest COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 people among states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID Data Tracker, due largely to the early-spring surge in outbreaks in long-term care facilities.
Wisconsin and Iowa are seeing more rapid growth in COVID-19 cases — and both stayed on New York’s travel restriction list on Tuesday even as Minnesota was removed. But their overall COVID-19 death rates remain lower than the rate in Minnesota, where some advocates were loath to celebrate the recent progress as a result.
“The governor didn’t have a plan and only got a plan when the number of deaths was huge,” said Sen. Karin Housley, the Republican chairwoman of a Senate committee on family and aging. “No one should be patting themselves on the back.”
The COVID-19 risk to long-term care residents was apparent at the outset of the pandemic in the U.S., which started in February with an outbreak at a nursing home in Washington state where 35 people died.
Preparations in Minnesota were hindered early by confusion over the amount of personal protective equipment — such as masks and gowns — that would be coming from the federal national stockpile, Malcolm said.
“It wasn’t well until late April … that we got a very small allocation,” she said. “To our surprise and our deep dismay, we were told that was it and we weren’t going to get any more.”
State officials consequently conserved supplies for hospitals that anticipated large numbers of cases, despite shortages in long-term care facilities.
Health officials also didn’t initially recognize how easily the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was spread by people before symptoms emerged. Many workers with asymptomatic cases consequently infected residents in their care without knowing it.
Turning point
Michelle Solwold, health care administrator at the Good Samaritan Society in Brainerd, recalled how rapidly the virus spread in her 85-bed facility this spring. After two rounds of testing, the facility discovered infections among 32 residents and 29 workers.
State intervention that brought in a dozen nurses from the Federal Emergency Management Agency kept the facility open, she said.
“We were running truly an ICU in our long-term care unit, and it’s because of those FEMA nurses that we survived — that we didn’t sink,” she said.
Daily state COVID-19 death reports showed a three- to fourfold difference in early May between the high number of deaths in long-term care and the low number in people living in their own homes. That gap closed entirely last week because of declines in long-term care deaths.
Walz’s five-point plan in early May to improve safety in long-term care facilities was a turning point, Malcolm said, especially the commitment to conduct universal COVID-19 diagnostic testing of all residents and staff in any facility with a confirmed case.
Medical personnel from the Minnesota National Guard conducted many of the screenings, though that responsibility is now being transferred to other health care providers in the state.
Some large nursing homes were so short on supplies in April that they put out calls for donated masks and converted graduation gowns or rain ponchos to turn them into makeshift protective gear. Some workers stayed home because the lack of staffing and supplies had them fearing for their safety.
State health officials recruited corporate leaders to use their purchasing power and connections to secure more supplies for Minnesota, which was able to divert more equipment to long-term care facilities once the needs in hospitals were better understood.
Malcolm said in the week of June 15-23 alone, the state sent 11,000 gowns, 716,000 gloves, 28,000 faceshields and 57,000 N95 medical-grade masks to long-term care facilities.
Staffing shortages have been addressed with the help of 1,100 health care professionals in Minnesota who volunteered to cover shifts at long-term care facilities where workers were out sick, Malcolm said.
‘Come a long way’
Progress in containing the virus in long-term care is evident at Jones-Harrison Residence, a large senior care community in south Minneapolis.
In early June, 18 senior residents at Jones-Harrison were sickened by the virus. As of Tuesday, only two were still quarantined on the facility’s COVID-19 wing, and they may be cleared to leave this week, said Chantal Peterson, campus administrator at Jones-Harrison.
“We’ve come a long way,” she said. “But it’s going to take constant vigilance to stay in front of this.”
After a prolonged lockdown, Jones-Harrison will be joining other facilities across the state in allowing residents to visit indoors with family members and other essential caregivers.
The mood was already festive outdoors on Tuesday afternoon, though, as several families showed up to meet their loved ones amid the gated and flowered patios.
Christie Lord, 71, of Minneapolis, arrived with a package of new socks and a yellow rose for her longtime partner, Pamela Palmer, 71, who lives in the memory care unit.
The first time the couple met like this, after a four-month lockdown, they gazed into each other’s eyes for at least 10 minutes before they each teared up and began to talk.
“It was like a miracle, like she had risen from the dead,” Lord said.
Such face-to-face meetings have gained new meaning, Lord said, after the “dark days” of the lockdown, when so many people were dying from COVID-19 in senior homes that the couple was unsure they would ever see each other again. Lord said she would drive by the facility and wave at Palmer from her car.
“I feel proud of everyone who fought this virus,” she said, “and helped get us through the nightmare.”"

Both reported that conditions improved in June, but also said the rest of the year will continue to be bumpy.
Pump and spray equipment maker Graco, which supplies factories and paint stores and contractors, reported sales of $366.9 million for April, May and June, down 14% from the same period a year ago. Net income was down 67% to $28.8 million, or 17 cents a share.
Patrick McHale, Graco's chief executive, said despite the short-term dip — which was better than predicted by Wall Street analysts — the company will continue to invest in new products and growth initiatives.
That way, he told analysts in a conference call, the Minneapolis-based company will be ready when the economy emerges from the recession.
""We used a similar approach during the 2008-2009 crisis and our investors were subsequently rewarded and we look to repeat this again,"" McHale said.
Still, he said, Graco will need to be agile because the ""timing and shape"" of an economic recovery remains uncertain.
So far, the company has been able to navigate both the economic and health conditions caused by the pandemic to keep its major factories and distribution centers fully operational.
""High-risk employees remained at home, and we've dealt with the positive COVID-19 cases that we have experienced at various facilities without disruption,"" McHale said. ""By reducing our use of temporary labor in certain factories and flexing our workforce to areas of greater need, we've largely been able to survive the quarter without resorting to layoffs or pay reductions.""
The industrial business continues to be troublesome for Graco, with automotive and the oil and gas sectors weak worldwide.
But its contractor business, which includes residential sales in paint stores, has rebounded since April, first with home and small-scale paint sprayers and other products. The professional, larger products had a smaller uptick in sales.
McHale wonders if ""work-from-home"" has made homeowners concentrate on more DIY projects.
""There's lots of paint sprayers being sold right now. And if you took a look at our mix [it] tends towards the smaller units at the present time rather than the large units that we might sell to say a municipality or something like that,"" McHale said.
Whatever the motivation, more first-time buyers are choosing paint sprayers for spruce-ups.
Graco shares were up 4.2% to $54.46 Thursday.
The home market also lifted Pentair's overall results.
Results for the water treatment company, based in the United Kingdom but run out of Golden Valley, were dragged down by its industrial segment. Residential-pool treatment, the company said, picked up in May and more so in June.
Sales for the quarter were down 11% to $713.3 million. Net income was down 37% to $72.1 million, or 43 cents a share.
""Our industrial businesses have been negatively impacted by a pause in capital spending globally, and our commercial businesses have also been negatively impacted by delays from customers,"" said CEO John Stauch.
The majority of the company's sales are now in the residential-pool and water-quality market, and revenue in that area was down 8% for the quarter. Stauch said about 30 to 40% of in-ground pools now have variable speed pumps, but new regulations that take effect in a year will lead to more homeowners installing them — opening up an already healthy market.
Pentair shares were little changed Thursday, closing at $42.44."

It further predicts a decline in per capita income of 3.6%, bringing with it the threat of starvation to millions of the world’s poorest people. While the June jobs report in the U.S. was surprisingly good, with an unprecedented 4.8 million new jobs being added, the subsequent dramatic resurgence of the virus has led again to pessimism about the economy, as Congress begins work on another trillion-plus-dollar relief package to try to prop up the economy.
But whatever passes, a period of acute economic hardship, potentially reaching catastrophic levels in some parts of the world, certainly seems to be inevitable. What will be the long-term effects? A historical perspective yields an unexpected insight into the question of the economic consequences of pandemics.
Since the Black Death of the mid-14th century, no major pandemic appears to have had a long-lasting, negative economic impact, at least in Europe and North America. In fact, pandemics scarcely register in the standard economic histories, let alone get identified as major turning points. Even the Black Death, which may have killed a third of the world’s population in about five years, did not lead to a protracted period of economic hardship.
Of course, such a demographic collapse had far-reaching economic consequences, but not all of them were negative. While landlords and employers had difficulties finding workers, serfs and wage laborers could bargain for better pay and working conditions. The Black Death actually initiated a shift from a stagnant economy, periodically culled by famine, plague or war, to a dynamic market economy, employing labor-saving technology and using late marriage as a form of birth control. In Italy, where Florence lost 50% of its population, the pandemic did nothing to stop the Renaissance, a cultural and intellectual movement but one based solidly on the prosperity of the Italian city-states.
After the Black Death, the bubonic plague revisited Europe regularly for about 3½ centuries. Yet none of these epidemics, which were often quite lethal locally, had any long-term negative economic consequences. The most famous of them, the Great London Plague of 1665, which killed close to one-fifth of the population and was memorably described both by Daniel Defoe and Samuel Pepys, was barely a hiccup on London’s ascent to being the hegemonic trading and financial center of Europe and the world. The standard account mentions the psychological, medical and literary impact of the plague but does not indicate any long-term negative economic consequences. As historian Carlo M. Cipolla explains, “From a purely economic point of view, war was a much greater evil than the plague … plague destroyed people, but not capital, and those who survived the onslaught of the disease usually found themselves in more favorable economic conditions.”
Quarantines and forcible segregation of the sick helped Europeans domesticate the plague, reducing its economic impact. Other public health measures did the same for smallpox and cholera. Smallpox devastated the New World in the wake of Christopher Columbus, and in 18th-century Europe, it supplanted the plague as the continent’s major killer. But even before Edward Jenner invented vaccination in 1796, it did not derail the Industrial Revolution, and after vaccination was widely adopted, smallpox declined sharply. “King Cholera” hit Europe and North America in the 19th century, sowing fear and panic, but after John Snow discovered that cholera was waterborne, the construction of sewers allowed urbanization to proceed unimpeded.
The flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919 killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide, with the majority dying in fall 1918. If the higher estimate were correct, that would mean that about 5% of the world’s population died within weeks, making the 1918 flu pandemic the most lethal pandemic since the Black Death. The United States alone suffered six times the number of fatalities it recorded in World War I. The wish to prosecute the war caused the Allies to neglect quarantine measures in troop encampments, on troop ships and in shipyards, resulting in many more deaths than otherwise would have occurred.
Yet, once again, war caused far more economic hardship than disease. The temporary recessions in 1920 were caused by the need to readjust from wartime to peacetime production, to recapture markets and so on, and not to the sudden disappearance of perhaps 5% of the population. There soon followed the Roaring Twenties in America and, belatedly, in Europe. One of the standard economic histories of the postwar period mentions the 1918 flu pandemic only in passing, claiming it had very little effect other than perhaps reducing unemployment in the following decade. A major study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis concludes that most of the evidence indicates that the “economic effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic were short-term.”
These examples are admittedly skewed toward Europe and North America, where we have the best medical and economic data. In other parts of the world, where the medical infrastructure was less developed, both the morbidity rate and the economic consequences may well have been more severe. One recent study of the AIDS pandemic, for example, asserts that it reduced average national economic growth rates across Africa by 2 to 4% a year.
Still, the historical record in the 6½ centuries since the Black Death, at least in Europe and North America, suggests that the long-term economic effects of pandemics have been insignificant. The reason for this is a mystery: Partly, it may be because plagues, as Cipolla suggests, kill people but not capital; partly, it may be because life is better for survivors. But this should not be seen as a prediction of the coronavirus pandemic’s economic consequences.
There is ample evidence that the short-term economic effects will be severe, although it is mere conjecture to know whether these consequences will endure. But even if they do, even if the coronavirus is the anomaly among pandemics in this respect, the more interesting question would be to ask: Why? Would it be because of the greater integration of the world economy? Or would it be because of the greater importance of the service sector?
Or would it be because the world today, at least the developed world, can no longer abide a high level of fatalities from infectious disease? With the announcement of the eradication of smallpox in 1980, many had hoped that “The Age of Disease” was over. Even after the advent of AIDS, we view deaths from an infectious disease of a large number of people over a short period as a scandal. Perhaps the evolution of our attitude toward death means we are more willing to suffer economic hardship than to endure the sight of corpses piling up unburied, as was common during the 1918 influenza pandemic."
"July 24, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/schafer-here-s-why-the-600-weekly-jobless-benefit-meant-so-much-to-the-u-s-economy/571895782/,StarTribune,Here's why the $600 weekly jobless benefit meant so much to the U.S. economy,"An additional $600 per week of federal unemployment benefits has been a blessing to those who lost a job as the coronavirus pandemic began crushing the economy last spring.
It was also a generous deal, at least for many. Roughly two-thirds of the many millions who lost paid work could have easily seen a boost in their incomes as unemployment benefits kicked in.
Now, the $600 weekly benefit has ended. Even if Congress and the White House decided to continue the benefit, odds are slim it remains $600 per week.
Maybe $600 was too much, although picking a better number doesn’t seem to be an easy task. One thing we have learned since March is that getting money to low-wage workers who lost their job is pretty smart, if keeping the economy healthier really is important.
Like a lot of other aspects of the government’s response to the virus, a beefed-up unemployment benefit in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was viewed as a short-term measure. Yet unlike every other high-income country, the new COVID-19 cases daily in the U.S. lately has easily exceeded the number of new cases this spring.
As of last week, the United States had 141 cases per 100,000 people over the previous seven days, according to the New York Times. That’s nearly six times as many as in Spain and about 16 times that of Canada.
Given that, it’s hardly surprising that of the thousands of businesses reported as closed on Yelp’s site as of earlier this month, well over half were then permanently closed, up 14 percentage points since June. The latest number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits, a whopping big number again, just showed an increase from the previous week, too.
Aside from the virus causing people to stay home, it also could be that the economic pain is still spreading out from the parts of the economy first battered by the pandemic. That means what we’re going through is starting to look a little more like a “normal” recession, with broad declines in demand leading to more lost jobs.
It’s important to understand that unemployment insurance was not really meant to be a dollar-for-dollar replacement. It’s kind of like car insurance with a big deductible: it’s a help but it doesn’t make the policyholder whole. Minnesota’s system provides about half of the old paycheck.
The initial goal of these programs back in the 1930s was simply keeping families afloat, not to stimulate demand. But unemployment insurance turned out to be great for stabilizing the economy, building up money in good years and spending it when the economy goes south.
The original idea behind the federal government’s extra unemployment benefit was to completely replace the income of workers who were either temporarily furloughed or laid off. The weekly $600, combined with benefits under state law, worked out to be a full replacement of wages at the average American wage of about $30 an hour.
This turned out to be another case, though, where citing the “average” wage turns out to be misleading. It’s a little like Jeff Bezos joining a neighborhood book club, and someone then noting that on average members are a bunch of billionaires.
The median wage — half earning under that number and half over — is far lower than the average wage, which means that there’s a lot more lower-wage workers that high-paid ones. Even in high-wage Minnesota the median wage is only about $21.50 per hour.
Back-of-the-envelope math shows how with the additional $600, the break-even with working came out to be a wage of about $30 per hour.
If a worker had earned far less than that, the $600 weekly federal benefit combined with the state’s benefit proved to be much better than working. At the current minimum wage for smaller employers now in effect in Minneapolis of $11.75 an hour, the total UI benefits exceeded wages by almost 80%.
If that doesn’t seem fair, remember the effects of the virus haven’t exactly been fair either.
By the end of May, employment rates for low-wage workers in Minnesota were down about 35% from January, as of the latest data presented by Opportunity Insights, a research and policy group started by economists at Harvard University and Brown University.
An even more interesting story is told by consumer spending. Spending across the board rolled off the table in March and April as much of Minnesota’s economy shut down, and then mostly recovered, but at different rates depending on income.
Consumer spending for the state is still down about 4.6% as of the middle of July, but spending for higher income consumers hasn’t recovered as much.
These numbers do not explain exactly why behavior might be different depending on how much a worker gets paid. It seems likely, though, that the kind of in-person entertainment and services well-paid people routinely spent a lot of their money maybe hasn’t really been available as the pandemic continues.
But for low-wage people, the rate of spending has all but recovered to January’s level, although it dipped a bit recently.
Since this spring, the wonks and forecasters have been talking about a hoped-for economic recovery in the shape of a V, a quick bounceback in activity as the worst of the pandemic passes. The reality so far is not convincing.
An exception is consumer spending by low-wage workers, and given the extent of the job losses it’s no mystery how that’s even been possible. What happens to consumer spending if the additional unemployment money from the federal government is no longer coming?
There are a lot of needs this year competing for the attention of policymakers in Washington. But in this case we can pretty safely assume that low-wage workers looking for work won’t be able to spend the money they won’t have."
"July 26, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-officials-float-idea-of-narrow-bill-to-extend-unemployment-benefits/571914172/,StarTribune,Trump officials float idea of narrow bill to extend unemployment benefits,"Top Trump administration officials proposed Sunday potentially short circuiting free-ranging stimulus talks with Democrats to rush through a much narrower bill prioritizing an extension of federal jobless benefits that are set to expire this week for millions of Americans.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said that he would like to see lawmakers act this week to extend and alter the unemployment program, give tax credits to businesses to help ease reopening costs and grant employers new liability protections — while setting aside a long list of other objectives, including Democrats' priorities.
""Perhaps we put that forward, get that passed, as we can negotiate on the rest of the bill in the weeks to come,"" Meadows said on ABC.
The proposal, echoed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in his own Sunday TV interview, was a last-ditch effort by Republicans to prevent the program from lapsing as signs mounted that the nation's economy was once again weakening amid a resurgence of coronavirus cases. But as they prepared to roll out their own more expansive relief legislation Monday, it amounted to a concession that Republicans, slowed by their own internal divisions, were unlikely to reach a deal on a comprehensive relief package with Democrats before millions begin losing a $600-a-week benefit that has helped contain the economic carnage.
With Democrats already on record in opposition to a piecemeal approach, a narrow fix is almost certainly dead on arrival. Republicans know that, suggesting their Sunday proposal may in part be a negotiating tactic laying the groundwork to blame the opposition party when the funds ultimately expire.
Democrats passed their own $3 trillion proposal — which also includes money to bail out states and cities, fully fund the $600 federal jobless benefit and infuse billions more into the nation's health care system — in May and view the time pinch now as a problem of Republicans' making that only gives them more leverage in shaping a final bill.
""We've been anxious to negotiate for two months and 10 days,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday on CBS. She said Congress could not leave town for its annual August recess until a deal is struck and noted that she spent the weekend waiting to hear from the other party to begin talks.
""This is an emergency,"" Pelosi added. ""Maybe they don't understand. I don't know what they have against working families in America to keep this going so long.""
In addition to a difference in negotiating strategy, the two sides have very different views about how to handle even the narrow set of issues identified by the White House. Republicans are proposing altering the jobless benefit program to replace the $600 flat weekly payments with a plan to replace about 70% of a worker's lost wages — a change Democrats are unlikely to endorse. And Democrats strongly oppose an effort by Republicans to give many employers new protections from lawsuits from their workers, patients or students.
In addition to the jobless change and liability protections, the GOP legislation is expected to include $105 billion for schools and billions of dollars more for testing, contact tracing and vaccine distribution. Some of the education funds would be reserved for elementary and secondary schools reopening and bringing students back to a more traditional, in-person setting.
The bill is likely to provide for another round of stimulus checks to American families, though it remains unclear who would be eligible to receive those payments. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said Sunday that the checks would be worth $1,200, though he did not detail who precisely would receive them."

Economically, that is.","Everything about SARS-CoV-2 seems unfair. It afflicts the poor worse than the rich, and Blacks more than whites. It also disrupts — and potentially derails — the lives of people in some generations more than others. There's social and political dynamite in this inequity. One likely effect is to make several developed countries swerve left politically, toward some bowdlerized form of ""socialism.""
The generational effects of COVID-19 may seem counterintuitive. Medically, the virus is most life-threatening to the so-called ""silent generation"" of people in their late 70s, 80s or 90s. But economically, the coronavirus has left these lives relatively unscathed. Their careers have been had, their retirement savings — if they had any — had already been turned into annuities. The Silents as a group are not the pandemic's biggest economic losers.
Nor is the generation just behind them, the infamous baby boomers now in their late 50s, 60s or early 70s. They've raised their children and don't have the stress of home-schooling them during lockdowns. Most are still earning and saving or are just entering retirement with relatively generous pensions. Best of all, they've been politically in control for so long, they've molded entire welfare and tax systems to their advantage.
My own cohort, the generation X of people in their 40s and early 50s, will also be fine overall. Yes, we're currently traversing the nadir of the so-called U-curve of lifetime well-being, as we feel the midlife stress of caring simultaneously for elderly parents and vulnerable children — the same ones who nowadays share our home offices to Zoom with their teachers. But that aside, we Xers had a fair shot at building our careers in the booming 90s and — following the blip of the dot-com bust — the aughts. We're less worried about ourselves than about the long-term effects of school closures on our children, called generation Z.
So it's really the folks in their 20s and 30s, the generation between X and Z, we should spare a thought for. Logically, they should be called generation Y, but because they came of age near a round-number year they're the millennials. And boy, do they keep getting shafted.
It started with the financial crash of 2008, which hit just as the millennials were hoping to enter the job market and start their careers. Suddenly, all the good jobs were gone, and they were more likely to be and stay unemployed than the older generations.
Studies show that even a decade after the crash, all but the most educated millennials were earning and saving less than Xers or boomers did at the same age. Lower entry-level salaries can have consequences (""wage scars"") that last an entire life time. This precarious outlook is probably one reason why millennials had already been delaying marriage and children longer than preceding generations did, and are more likely to still be living with (gasp) their parents.
And then this coronavirus showed up, causing a downturn that's making the ""Great Recession"" of 2008 seem almost mild. After that previous labor-market trauma, a lot of millennials took whatever gigs they could find — as bartenders, baristas, waiters or contract workers. But these are exactly the types of jobs that fell away during the lockdowns and may not come back soon.
So millennials have a right to be frustrated. But what makes many of them irate is watching the older generations milk the system at their expense, through what some economists call ""boomer socialism.""
Consider the generous but unsustainable public pensions going to boomers in most developed countries, which are paid for largely by millennials and Xers. In the U.S., there's also health care that's universal and public for the old (called Medicare) but often unavailable or unaffordable for the young. In many countries, the boomers have also bid up house prices beyond the reach of millennials, in part with tax breaks for mortgage interest that disproportionately benefit older taxpayers. Oh, and there's the mountain of student-loan debt bearing down on many American millennials.
This distress, coupled with the hypocrisy of boomers who claim to oppose big government while enjoying it in so many ways, explains why millennials have been trending left and even embracing the loaded word ""socialism."" It's these fed-up young voters who boosted the campaigns of lefty boomer populists like Bernie Sanders in the U.S. and Jeremy Corbyn in the U.K.
Whether millennials actually use the word ""socialism"" properly — as government ownership of the means of production — is moot. More likely, they simply want better public policy that addresses their specific problems. Even then, however, they often fall prey to political snake oil such as rent controls or wealth taxes.
The better path for policymakers across the West is to offer more pragmatic, but still sufficiently bold, alternatives. And as I've argued, this means reviving classical liberalism — not in the American sense of ""left"" but in the European sense of ""freedom.""
Health care, for example, can be provided publicly, privately or in a mixed system like Germany's; but it should always be universal. Pension reform is a no-brainer. So is tax simplification that cuts loopholes for boomers, thus broadening the base without necessarily raising rates. And yes, we should keep studying the idea, still never properly tried, of a universal basic income — not to expand, but to replace the welfare state.
It would be tragic if we survived the pandemic only to find ourselves living in true socialism, which in practice has always robbed societies of prosperity and individuals of freedom. To avoid that fate, all generations should offer millennials a fairer — a liberal — deal."
"July 27, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-seeks-political-shot-in-the-arm-in-vaccine-push/571922352/,StarTribune,Trump seeks political shot in the arm in vaccine push,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic put his political fate in grave jeopardy. Now he's hoping to get credit for his administration's aggressive push for a vaccine -– and crossing his fingers that one gets approved before Election Day.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited vaccine development sites on Monday, marking the beginning of the largest COVID-19 vaccine research trial yet. Their trips to North Carolina and Florida, respectively, come as the White House is grappling with its most prominent virus case since the crisis began and a nationwide spike in the outbreak that threatens to undermine an economic rebound. White House officials say a vaccine is necessary to fully restore a sense of normalcy.
""I heard very positive things,"" Trump said, when asked about the timetable for bringing a vaccine to market, ""but by the end of the year we think we're in very good shape to be doing that.""
Trump's standing in the polls, trailing former Vice President Joe Biden less than 100 days before the election, underscores the urgency to highlight vaccines and therapeutics –- which include the antiviral drug remdesivir and convalescent plasma.
The economic toll of the pandemic has undone the job gains of Trump's presidency and his administration has faced bipartisan criticism for its handling of efforts to test and contain the outbreak. Trump aides view the hunt for the vaccine as something they can still get right.
Privately, many White House officials have pinned their reelection hopes on the potential emergence of a vaccine for the coronavirus, believing it to be the ultimate ""October surprise."" Some believe Trump may well be doomed without one, and that even with one, it may be too late to save his fortunes with so many Americans expected to vote before Election Day on Nov. 3.
Under the federal government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, multiple COVID-19 vaccines are being developed simultaneously with a goal of delivering 300 million safe and effective doses by January 2021.
Trump was visiting the FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies' Innovation Center in Morrisville, a suburb of Raleigh. The facility has begun production of the first batch of a possible vaccine developed by Novavax, a Maryland company.
The batches produced at the North Carolina facility will be used in a Phase 3 clinical trial of up to 30,000 subjects, which is expected to begin this fall and will determine the drug's safety and effectiveness, according to Novavax, which received $1.6 billion from the federal government under Operation Warp Speed.
The president is working to highlight progress in the development of a vaccine before voters go to the polls in about three months. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has said he is cautiously optimistic that one and maybe more vaccines will be available by the end of this year.
""The ultimate goal of this would be to get full licensure based on clear-cut efficacy and safety data,"" Fauci told reporters Monday.
Peter Navarro, a senior Trump economic adviser, framed the effort as a political home run for Trump, who pushed for development of the vaccine while simultaneously working on a process to distribute it quickly.
But even as Trump has tried to shift the nation's focus from new infections to hope for cures, he's been interrupted by rising case loads across the Sunbelt and word Monday that Robert O'Brien, his national security adviser, has tested positive for the virus.
The political imperative for Trump has sparked concerns among members of Congress that Trump could try to take shortcuts in the approval process. Administration experts have dismissed those concerns, and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said Monday, ""We must maintain confidence of the American people in the scientific process.""
Hahn joined Pence in Miami to highlight the beginning of Phase 3 testing of a different vaccine candidate developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., which began its first injections Monday.
""It's a historic day, a day when we begin in earnest to work on a vaccine,"" Pence said.
""We want to ensure we move at a safe and effective pace. I want to assure the people of Florida and people all across this country that we will cut no corners in the development of this or any vaccine,"" Pence added.
About 4.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in the United States and there have been more than 146,000 deaths.
With the election approaching, Trump has begun to run short on time to shift the narrative of the race, which so far appears shaping up to be as a referendum on his handling of the pandemic. He faces deficits in battleground states across the map, has struggled to land attacks on Biden and has been forced by the virus to scrap rallies and GOP convention events, moments he might have used to change the momentum of the contest.
Instead, White House aides seem to be growing more resigned to hoping for an outside event to change the trajectory of the contest, whether a serious misstep by Biden or, increasingly, a vaccine breakthrough. North Carolina is a key battleground state in the coming election, and Trump's visit marks his 10th trip to the state during his presidency. Trump won the state by nearly 4 percentage points in 2016.
The state's importance was reflected in the party's plans to hold its nominating convention in Charlotte, before Trump moved the event to Florida, only to later cancel those plans as well. Instead, a small subset of GOP delegates will formally renominate Trump on Aug. 24 in Charlotte at an event scheduled to last just four hours."
"July 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/here-s-how-trump-s-opposition-to-mail-voting-hurts-the-gop/571927262/,StarTribune,Here's how Trump's opposition to mail voting hurts the GOP,"After months of hearing Trump denigrate mail-in balloting, Republicans in the critical battleground state now find themselves far behind Democrats in the perennial push to urge their voters to cast ballots remotely. While Democrats have doubled the number of their voters who have requested mail ballots compared to 2016, Republicans have increased their numbers by about 20% since then.
The recent tally is the hard evidence confirming many Republicans' fears about Trump's tweeting about mail-in voting: GOP voters are listening and appear less likely to take advantage of what many election and health officials agree is the easiest and safest way to vote in a pandemic.
The numbers are so clear that Florida Republicans are shifting their emphasis from years past and are now trying to persuade voters to use another alternative to Election Day voting: in-person early voting.
""Did the president's tweet cause it? Maybe a little bit, but it's been shifting for years now,"" said Susie Wiles, who has been tapped by the Trump campaign to help buoy the president's newly troubled Florida campaign. ""If COVID is still the level of concern that it is now, early vote is, after absentee, probably the next best option.""
Political campaigns in both parties typically push their voters to cast ballots by mail because they can bank votes for their side in advance, freeing up scarce resources to chase down less-frequent voters and turn them out by Election Day. Amid the coronavirus, that push has become all the more urgent.
But while Democrats have tried to expand access to voting by mail, Republicans have struggled with what to tell their voters. Some have pushed for it, while Trump and his allies at the Republican National Committee have tried to limit expansion of remote voting.
Increasingly, GOP operatives and officials are voicing their concerns with that strategy. ""Why give Democrats 10 or 11 days to vote and expect Republicans to vote on one day?"" asked Rohn Bishop, Republican Party chair in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. ""It puts us at a disadvantage.""
Trump has called mail ballots ""corrupt"" and ""substantially fraudulent,"" even though the five states that now send ballots to all voters have had no signs of substantial fraud. Despite the president's objections, numerous states have loosened restrictions on mail voting amid the pandemic.
Trump's own campaign isn't heeding his warning. It continues to encourage its voters to sign up for mail ballots when possible — even as the RNC is fighting in court against Democratic efforts to further expand mail voting and issuing statements like one last week saying the expansion has led ""to delays, disaster and dysfunction.""
That's led the GOP to make some political contortions. In Florida, state Republicans recently sent a mailer urging their party members to request mail ballots. It included part of a tweet from Trump saying, ""Absentee ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your ballot.""
But the mailer did not include the rest of the president's tweet: ""Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election in USA history.""
In most states, there is no difference between absentee and mail-in voting.
Democrats are chortling. ""It's something to watch the President just torch 30 years of @FloridaGOP superiority in Florida on vote by mail with each and every tweet,"" Steve Schale, a veteran Florida Democratic operative who runs a super PAC for Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, tweeted Sunday after another Trump tweet denigrating mail ballots.
It's not just Florida where Republicans are facing a gap. In North Carolina, another swing state where the GOP once dominated absentee voting, Republicans also cherry-picked a Trump tweet in a mailer pleading with their voters to request mail ballots.
North Carolina Republicans have requested about 50% more ballots than in 2016, but Democrats have asked for a whopping seven times more absentee ballots.
In Pennsylvania, another presidential battleground, more than 1 million Democrats voted by mail in that state's June primary compared to just fewer than 400,000 Republicans, according to data from the Pennsylvania secretary of state's office.
In the Georgia primary the following week, the gap continued — Democrats outvoted Republicans by 182,000 ballots out of 2.1 million cast.
While some Republicans argue that Democrats were more motivated to vote because they had a contested presidential primary, Iowa held a primary the same month well after its February presidential caucuses. In that primary, 24% more Democrats than Republicans voted by mail, and more Democrats voted overall even though the two parties have an almost equal number of registered voters there.
In Michigan, where the Democratic secretary of state sent absentee ballot applications to all voters, Trump supporters last month set their own applications on fire.
Glen Bolger, a veteran Republican pollster, warned that his swing state polling finds a huge partisan gap in desire to vote by mail.
""Waiting for Election Day for most of your voters to cast their votes — what if there's really bad weather or long lines?"" Bolger said. ""It just makes it harder for state and local parties to do their jobs.""
Still, the lack of GOP interest in voting by mail has made Bishop worried about numerous down-ballot races in Wisconsin that depend on the presidential election driving mail ballot turnout. It's hard for Republicans to find early in-person options in his remote corner of the state, and no one knows how easy it will be to access the polls there in November.
Bishop said that after he started tweeting about the problem in May, he was told the administration wasn't happy with him, but some Wisconsin Republicans have stood by him.
""The president, how he's talked about this hasn't been very helpful,"" said Wisconsin Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke. ""The absentee ballot system here in Wisconsin is safe and responsible and should be used as much as possible during a pandemic."""

Peter Beyer, the government's coordinator for trans-Atlantic cooperation, expressed alarm in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland newspaper group.
""We are experiencing the beginning of a Cold War 2.0,"" Beyer said. He criticized both sides but said, ""the U.S. is our most important partner outside the EU, and that is how it will stay.""
FRANCE:
President Emmanuel Macron calls President Donald Trump ""my friend"" but is trying to avoid riling Beijing.
France has not echoed Trump's criticism of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus, but legislators applauded Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian last week when he condemned abuses of minority Uighurs in China's northwest.
Le Drian mentioned ""mass arrests, disappearances, forced labor, forced sterilizations, the destruction of Uighur cultural heritage."" He said France has asked that the camps be closed.
""All these practices are unacceptable,"" the minister said. ""We condemn them.""
Trump's ambivalence toward U.S. allies and flouting of diplomatic norms has alarmed France.
""Sino-American tensions don't benefit France,"" said Valerie Niquet of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a think tank. ""We share the same interests as the United States towards China, we adopt more or less the same positions, so it doesn't bring us any positive element.""
EUROPE:
Europe's ""strategic relations"" with China will be an issue for the European Union while Germany holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation bloc, Merkel said this month.
EU foreign ministers have not managed to agree on a common position on China.
Regarding Hong Kong, options include closer scrutiny of exports of sensitive technology to the territory and changing visa policies for its residents. But there is no talk of economic sanctions or targeting Chinese officials with penalties.
""The message is that the recent actions change the rules,"" said the top EU foreign policy official, Josep Borrell. ""This will require a revision of our approach and will clearly have an impact on our relations.""
SOUTH KOREA:
South Korea is squeezed between its main military ally and its biggest trading partner.
In 2016, Beijing destroyed supermarket operator Lotte's business in China after the conglomerate sold a plot of land in South Korea to the government for an anti-missile system over Chinese objections.
Washington is unhappy with South Korea's desire to ease sanctions on North Korea to encourage disarmament and uneasy about its use of Huawei technology.
Trump complains about the cost of stationing 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea to protect against North Korean threats. A cost-sharing agreement expired in 2019 without a replacement.
The U.S.-Chinese row ""has thrown a question to South Korea"" about which side to choose, the newspaper Dong-A Ilbo said in an editorial Monday.
""Sooner or later we will be forced to provide an answer, no matter how hard we tried to avoid it,"" the newspaper said.
INDIA:
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to embrace both Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump, but the pandemic and a border clash that killed at least 20 Indian soldiers have fueled anti-Chinese sentiment.
Protesters have called for boycotts of Chinese goods and burned Chinese flags. They applauded the government's ban on the popular Chinese video-sharing app TikTok and some other Chinese apps.
Washington wants stronger ties with India and supported its controversial move a year ago to split its only Muslim-majority state, restive Jammu and Kashmir, into two federally controlled territories. This month, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the United States would stand up to China on the Indian border dispute.
""For India it is opportune that the U.S. is applying more pressure on China, and if it can get it to behave, that would be welcomed by the entire neighborhood,"" said Jayadev Ranade, president of the Center for China Analysis think tank in New Delhi.
AFRICA:
China-U.S. tensions are taking a toll: The African Development Bank said last year trade disruption due to the tariff war could lead to a 2.5% drop in economic output for some African countries.
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said political disputes should be set aside to better fight the coronavirus.
""Let's not be sucked back into isolationism or unilateralism. We need each other today more than ever,"" Kenyatta said an Atlantic Council event last month. ""We're not going to fight coronavirus if one country fails and another succeeds.""
SOUTHEAST ASIA:
The 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations has avoided taking steps that would alienate Washington or Beijing, both important trading partners.
""The great powers, as they escalate their rivalry, will woo us into their side,"" said Harry Roque, a spokesman for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. ""We will advance our national interest.""
The region's most sensitive conflict — over control of the South China Sea — escalated when the Trump administration publicly rejected most of Beijing's claims to one of the world's busiest waterways.
""We are making clear: Beijing's claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a July 13 statement.
The Philippines and Vietnam, among the most vocal critics of Chinese assertiveness, could benefit from that stance but will move cautiously, said Greg Poling of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
""They aren't going to stick their necks in a noose until they see real follow-through from Washington,"" Poling said."
"July 28, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/democrats-gop-far-apart-as-virus-aid-talks-intensify/571933282/,StarTribune,"Democrats, GOP far apart on virus aid; Trump wants a deal","WASHINGTON — A day of shuttle diplomacy on Capitol Hill over a coronavirus aid package produced few results Tuesday, with stark differences between the $3 trillion proposal from Democrats and $1 trillion counteroffer from Republicans as millions of Americans' jobless benefits, school reopenings and eviction protections hang in the balance.
As top White House negotiators returned for a second day of talks, the leverage is apparent. They are meeting again in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. Republicans are so deeply divided over the prospect of big government spending that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is left with a severely weakened hand.
President Donald Trump said the Republican effort is ""semi-irrelevant"" as talks launch with Democrats.
""We want to do what's best for the people,"" Trump said at the White House.
Striking any agreement with Congress by Friday's deadline for expiring aid will be daunting. But the outcome will be a defining one for the president and the parties heading into the November election as an uneasy nation is watching and waiting for Washington to bring some end to the health crisis and devastating economic fallout.
""We cannot afford to fail,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.
Key to the debate is the $600 weekly unemployment benefit bump that is expiring for millions of jobless Americans. Republicans want to slash it to $200 a week as an incentive to push people back to work. Democrats have shown flickers of willingness to curb the federal aid but held firm in first-round talks.
Wider disputes will punctuate the discussions over money for cash-strapped states and cities, schools to prepare for fall, virus testing and billions of dollars to shore up American households and small businesses facing potential ruin as the virus rages and stay-home orders resume.
With the virus death toll climbing and 4.2 million infections nationwide, both parties are eager for relief.
But McConnell acknowledged the limits with Republicans split: ""We've done the best we can.""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows spent hours going back-and-forth between the leaders' offices at the Capitol.
McConnell set the tone by insisting that he would accept no package without a liability shield against COVID-19 lawsuits, his top priority from the start.
But he's coming to the negotiating table with half the GOP senators expected to oppose any virus relief deal, and the Democrats swiftly rebuffed his demand, telling the White House negotiators to ask if he was serious.
Pelosi called it ""liability on steroids"" — a sweeping ban on injury lawsuits — and she said McConnell ""sounded like a person who had no interest in having an agreement.""
Mnuchin and Meadows also heard an earful during a private GOP lunch.
Several senators vigorously questioned Mnuchin, Meadows and McConnell and warned against caving to liberal demands, said two Republicans who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting. Senators predicted the price tag will balloon past $1 trillion.
""It's a mess,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""I don't know what we're trying to accomplish.""
By day's end, Meadows acknowledged that talks are not ""getting closer."" The White House officials plan to return Wednesday.
The two bills are widely seen as starting points in talks.
Republicans seek $16 billion for virus testing; Democrats want $75 billion.
For school reopenings, Democrats want four times the $105 billion that Republicans propose.
Democrats want to extend a federal eviction moratorium on millions of rental units that is expiring Friday, but Republicans are silent on evictions.
While McConnell insisted on the liability shield, Democrats want tougher federal workplace safety oversight.
One major sticking point will be over funding for states and cities. Democrats proposed nearly $1 trillion to avert municipal layoffs, but Republicans prefer providing them with flexibility in previously approved aid.
An area of common ground is agreement on a new round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans earning $75,000 or less.
But Democrats also add a ""heroes' pay"" bonus for front-line workers, money for food stamps and other assistance.
Conservative Republicans quickly broke ranks, arguing the spending was too much and priorities misplaced.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said McConnell would be lucky to get half the Republicans on board.
""We're in a war, OK, with the virus,"" Graham said at the Capitol. ""If you don't think we need money for hospitals and doctors, you're not looking at the same movie I'm looking at.""
As Republicans tried to justify the White House's request for $1.7 billion to replace the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, McConnell said he opposed the provision. The building is across the street from the Trump International Hotel.
As bipartisan talks unfold, the White House has suggested a narrower relief package may be all that's possible. Democrats have dismissed that as too meager. And Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said, ""I haven't heard any support for that.""
The $600 weekly jobless benefits boost, approved as part of the March aid package, officially expires Friday, but because of the way states process unemployment payments, the cutoff has effectively begun."
"July 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/hong-kong-economy-contracts-9-in-latest-quarter/571941472/,StarTribune,Hong Kong economy contracts 9% in latest quarter,"HONG KONG — Hong Kong's economy shrank by 9% from a year earlier in the latest quarter, hurt by the coronavirus pandemic and facing more potential damage from the loss of U.S. trade privileges due to a security law imposed by Beijing.
The performance reported Wednesday for the three months ending in June was an improvement over the previous quarter's 9.1% contraction, the biggest since the government began reporting such data in the 1970s.
Hong Kong, a center for trade, finance and tourism, already was struggling before the coronavirus prompted the government to impose travel curbs and restrictions on business.
Tourist arrivals fell following protests that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy and other grievances.
The territory also faces further trouble after Washington withdrew its special trade status in response to Beijing's imposition of a security law that will tighten control over the former British colony.
The Trump administration said Hong Kong would no longer be treated as an autonomous trading area. That could result in more scrutiny of goods bound to and from the United States, eroding Hong Kong's competitive edge against mainland Chinese and other major Asian ports.
The Hong Kong government has launched stimulus programs including most recently a handout of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,290) to all adults.
Hopes for a quick economic rebound have been tempered by a recent surge in new virus infections."
"July 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-again-pushes-unproven-drug-as-covid-19-treatment/571929762/,StarTribune,Trump defends disproved COVID-19 treatment,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump issued a stout defense Tuesday of a disproved use of a malaria drug as a treatment for the coronavirus, hours after social media companies moved to take down videos promoting its use as potentially harmful misinformation.
The president, in a marked shift from the more measured approach he’s taken toward the virus in recent days, took to Twitter to promote hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and to amplify criticism of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. In a White House briefing, Trump defended his decision to promote a viral video of a group of doctors promoting the use of the drug Monday, even though his own administration withdrew emergency authorization for its use against the coronavirus.
“I think they’re very respected doctors,"" Trump said, adding they believed in the drug. ""There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it.” The doctors, members of a group called America’s Frontline Doctors, took part in an event organized by Tea Party Patriots Action, a dark money group that has helped fund a pro-Trump political action committee.
Scientific studies have shown hydroxychloroquine can do more harm than good when used to treat symptoms of COVID-19.
Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., and others shared video of the event on Facebook and Twitter, prompting both companies to step in and remove the content as part of an aggressive push to keep the sites free of potentially harmful information about the virus — though not before more than 17 million people had seen one version of the video circulating on the web.
The decision to remove the videos sparked conservative claims of “censorship,” with Simone Gold, one of the doctors, tweeting that “there are always opposing views in medicine.”
“Treatment options for COVID-19 should be debated, and spoken about among our colleagues in the medical field,” she wrote. “They should never, however, be censored and silenced.”
Others stressed the differences between medical opinion and peer-reviewed scientific studies.
Many high-quality studies have found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine, when used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, as touted many times by Trump, helps treat coronavirus infection or prevent serious disease from it. They include studies commissioned by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization and universities in the U.S. and around the world.
Because of the lack of benefit and the risks of serious side effects such as heart rhythm problems, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently revoked its brief authorization of emergency use of the drug for COVID-19. NIH treatment guidelines also specifically recommend against hydroxychloroquine’s use, except in formal studies.
In addition to sharing the video, Trump retweeted several tweets that attacked the credibility of Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force.
Later, Trump appeared to back away from his criticism of Fauci, saying, “I get along with him very well"" and even appearing envious of his widespread approval rating.
“He’s got a very good approval rating, and I like that,"" Trump said, adding that Fauci and White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx work for him, “And yet they’re highly thought of but nobody likes me.”
Fauci has become an off-and-on target of Trump and some of his White House aides and outside allies, who disagreed with the doctor's early recommendation to shut down the economy as a way to slow the virus, which is surging again in parts of the country, mostly in the South and West.
Trump, in recent interviews, has described Fauci as “a bit of an alarmist” and accused him of making “mistakes” in his coronavirus guidance. But Trump also says he gets along with the longtime head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Fauci said Tuesday that he'll deal with the attacks by keeping his head down and doing his job. He also backed the conclusions of the FDA and others about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19.
Asked if he can do his job while Trump publicly questions his credibility, Fauci said the stakes are too high not to stay involved.
“We're in the middle of a crisis with regard to an epidemic, a pandemic. This is what I do,"" Fauci said on ABC's “Good Morning America.” ""This is what I’ve been trained for my entire professional life and I’ll continue to do it.”
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube began scrubbing their sites of the video of the doctors on Monday. Conservative news outlets, groups and internet personalities shared it.
Facebook said the video is “sharing false information about cures and treatments for COVID-19,” according to spokesman Andy Stone.
Twitter also said it was working to remove the video. The company also took down a tweet from Donald Trump Jr. describing one version of the video as a “must watch!!!” and temporarily halted him from tweeting.
In the video, Dr. Stella Immanuel, a physician from Houston whom Trump described as spectacular, promotes hydroxychloroquine as a sure-fire cure for the coronavirus. She claims to have successfully treated 350 people “and counting,” including older patients and some with underlying medical conditions.
“You don’t need masks, there is a cure,” Immanuel says in the video. But in videos posted to her Facebook page, Immanuel regularly wears masks while preaching during religious events.
“I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her,"" Trump said of Immanuel, sidestepping questions about her history of dubious medical claims.
Trump initially flouted guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on wearing face masks, saying he wouldn't be doing it — and he didn't in public until this month.
After multiple polls showed the public disapproved of his handling of the coronavirus, Trump recently began encouraging people to wear face coverings and tried to project a more serious tone as the virus has surged again, primarily in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas.
Trump wore a face mask in public on Monday in North Carolina, just the second time he has done so during the pandemic.
Last week, he said the situation would probably worsen before it gets better, and he cited the virus as a reason for canceling GOP convention events scheduled for August in Jacksonville, Florida.
More than 4 million people in the U.S. have been infected by the coronavirus and the death toll is nearing 150,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University."
"July 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/misinformation-on-the-virus-is-proving-highly-contagious/571945102/,StarTribune,Misinformation on coronavirus is proving highly contagious,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. — As the world races to find a vaccine and a treatment for COVID-19, there is seemingly no antidote in sight for the burgeoning outbreak of coronavirus conspiracy theories, hoaxes, anti-mask myths and sham cures.
The phenomenon, unfolding largely on social media, escalated this week when President Donald Trump retweeted a false video about an anti-malaria drug being a cure for the virus and it was revealed that Russian intelligence is spreading disinformation about the crisis through English-language websites.
Experts worry the torrent of bad information is dangerously undermining efforts to slow the virus, whose death toll in the U.S. hit 150,000 Wednesday, by far the highest in the world, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Over a half-million people have died in the rest of the world.
Hard-hit Florida reported 216 deaths, breaking the single-day record it set a day earlier. Texas confirmed 313 additional deaths, pushing its total to 6,190, while South Carolina's death toll passed 1,500 this week, more than doubling over the past month. In Georgia, hospitalizations have more than doubled since July 1.
""It is a real challenge in terms of trying to get the message to the public about what they can really do to protect themselves and what the facts are behind the problem,"" said Michael Osterholm, head of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.
He said the fear is that ""people are putting themselves in harm's way because they don't believe the virus is something they have to deal with.""
Rather than fade away in the face of new evidence, the claims have flourished, fed by mixed messages from officials, transmitted by social media, amplified by leaders like Trump and mutating when confronted with contradictory facts.
""You don't need masks. There is a cure,"" Dr. Stella Immanuel promised in a video that promoted hydroxychloroquine. ""You don't need people to be locked down.""
The truth: Federal regulators last month revoked their authorization of the drug as an emergency treatment amid growing evidence it doesn't work and can have deadly side effects. Even if it were effective, it wouldn't negate the need for masks and other measures to contain the outbreak.
None of that stopped Trump, who has repeatedly praised the drug, from retweeting the video. Twitter and Facebook began removing the video Monday for violating policies on COVID-19 misinformation, but it had already been seen more than 20 million times.
Many of the claims in Immanuel's video are widely disputed by medical experts. She has made even more bizarre pronouncements in the past, saying that cysts, fibroids and some other conditions can be caused by having sex with demons, that McDonald's and Pokemon promote witchcraft, that alien DNA is used in medical treatments, and that half-human ""reptilians"" work in the government.
Other baseless theories and hoaxes have alleged that the virus isn't real or that it's a bioweapon created by the U.S. or its adversaries. One hoax from the outbreak's early months claimed new 5G towers were spreading the virus through microwaves. Another popular story held that Microsoft founder Bill Gates plans to use COVID-19 vaccines to implant microchips in all 7 billion people on the planet.
Then there are the political theories — that doctors, journalists and federal officials are conspiring to lie about the threat of the virus to hurt Trump politically.
Social media has amplified the claims and helped believers find each other. The flood of misinformation has posed a challenge for Facebook, Twitter and other platforms, which have found themselves accused of censorship for taking down virus misinformation.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned about Immanuel's video during an often-contentious congressional hearing Wednesday.
""We did take it down because it violates our policies,"" Zuckerberg said.
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat leading the hearing, responded by noting that 20 million people saw the video before Facebook acted.
""Doesn't that suggest that your platform is so big, that even with the right policies in place, you can't contain deadly content?"" Cicilline asked Zuckerberg.
It wasn't the first video containing misinformation about the virus, and experts say it's not likely to be the last.
A professionally made 26-minute video that alleges the government's top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, manufactured the virus and shipped it to China was watched more than 8 million times before the platforms took action. The video, titled ""Plandemic,"" also warned that masks could make you sick — the false claim Facebook cited when it removed the video down from its site.
Judy Mikovits, the discredited doctor behind ""Plandemic,"" had been set to appear on the show ""America This Week"" on the Sinclair Broadcast Group. But the company, which operates TV stations in 81 U.S. markets, canned the segment, saying it was ""not appropriate"" to air.
This week, U.S. government officials speaking on condition of anonymity cited what they said was a clear link between Russian intelligence and websites with stories designed to spread disinformation on the coronavirus in the West. Russian officials rejected the accusations.
Of all the bizarre and myriad claims about the virus, those regarding masks are proving to be among the most stubborn.
New York City resident Carlos Lopez said he wears a mask when required to do so but doesn't believe it is necessary.
""They're politicizing it as a tool,"" he said. ""I think it's more to try to get Trump to lose. It's more a scare tactic.""
He is in the minority. A recent AP/NORC poll said 3 in 4 Americans — Democrats and Republicans alike — support a national mask mandate.
Still, mask skeptics are a vocal minority and have come together to create social media pages where many false claims about mask safety are shared. Facebook has removed some of the pages — such as the group Unmasking America!, which had nearly 10,000 members — but others remain.
Early in the pandemic, medical authorities themselves were the source of much confusion regarding masks. In February, officials like the U.S. surgeon general urged Americans not to stockpile masks because they were needed by medical personnel and might not be effective in everyday situations.
Public health officials changed their tune when it became apparent that the virus could spread among people showing no symptoms.
Yet Trump remained reluctant to use a mask, mocked his rival Joe Biden for wearing one and suggested people might be covering their faces just to hurt him politically. He did an abrupt about-face this month, claiming that he had always supported masks — then later retweeted Immanuel's video against masks.
The mixed signals hurt, Fauci acknowledged in an interview with NPR this month.
""The message early on became confusing,"" he said.
Many of the claims around masks allege harmful effects, such as blocked oxygen flow or even a greater chance of infection. The claims have been widely debunked by doctors.
Dr. Maitiu O Tuathail of Ireland grew so concerned about mask misinformation he posted an online video of himself comfortably wearing a mask while measuring his oxygen levels. The video has been viewed more than 20 million times.
""While face masks don't lower your oxygen levels. COVID definitely does,"" he warned.
Yet trusted medical authorities are often being dismissed by those who say requiring people to wear masks is a step toward authoritarianism.
""Unless you make a stand, you will be wearing a mask for the rest of your life,"" tweeted Simon Dolan, a British businessman who has sued the government over its COVID-19 restrictions.
Trump's reluctant, ambivalent and late embrace of masks hasn't convinced some of his strongest supporters, who have concocted ever more elaborate theories to explain his change of heart. Some say he was actually speaking in code and doesn't really support masks.
O Tuathail witnessed just how unshakable COVID-19 misinformation can be when, after broadcasting his video, he received emails from people who said he cheated or didn't wear the mask long enough to feel the negative effects.
That's not surprising, according to University of Central Florida psychology professor Chrysalis Wright, who studies misinformation. She said conspiracy theory believers often engage in mental gymnastics to make their beliefs conform with reality.
""People only want to hear what they already think they know,"" she said."
"July 29, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-dismisses-virus-aid-for-cities-lashes-out-at-gop/571943842/,StarTribune,"As virus aid talks stalemate, Trump scorns help for cities","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday dismissed Democratic demands for aid to cash-strapped cities in a new coronavirus relief package and lashed out at Republican allies as talks stalemated over assistance for millions of Americans. Another lawmaker tested positive for the virus.
Republicans, beset by delays and infighting, signaled a willingness to swiftly approve a modest package to revamp a $600 weekly unemployment benefit that's running out. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., roundly rejected that approach as meager, all but forcing Republicans back to the negotiating table. Without action, the aid expires Friday.
""We're nowhere close to the deal,"" said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. He said they're ""miles apart.""
Stark differences remain between the $3 trillion proposal from Democrats and $1 trillion counter from Republicans, a standoff that is testing Trump and Congress ahead of the November election and putting aid for communities nationwide at risk.
Pelosi said the best way to reopen schools and the economy is to defeat the virus, and that can't be done with the ""skinny"" bill Republicans are rushing to cobble together. ""They still don't get it,"" Pelosi said.
The virus toll continued to mount in the U.S., with 4.4 million confirmed cases and deaths passing 150,000. Outspoken Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, who often objects to mask-wearing, became the latest lawmaker at the Capitol to test positive for the virus.
Money for states and cites is a crucial dividing line as local governments plead for help to shore up budgets and prevent deeper layoffs as they incur COVID-19 costs and lost tax revenue in shutdown economies.
Trump complained about sending ""big bailout money"" to the nation's cities, whose mayors he often criticizes.
""It's a shame to reward badly run radical left Democrats with all of this money they're looking for,"" he said at the White House.
Democrats proposed nearly $1 trillion for the local governments, but Trump and Republicans are resisting sending the states and cities more cash.
Instead, the GOP offers states flexibility to use $150 billion previously allotted for the virus on other needs. At one point this year, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said states could just declare bankruptcy.
Governors and mayors who have been urging Congress to help warned that inaction would hit hard.
""If Congress fails to dedicate financial assistance to state and local governments, it will force deep cuts to the very programs workers and families need to get back on their feet,"" said Tara Lee, spokeswoman for Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat.
Most states have built up reserves since the Great Recession, but the pandemic stopped swaths of the economy in March.
Municipal cutbacks and layoffs began. By June, about 1.5 million fewer people were working for governments in the U.S. compared with February, according federal data. More than half the government layoffs have been in education, a sector facing daunting costs as schools prepare to reopen to students.
Last month, Moody's Analytics said states were facing a cumulative budget gap of $312 billion over the next two years and local governments would need nearly $200 billion more. Some estimates have calculated the budget gaps as even bigger.
""These are not fancy actions,"" said Democrat Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, Ohio, and vice president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. ""These are actions around emergency medical providers, fire, police, services the president claims he values.""
It's clear that Democrats are trying to push an advantage in the negotiations because Republicans are so deeply divided over the prospect of big government spending.
Trump dismissed the GOP bill as ""semi-irrelevant"" as his team launched talks with Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
McConnell defended his approach as ""serious,"" but he was unable to bring his majority on board. Many Republicans came around to the White House's pitch for a smaller package by Friday.
That's when the $600 unemployment benefit boost as well as a federal eviction moratorium on millions of rental units expire, potentially sending households into devastating turmoil.
Speaking at the White House, Trump signaled his interest in reaching a deal and averting an eviction crisis.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading the negotiations, said ""the president is very focused"" on unemployment aid and assistance for renters.
But the president said his GOP allies should ""go back to school and learn"" after they balked at $1.7 billion for FBI headquarters in the bill. Trump wants the FBI's central building to remain in Washington, across the street from his Trump International Hotel. McConnell opposed the request as unrelated to virus relief.
But Pelosi showed no interest in going small bore on aid. Asked what she thinks of that approach, Pelosi said: ""Nothing. Not even 'not much.' Nothing.""
Republicans propose cutting the $600 weekly unemployment benefit bump to $200 a week as an incentive to push people back to work. On the eviction freeze put in place in March, Democrats proposed extending it, but Republicans did not include it in their bill and Trump hasn't specified what he's wants to do.
""There's no consensus on anything,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
At the Capitol, Pelosi used a zoo metaphor to explain to Mnuchin and Meadows the divide. You see a giraffe, you see a flamingo, Pelosi told the White House team late Tuesday during private talks. These two bills, she said, ""aren't mateable.""
The conversations were relayed by two people who were not authorized to publicly discuss the private session and spoke on condition of anonymity."
"July 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/a-virus-cluster-in-france-splits-generations-raises-fears/571952652/,StarTribune,"A virus cluster in France splits generations, raises fears","PARIS — As the sun went down, their partying got into full flow, with an unwanted guest: the coronavirus.
An outbreak among 18- to 25-year-olds at a seaside resort on the Brittany coast is crystallizing fears that the virus is flaring again in France, on the back of vacationers throwing COVID-19 caution to the summer winds.
With 72 infections by Wednesday — mostly among that age group — uncovered in a week of furious contact tracing, the cluster on the Quiberon peninsula was thought to have originated with a supermarket summer worker who partied with others at a nightspot.
It is becoming a textbook case of the virus pitting generations against each other.
The government's top regional official, a former soldier and intelligence officer in his 50s, hasn't minced his words in decrying the ""irresponsibility of young people who are vacationing or living here, gathering in large numbers for festivities at night, ignoring the danger.""
The official, Patrice Faure, prefect of Brittany's Morbihan region, personally served a two-month closure order on a Quiberon discotheque, the Hacienda Cafe. Among the nightspots where now-infected people congregated, it skirted a national coronavirus ban on nightclubbing by converting itself into a late-night watering hole, blocking off its dance floor with tables and bar stools.
The owners told the regional newspaper Ouest-France that they urged patrons to wear masks but also noted: ""They're young, on holiday or doing summer jobs, and they'd been drinking. They didn't listen.""
Although authorities insist the outbreak is under control, the peninsula that used to be a sardine-fishing hub has become a flashpoint for fears that France is going backward in the epidemic that has infected more than 185,000 and killed at least 30,200 in the country. Infection rates are creeping up and authorities warn that people are disregarding pleas to use common sense as millions revel in the country's July-August break.
In Paris, nurse Damien Vaillant-Foulquier worries that a second wave of infections will derail the plans that he and his wife, also a nurse, have made to join the exodus in mid-August. His hospital, which managed to empty its ICU wards after weathering the initial wave, already is seeing new COVID-19 patients and asking trainee nurses if they'll be around later in the summer to work, he said.
""At the hospital, we sense the arrival of the second wave,"" he said. ""I'm depressed because it's my impression that people don't see the danger and have forgotten why we were locked-down at home.""
Cycling recently through the French capital, ""I saw that the bars on the big boulevards had been turned into nightspots, full inside and outside, everyone was dancing, no masks, nothing, absolutely no respect for social distancing,"" Vaillant-Foulquier said.
""The young are accused a lot of not being responsible, but it's not just the young,"" he said.
Romain Arnal, a 20-year-old student, is among those who have been letting their hair — and their guard — down in Quiberon. He vacations there every year, hooking up with a holiday sweetheart whom he first met in the resort three summers ago.
""When we're in smaller groups, with friends, we don't really pay attention, even if it's people we've just met. We invite each other over, with no masks on, obviously,"" he said.
Worried by the infection spike, Arnal says he has gone to a makeshift testing station set up in Quiberon to contain the outbreak, but has been foiled by the long lines. Authorities have urged that everyone get tested, especially the Hacienda's partygoers. That's a mammoth task on the peninsula, where the population swells from 5,000 to 60,000 in the summer.
Quiberon has made mask-wearing mandatory on some of its busiest streets, joining other vacation towns in going further than the national requirement for masks in all indoor public spaces. And it slapped nighttime curfews on beaches and public parks, concerned that young people without symptoms could spread the coronavirus to the less-healthy.
""I hope, or at least I imagine, that they have no desire to spread the virus to their parents, their grandparents, their neighbors, uncles and aunts,"" said Faure, the prefect. ""It's extremely inopportune to party today like in 2019.""
Fishing guide Alexandre Lesage, 39, says he feels for the generation he sees trying to enjoy itself at the same spots and beaches where he spent his youth, free of the uncertain future now facing young people confronting a job market in coronavirus turmoil.
""They're being treated like pest-carriers, as if they're totally irresponsible, when in fact they are just young at heart,"" he said. ""I would not like to be in their shoes."""

Lower interest rates and investor optimism about a possible coronavirus vaccine have helped global markets recover most of this year's losses. But analysts say the recovery might be too early to be supported by uncertain economic activity as infection numbers rise in the United States, Brazil and other countries.
On Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that rising U.S. cases, which have led some state governments to reimpose anti-disease measures, threaten the modest recovery from the pandemic.
The Fed said it would keep buying $120 billion of Treasury and mortgage bonds every month to encourage borrowing and spending, but Powell said Congress needs to take action. Legislators have yet to agree on aid after $600 in weekly unemployment benefits for millions of Americans run out this week.

"July 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/can-you-get-the-coronavirus-twice/571928532/,StarTribune,Can you get the coronavirus twice?,"Can you get the coronavirus twice?
Scientists don’t know for sure yet, but they believe it’s unlikely.
Health experts think people who had COVID-19 will have some immunity against a repeat infection. But they don’t know how much protection or how long it would last.
There have been reports of people testing positive for the virus weeks after they were believed to have recovered, leading some to think they may have been reinfected. More likely, experts say people were suffering from the same illness or the tests detected remnants of the original infection. There’s also the chance tests could have been false positives.
Scientists say there has been no documented instance of a patient spreading the virus to others after retesting positive.
With similar viruses, studies have shown that people could fall sick again three months to a year after their first infections. It’s still too early to know whether that’s also possible with the coronavirus.
“It’s very much emerging science,” said Dr. Philip Landrigan, director of the global public health program at Boston College.
A small U.S. study published last week also found the antibodies that fight the coronavirus may only last a few months in people with mild illness, suggesting people could become susceptible again. But antibodies aren’t the only defense against a virus, and the other parts of the immune system could also help provide protection.
Settling the question of whether reinfection is possible is important. If it can occur, that could undermine the idea of “immunity passports” for returning back to workplaces. And it would not bode well for hopes of getting a long-lasting vaccine."
"July 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/trump-vs-biden-where-they-stand-on-health-economy-more/571952122/,StarTribune,"Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.
Trump, like many fellow Republicans, holds out tax reductions and regulatory cuts as economic cure-alls and frames himself as a conservative champion in seemingly endless culture wars. But the president, still trying to fashion himself as an outsider, offers little detail about how he'd pull the levers of government in a second term.
Biden, for his part, sounds every bit the Democratic standard-bearer as he frames the federal government as the collective force to combat the coronavirus, rebuild the economy and address centuries of institutional racism and systemic inequalities. A veteran of national politics, Biden also loves framing his deal-making past as proof he can do it again from the Oval Office.
It leaves Americans with an unambiguous choice. A look at where the rivals stand on key issues:
ECONOMY, TAXES
Decades-low unemployment and a soaring stock market were Trump's calling cards before the pandemic. While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stood at 11.1% in June, higher than the nadir of the Great Recession. There were still about 14.7 million fewer jobs last month than there were prior to the pandemic in February.
Trump has predicted that the U.S. economy will rebound in the third and fourth quarters of this year and is set to take off like a ""rocket ship"" in the new year, a prediction that bakes in the assumption that a coronavirus vaccine or effective therapeutics have hit the market that allow life to get back to normal. He's still advocating for a payroll tax cut, though such a measure faces stiff bipartisan opposition. Winning a second term — and a mandate from voters — might be his best hope at getting it through.
Biden pitches sweeping federal action as necessary to avoid an extended recession or depression and to address long-standing wealth inequality that disproportionately affects nonwhite Americans. His biggest-ticket plans: a $2 trillion, four-year push intended to eliminate carbon pollution in the U.S. energy grid by 2035 and a new government health insurance plan open to all working-age Americans (with generous subsidies). He proposes new spending on education, infrastructure and small businesses, along with raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Biden would cover some but not all of the new costs by rolling back much of the 2017 GOP tax overhaul. He wants a corporate income tax rate of 28% (lower than before but higher than now) and broad income and payroll tax hikes for individuals with more than $400,000 of annual taxable income. All that would generate an estimated $4 trillion or more over 10 years. Biden frames immigration as an economic matter, as well. He wants to expand legal immigration slots and offer a citizenship path for about 11 million residents who are in the country illegally but who, Biden notes, are already economic contributors as workers and consumers.
EDUCATION
Trump has used his push for schools to fully reopen this fall amid the pandemic as an opportunity to spotlight his support for charter schools and school choice.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime proponent of charter schools and school voucher programs, has suggested that families be allowed to take federal money allotted to school districts that don't open and spend it in private schools that do open. For most of Trump's first term, his administration has sought major increases to federal charter school grant aid. But Congress has responded with relatively small increases.
With higher education, Trump has repeatedly complained that campuses are beset by ""radical left indoctrination."" He recently threatened to defund universities, saying that he was having the Treasury Department reexamine tax-exempt status and federal funding of unspecified schools.
Biden wants the federal government to partner with states to make public higher education tuition-free for any student in a household earning up to $125,000 annually. The assistance would extend to everyone attending two-year schools, regardless of income. He also proposes sharply increasing aid for historically Black colleges. His overall education plans carry a 10-year price tag of about $850 billion.
He calls for universal access to prekindergarten programs for 3- and 4-year-olds; tripling Title I spending for schools with higher concentrations of students from low-income households; more support for non-classroom positions like on-campus social workers; federal infrastructure spending for public school buildings; and covering schools' costs to comply with federal disability laws. Biden also opposes taxpayer money being routed to for-profit charter school businesses, and he's pledged that his secretary of education will have classroom teaching experience.
HEALTH CARE
As a candidate for the White House, Trump promised that he would ""immediately"" replace President Barack Obama's health care law with a plan of his own that would provide ""insurance for everybody."" In the last leg of his first term, Americans are still waiting for Trump to make his big reveal. Trump officials say the administration has made strides by championing transparency on hospital prices, pursuing a range of actions to curb prescription drug costs and expanding lower-cost health insurance alternatives for small businesses and individuals. But those incremental steps are far short from the sweeping changes Trump had promised.
Biden wants a ""Medicare-like public option"" to compete alongside private insurance markets for working-age Americans, while increasing premium subsidies that many working-class and middle-class workers use already under the Affordable Care Act. Biden estimates that would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. That positions Biden between Trump, who wants to scrap the 2010 law, and progressives who want a single-payer system to replace private insurance altogether. Biden sees his approach as the next step toward universal coverage and one he could get through Congress.
CORONAVIRUS
After months of insisting that the worst days of the pandemic have passed, Trump recently acknowledged that the pandemic may ""get worse before it gets better"" as many states — including several critical to his path to 270 Electoral College votes — have seen a surge in the virus.
Trump is again holding regular briefings to directly get his message out on the virus and other matters. Trump believes that a key to economic recovery from the virus is fully reopening schools -— though Americans are wary. Only about 1 in 10 Americans think day care centers, preschools or K-12 schools should open this fall without restrictions, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.
Trump also says he's ""pretty damn certain"" that vaccines and therapeutics for the virus are coming in the not-so-distant future — a game changer as Americans and the world seek a glide path to normalcy. Congress approved about $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in March and April, and Democrats, Republicans and the White House are negotiating another significant round of funding. The package, however, won't include a payroll tax cut — something that Trump badly wanted but that Senate Democrats and even some Senate Republicans balked at including.
Biden draws some of his sharpest contrasts with Trump on the pandemic, arguing that the presidency and federal government exist for such crises. Trump, by contrast, has largely shifted responsibility to governors. Biden endorses generous federal spending to help businesses and individuals, along with state and local governments, deal with the financial cliffs of the pandemic slowdown. He's promised aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, the wartime law a president can use to direct certain private-sector activity. Additionally, Biden promises to elevate the government's scientists and physicians to communicate a consistent message to the public, and he would have the U.S. rejoin the World Health Organization. He's also willing to use executive power for a national mask mandate, even if its enforcement is questionable.
TRADE
Trump views the signing of two major trade deals — an updated pact with Mexico and Canada and Phase 1 of a China agreement — as signature achievements of his presidency. U.S. and China signed Phase 1 in January, less than two months before the coronavirus pandemic put an enormous strain on U.S.-Sino relations. Trump says Phase 1 led to China buying roughly $200 billion over two years in U.S. agricultural products, energy and other American products. In return, the U.S. canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made smartphones, toys and laptop computers. The U.S. also cut in half, to 7.5%, the tariff rate levied on $120 billion in other China imports.
Phase 2 of the deal is expected to focus on some tougher issues between the countries, including Trump's wish to get China to stop subsidizing its state-owned enterprises. But for Trump, who has come to frequently refer to the coronavirus as the ""China virus,"" it remains to be seen whether he will be able to effectively reengage Beijing on trade. Trump recently said he's ""not interested"" in presently talking to China.
Biden has joined a growing bipartisan embrace of ""fair trade"" abroad — a twist on decades of ""free trade"" talk as Republican and Democratic administrations alike expanded international trade. Biden wants to juice U.S. manufacturing by directing $400 billion of federal government purchases to domestic firms (part of that for buying pandemic supplies) over a four-year term. He wants $300 billion in new support for U.S. technology firms' research and development. Biden says the new domestic spending must come before he enters into any new international trade deals. He pledges tough negotiations with China, the world's other economic superpower, on trade and intellectual property matters. China, like the U.S., is not yet a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade agreement that Biden advocated for when he was vice president.
FOREIGN POLICY
During his first term, Trump built his foreign policy around the mantra of ""America First."" Besides the trade deals, he counts as major achievements building more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, cajoling more NATO members to fulfill their pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defense spending and reducing the U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan and other hot spots. He also announced his intended withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.
Trump can officially withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement — it sets the goal of holding global warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit — as an example of an agreement that ""disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries."" The deal, which was signed by Obama, stipulates that no nation can leave until four years after they signed on. For the U.S., that's Nov. 4 — one day after the U.S. election.
The president has also made clear his desire to leave Afghanistan sooner than the timeline laid out in the Feb. 29 peace agreement with the Taliban, which set the path for U.S. troops to leave the country in 12 to 14 months if the insurgent group met certain conditions. There are currently about 8,600 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Trump also counts his engagement with North Korea's Kim Jong Un as a monumental achievement. The president has not been able to prod Kim to give up the nation's nuclear program, but he has met the autocrat twice for face-to-face talks.
Biden says he'd begin ""the day after the election"" rebuilding relationships with allies ruffled by Trump's approach. Biden's top priority is reestablishing the foundations of NATO, the post-World War II alliance of Western powers that Biden said is necessary to counter Russia's aggressive, expansionist aims in eastern Europe and Asia. Biden said he'd immediately confront Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country's interference in U.S. elections. Biden pledges to ""end forever wars"" but clarifies that U.S. special forces — as opposed to large-scale ground missions — remain a vital part of world stability. Biden frames immigration and combating the climate crisis as national security matters. He calls for rebuilding a decimated U.S. diplomatic corps, rejoining the Paris climate accord and pushing China and other large economies to reduce carbon pollution. On immigration, Biden calls for expanding legal immigration opportunities while reversing Trump's cuts to foreign aid programs intended to promote world stability and reduce migration."
"July 30, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/evers-orders-masks-statewide-as-coronavirus-cases-spike/571958472/,StarTribune,Wisconsin governor orders masks statewide amid virus surge,"MADISON, Wis. — Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers on Thursday issued a statewide mask mandate amid a spike in coronavirus cases, setting up a conflict with Republican legislative leaders and some conservatives who oppose such a requirement and successfully sued to kill the governor's ""safer at home"" order.
Evers, a Democrat, declared a new public health emergency and ordered the wearing of masks for anyone age 5 and up starting on Saturday for all enclosed spaces except a person's home. The new order also applies to outdoor bars and restaurants, except when people are eating or drinking.
Anyone who violates the order would be subject to a $200 fine. It is scheduled to run until Sept. 28.
""This virus doesn't care about any town, city, or county boundary, and we need a statewide approach to get Wisconsin back on track,"" Evers said in a statement, citing the recent rise in cases across the state.
The conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court in May tossed out an order from Evers' health secretary closing most nonessential businesses in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.
Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said he opposes a statewide mandate, but he indicated that he wouldn't sue to stop it like he did the ""safer at home"" order.
""There are certainly constitutional questions here,"" Vos said. ""I would expect legal challenges from citizen groups.""
Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, a Republican from Juneau, said Evers may have opened himself to legal challenges. Fitzgerald also said he is gauging the interest of his caucus in reconvening the Legislature and voting down the order.
""Masks are fine, but we don't need statewide mandates telling us what to do. Many people are wearing masks already,"" Fitzgerald said in a statement.
Rick Esenberg, president of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, which has sued Evers several times, said the governor ""lacks the legal authority"" to issue the order. Esenberg stopped short of promising a lawsuit, saying he was reviewing it.
Republican state Sen. Steve Nass, one of the Legislature's most conservative members, called for lawmakers to meet in an emergency session to kill the order, which he called ""illegal and unnecessary."" Evers said he would welcome the Legislature meeting to address the pandemic, which it hasn't done since mid-April. But he said it was a ""sad commentary"" that Nass wanted to reconvene just to kill the mask order.
""Obviously he doesn't believe that masks matter,"" Evers said. ""That's fine, he can be one of those people that flouts the order. But to come in and have the Republicans say essentially we don't believe in science, it's pretty risky business. It's risky political business and risky health business.""
Vos did not say whether the Legislature would reconvene to kill the order.
Evers has repeatedly cited the earlier Supreme Court ruling as a reason for his reluctance to join 32 other states that have mask mandates. However, the May ruling determined that the state health secretary overstepped her authority with the ""safer at home"" order; the court did not address the governor's power to issue public health emergencies.
The state's high court was controlled 5-2 by conservatives when it struck down the earlier order on a split 4-3 decision. But on Saturday, when the mask order takes effect, Justice-elect Jill Karofsky will join the court, narrowing the conservative majority to 4-3 and increasing the odds of the order surviving a legal challenge.
Evers said the rise in COVID-19 cases, not Karofsky's joining the court, and the fact that not enough people wore masks voluntarily motivated him to act now. Evers had been under pressure from local governments, and even some Democrats, to issue a statewide order. Democratic state Sen. Chris Larson, of Milwaukee, started a petition for a statewide mandate.
""The bottom line is we need to keep people safe and this is one way to do it,"" he said. ""We hope the Supreme Court agrees with us. You never know, it may never end up in the Supreme Court.""
Numerous cities and counties across Wisconsin have already instituted mask mandates, including Milwaukee and Dane counties, Green Bay, Racine, Superior and Whitewater. Evers' order doesn't preempt local governments from enacting even stricter ordinances.
Wisconsin has had more than 52,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 919 deaths from the disease since the pandemic started. That death count is the 28th-highest in the country and the 35th highest per capita, at nearly 16 deaths per 100,000 people. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has gone up by 90, an increase of more than 11%.
The virus, although still heavily concentrated in urban areas, is spreading to more rural counties that had largely avoided the disease."
"July 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/doctors-try-pressurized-oxygen-chambers-in-covid-fight/571967972/,StarTribune,Doctors try pressurized oxygen chambers in COVID fight,"As a New York University medical researcher who works once a week in an emergency room, Dr. David Lee had the luxury of time to think like a scientist while also treating coronavirus patients whose lungs kept giving out. In every case, he saw the same thing: Their blood was starved of oxygen.
One day an idea hit him: Could hyperbaric oxygen therapy, best known for treating divers with the bends, help stave off the need for ventilators and perhaps reduce deaths?
Physiologically it made sense to him, but he soon learned it was also complicated. The therapy, which involves delivering 100% oxygen straight to patients inside a pressurized chamber, is often met with skepticism by the wider medical community because fringe supporters have long touted it as a virtual cure-all without scientific evidence.
So much so that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote a consumer update a few years ago, explaining that the therapy is only approved for 13 types of treatment, ranging from burns to deep wounds and carbon monoxide poisoning. The agency warned patients not to be misled by claims on the Internet that it works for conditions such as cancer or autism.
Still, with medical teams worldwide having little success at saving lives despite throwing everything they had at COVID patients — testing old drugs, trying new ones — Lee believed doctors should be more open to exploring different types of treatments. He brought his theory to Dr. Scott Gorenstein, a colleague at NYU Winthrop Hospital on Long Island with a decade of experience in the field.
Though the treatment is non-invasive, with a long history of safety, both men knew they faced major obstacles. Chief among them: finding funding, and overcoming skepticism about the treatment fueled by hyperbaric spas as well as videos of celebrities like Justin Bieber and LeBron James using portable chambers.
""If we were to promote hyperbaric without a rigorous scientific trial, because of the fringe community that's already doing that, the likelihood that it would be accepted by mainstream medical communities is close to zero,"" said Gorenstein.
Within two weeks, the doctors had approval from an NYU institutional review board for a small, case-control trial that would allow them to compare COVID-19 patients treated with hyperbarics to a control group matched with similar characteristics, such as age, sex, health conditions and oxygen requirements, that did not get it.
Twenty hyperbaric patients, predominantly men age 30 to 79, received up to five 90-minute treatments during the month-long study. Gorenstein said almost all experienced relief of symptoms once sealed inside the clear tube, similar in shape to the old iron lungs once used to treat polio. Some went from having unresponsive ""deer-in-the-headlights"" dazes to being alert and engaged, while others reported being able to sleep afterward for the first time in days. Eighteen of those patients recovered and were discharged within days or weeks.
Two people died, and the death of one of them halted the study and prompted a hospital safety assessment. It concluded hyperbaric treatment was not the cause, Lee said. The FDA also was asked to review the case, but he said there has not yet been a response.
The control group saw a significantly higher rate of intubations, deaths, and long-term hospitalizations. However, both Gorenstein and Lee stressed that the trial, which will soon be published, was too small to draw any solid conclusions.
""What we've been able to do, I think, is demonstrate that this therapy deserves to be studied in a large way,"" Gorenstein said, adding the next step would be to secure funding for a larger, randomized control trial at multiple centers.
Scientists remain baffled by the complex nature of COVID-19, its range of victims, its acute and long-haul symptoms, and even the accuracy of tests used to confirm infections. With more than 660,000 people succumbing globally — nearly a quarter of them in the U.S. — there's been little time for robust scientific studies in the race to find effective treatments.
Initial fanfare over the old antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the anti-viral remdesivir quickly died down after it became clear neither was a silver bullet. There's also been excitement over steroids, experimental convalescent plasma, and even antibodies from a Belgian llama named Winter.
What many of those treatments do have is financial backing from pharmaceutical companies, giving them an advantage over hyperbaric and other non-drug therapies. Oxygen, however, is not something that can be patented, and doctors say there are no big profits to be made from using the pressurized pods.
One of the biggest risks in hyperbarics is transporting patients to and from the chamber, given how sick they are and their absolute dependence on supplemental oxygen. There are also questions about how the treatment might affect blood-clotting disorders or if too much oxygen could lead to toxicity and, possibly, seizures.
""My feeling about any kind of intervention, it's really important that that be done through clinical trials. If such data existed, then perfect, it's worth a try,"" said Mitchell Levy, medical director of the intensive care unit at Rhode Island Hospital and a professor of medicine at Brown University.
""But we want to be really careful that we're not just acting out of desperation, giving things that may be harmful ... or spending a lot of money on ineffective therapies. And that's the challenge of entering this uncharted territory,"" Levy said
The treatment was first given to a handful of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, with promising results. A study in Sweden plans to recruit 200 participants. Israel, France and Italy are among others trying it. It's also being tested out at several U.S. hospitals, including at the Opelousas General Health System in Louisiana.
Kathy Fuselier, 62, who works in the pharmacy there, said she felt it helped her. ""I didn't have to be put on the vent,"" she said. ""Came close, but didn't need the vent.""
With a virus as mysterious and cunning as COVID, Lee said it's essential to raise questions. But he added it's just as important to keep an open mind.
""There's a lot of people trying to find solutions,"" he said, adding hyperbarics could just be one piece of a larger puzzle. ""This is not going to be an end-all, be-all."""

PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota faces a potential $4.7 billion deficit in its next two-year budget due to continued economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new planning estimate announced Friday by the Minnesota Management and Budget office.
Management and Budget Commissioner Myron Frans said the pandemic has made economic conditions ""extremely volatile.""
A February economic forecast showed the state had a projected $1.5 billion budget surplus for the rest of this budget year, ending July 2021. But after the pandemic hit, a May update showed the state faces a $2.4 billion deficit this budget cycle. The Star Tribune reported that updated numbers for 2022 and 2023 show a continued slide.
Gov. Tim Walz in a statement that states nationwide are facing large budget gaps due to the pandemic and: ""We have challenges ahead, but we will continue to make smart fiscal decisions and request aid from the federal government to help our state manage this difficult time.""
Minnesota received more than $2 billion in federal coronavirus relief, but that money can't be used for revenue collection gaps.
Minnesota has a budget reserve that has grown to nearly $2.4 billion over the years, with $350 million in a cash flow account. But as the deficit grows, lawmakers face potential budget cuts or tax increases to fill the gap."

The United States will pay up to $2.1 billion “for development including clinical trials, manufacturing, scale-up and delivery"" of the vaccine, the two companies based in Europe said in a statement. Sanofi will get the bulk of the funds.
The U.S. government has a further option for the supply of an additional 500 million doses longer term as part of its Operation Warp Speed program.
“The portfolio of vaccines being assembled for Operation Warp Speed increases the odds that we will have at least one safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. “Today’s investment supports the Sanofi and GSK adjuvanted product all the way through clinical trials and manufacturing, with the potential to bring hundreds of millions of safe and effective doses to the American people.”
Earlier this week the British government signed a deal for 60 million doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine that could start to be rolled out in the first half of next year.
The vaccine being developed by Britain's GSK and France’s Sanofi’s is based on existing DNA-based technology that is used to produce Sanofi’s seasonal flu vaccine. It is one of several vaccines in development."
"July 31, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/checks-aside-d-c-finds-little-to-agree-on-for-new-stimulus-plan/571974832/,StarTribune,"Stimulus checks aside, little agreement in Congress over new stimulus plan","WASHINGTON – As time expires on elements of the first coronavirus relief package, the triple threat of mass evictions, lost unemployment benefits and cratering gross domestic product has yet to bring the U.S. Senate and House and the White House together on a new economic stimulus plan.
The House passed a $3.4 trillion relief plan, the HEROES Act, in May. This week, the Senate offered a $1.1 trillion plan, the HEALS Act. With an August recess set to begin Aug. 8, both chambers of Congress are under pressure to reach an agreement over starkly different approaches to rescue the U.S. economy from coronavirus ruin.
Republicans want to cut $600 weekly federal supplements to unemployment payments to $200 per week because they say the higher amount discourages people from trying to find jobs.
Democrats want money for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing and other state and local aid that the White House and Republicans balk at.
Republicans want to shield businesses from COVID-related lawsuits. Democrats want workers and consumers protected.
The only thing that looks very likely is that Americans will get a second stimulus check of at least $1,200 if they make less than $75,000. They may also get some additional money depending on how many dependents they have. Republicans want to stick with $500 per dependent. Democrats want to raise dependent supplements to $1,200 per dependent and expand the number of dependents who are eligible.
Minnesota’s federal delegation offers a representative example of the national partisan fight.
“The provisions providing an extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits needs to be revised so people are incentivized to go back to work,” Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn said.
Republican Rep. Pete Stauber said the additional $600 per week the first stimulus package offered left some recipients getting more in unemployment pay than they made at the jobs they lost.
Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson, who voted for the House relief bill, broke ranks with his party on the issue. “If the unemployment benefits are extended for those who are unable to get back to work, it shouldn’t be for more than people were making while working.”
Other Democrats in the Minnesota delegation want the $600 weekly supplement to continue for as long as the president’s national-emergency declaration lasts. The Democrats also seek other forms of financial support.
“We need to act with a sense of urgency to immediately renew the unemployment benefits that will lapse this week, approve another round of stimulus payments to families, and pass much-needed help for schools, state and local government, ” Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said.
Funding for local and state government is a huge sticking point between the plans. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, state and local aid totals roughly $1.1 trillion in the Democratic stimulus bill. The Republican plan includes only $105 billion.
Republican Rep. Tom Emmer said “American families still need a hand up through these difficult times. However, we need to make sure we are not spending ourselves into another crisis down the line.” He cautioned that “endless spending from the government will not solve this crisis.”
Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar countered that all Americans must have access to COVID-19 testing. Klobuchar supports the House relief bill, saying it addresses “the continued problems with coronavirus testing,” supports “state and local governments in their response to the pandemic” and delivers “funding to ensure that people can safely vote” in the November presidential election. “The Senate,” Klobuchar said, “needs to pass the HEROES Act to help all Americans.
Democratic Rep. Angie Craig led a group of House members who fought to expand the number of dependents eligible for stimulus supplements. Craig pushed to raise the maximum age of dependents from 16 to 19 and included full time students up to age 24 and permanently disabled dependents in the mix.
A Republican move to provide businesses immunity from lawsuits arising from their treatment of employees and customers during the pandemic offers another point of contention. Stauber and Hagedorn both cited the need to protect businesses from what Hagedorn called “frivolous lawsuits.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called the immunity issue nonnegotiable with Democrats who say the number of COVID-related lawsuits filed so far is minimal and that workers and shoppers deserve protection.
The Washington Post reported Friday that President Donald Trump and his staff might be willing to sacrifice business immunity in order to extend unemployment insurance.
Pandemic stimulus legislation has become a catchall for both parties. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who hopes to include a measure providing free school meals for all students for the duration of the pandemic, criticized Republicans for offering a pandemic relief package that “includes billions of dollars for projects unrelated to the worst crisis our country has ever endured.”
An example is funding for a new FBI building that the Republican majority in the Senate offered in its COVID-19 response package.
As leaders of the House, Senate and Trump negotiated, several members of the Minnesota delegation criticized the 11th-hour nature of the talks.
“In mid-May, Democrats passed the HEROES Act,” said Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum. “We’ve known for the past two and a half months that a crisis awaits millions of American families if these benefits are not extended. If Republicans care at all about avoiding total disaster and devastation, they will work with us to save lives and livelihoods.”"

The exchange's website showed it closed at 2,011,492 points, up some 50,000 points from Saturday. Government authorities also offered additional shares of state-owned companies onto the market Sunday.
The Tehran Stock Exchange has seen sharp increases this year, even as Iran struggled with one of the first serious coronavirus outbreaks outside China.
Encouraged by a government eager to privatize state-owned firms, average people now have access to the market and can trade shares, earning returns they'd never see in a savings account or a certificate of deposit.
But these rapid gains increasingly have analysts and experts worried about a growing stock market bubble, one that could be particularly dire and wipe away the earnings of the average people flooding into the market.
Even Iranian President Hassan Rouhani — beleaguered since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from his 2015 nuclear deal with world powers — has pointed to the market as a rare bright spot for the country. Iran's rial currency has fallen to some 230,000 to 1 against the U.S. dollar, as opposed to the 35,000 to $1 in 2015.
Founded in 1967, the Tehran Stock Exchange lists some 1,000 companies, including major firms like car manufacturer Iran Khodro. The bourse now has a market cap of more than $200 billion."
"August 2, 2020",https://www.startribune.com/scientists-study-coronavirus-outbreaks-among-minks-in-europe/571984522/,StarTribune,Scientists study coronavirus outbreaks among minks in Europe,"MADRID — Coronavirus outbreaks at mink farms in Spain and the Netherlands have scientists digging into how the animals got infected and if they can spread it to people.
In the meantime, authorities have killed more than 1 million minks at breeding farms in both countries as a precaution.
The virus that first infected people in China late last year came from an animal source, probably bats, and later spread from person to person, as other coronaviruses had done in the past. Some animals, including cats, tigers and dogs, have picked up the new coronavirus from people, but there hasn't been a documented case of animals spreading it back to humans.
The outbreaks among the minks on the farms in the Netherlands and Spain likely started with infected workers, although officials aren't certain. But it also is ""plausible"" that some workers later caught the virus back from the minks, the Dutch government and a researcher said, and scientists are exploring whether that was the case and how much of a threat such a spread might be.
The outbreak at the Spanish mink farm near La Puebla de Valverde, a village of 500 people, was discovered after seven of the 14 employees, including the owner, tested positive in late May, said Joaquín Olona, regional chief of agriculture and environment. Two other employees got infected even after the operation was shut down.
More than 92,000 minks were ordered killed at the farm in the Aragon region of northeastern Spain, with nine out of 10 animals estimated to have contracted the virus.
After the Dutch outbreaks began in April, professor Wim van der Poel, a veterinarian who studies viruses at Wageningen University and Research, determined that the virus strain in the animals was similar to the one circulating among humans.
""We assumed it was possible that it would be transmitted back to people again,"" the virus expert said, and that's what appeared to have happened with at least two of the infected workers.
Richard Ostfeld, a researcher at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York, said that if confirmed, these would be the first known instances of animal-to-human transmission.
""With the evidence for farmed mink-to-human transmission, we definitely need to be concerned with the potential for domesticated animals that are infected to pass on their infection to us,"" Ostfeld said by email.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to humans and then spread between people, but it adds that this is rare.
Both the World Health Organization and the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health, are studying the transmission of the virus between animals and people. Several universities and research institutes also are examining the issue.
The WHO has noted that the transmission on the mink breeding farms could have happened both ways. But WHO's Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said at a news conference last month that such transmission was ""very limited.""
""This gives us some clues about which animals may be susceptible to infection and this will help us as we learn more about the potential animal reservoir of (the virus),"" she said, referring to cases in the Netherlands and Denmark, another major producer of mink fur.
While scientists think the virus originated in bats, it may have passed through another animal before infecting people. A WHO team is currently in China, planning to study the issue.
More than 1.1 million minks have been killed on 26 Dutch farms that recorded outbreaks, according to the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority. The government announced Thursday that minks at a 27th farm also were infected and would be killed. The Netherlands, which has some 160 mink farms, is the world's fourth-biggest producer of the prized fur after Denmark, China and Poland, according to Wim Verhagen, director of the Dutch federation of fur farmers. Spain has 38 active mink breeding operations, most of them in northwestern Galicia.
Both Spain and the Netherlands have tightened hygiene protocols at mink farms and banned transportation of the animals and visits to the buildings where they are kept.
China, which produces about a third of the mink fur market, and the United States have not reported any virus outbreaks in minks or animals at other farms."

U.S. health authorities hope by late next month to have some draft guidance on how to ration initial doses, but it’s a vexing decision.
“Not everybody’s going to like the answer,” Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, recently told one of the advisory groups the government asked to help decide. “There will be many people who feel that they should have been at the top of the list.”
Traditionally, first in line for a scarce vaccine are health workers and the people most vulnerable to the targeted infection.
But Collins tossed new ideas into the mix: Consider geography and give priority to people where an outbreak is hitting hardest.
And don’t forget volunteers in the final stage of vaccine testing who get dummy shots, the comparison group needed to tell if the real shots truly work.
“We owe them ... some special priority,” Collins said.
Huge studies this summer aim to prove which of several experimental COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. began tests last week that eventually will include 30,000 volunteers each; in the next few months, equally large calls for volunteers will go out to test shots made by AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax. And some vaccines made in China are in smaller late-stage studies in other countries.
For all the promises of the U.S. stockpiling millions of doses, the hard truth: Even if a vaccine is declared safe and effective by year's end, there won’t be enough for everyone who wants it right away -- especially as most potential vaccines require two doses.
It’s a global dilemma. The World Health Organization is grappling with the same who-goes-first question as it tries to ensure vaccines are fairly distributed to poor countries -- decisions made even harder as wealthy nations corner the market for the first doses.
In the U.S., the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a group established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is supposed to recommend who to vaccinate and when -- advice that the government almost always follows.
But a COVID-19 vaccine decision is so tricky that this time around, ethicists and vaccine experts from the National Academy of Medicine, chartered by Congress to advise the government, are being asked to weigh in, too.
Setting priorities will require “creative, moral common sense,” said Bill Foege, who devised the vaccination strategy that led to global eradication of smallpox. Foege is co-leading the academy’s deliberations, calling it “both this opportunity and this burden.”
With vaccine misinformation abounding and fears that politics might intrude, CDC Director Robert Redfield said the public must see vaccine allocation as “equitable, fair and transparent.”
How to decide? The CDC’s opening suggestion: First vaccinate 12 million of the most critical health, national security and other essential workers. Next would be 110 million people at high risk from the coronavirus -- those over 65 who live in long-term care facilities, or those of any age who are in poor health -- or who also are deemed essential workers. The general population would come later.
CDC’s vaccine advisers wanted to know who’s really essential. “I wouldn’t consider myself a critical health care worker,” admitted Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a pediatrician at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Indeed, the risks for health workers today are far different than in the pandemic’s early days. Now, health workers in COVID-19 treatment units often are the best protected; others may be more at risk, committee members noted.
Beyond the health and security fields, does “essential” mean poultry plant workers or schoolteachers? And what if the vaccine doesn’t work as well among vulnerable populations as among younger, healthier people? It’s a real worry, given that older people’s immune systems don’t rev up as well to flu vaccine.
With Black, Latino and Native American populations disproportionately hit by the coronavirus, failing to address that diversity means “whatever comes out of our group will be looked at very suspiciously,” said ACIP chairman Dr. Jose Romero, Arkansas’ interim health secretary.
Consider the urban poor who live in crowded conditions, have less access to health care and can’t work from home like more privileged Americans, added Dr. Sharon Frey of St. Louis University.
And it may be worth vaccinating entire families rather than trying to single out just one high-risk person in a household, said Dr. Henry Bernstein of Northwell Health.
Whoever gets to go first, a mass vaccination campaign while people are supposed to be keeping their distance is a tall order. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, families waited in long lines in parking lots and at health departments when their turn came up, crowding that authorities know they must avoid this time around.
Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s effort to speed vaccine manufacturing and distribution, is working out how to rapidly transport the right number of doses to wherever vaccinations are set to occur.
Drive-through vaccinations, pop-up clinics and other innovative ideas are all on the table, said CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier.
As soon as a vaccine is declared effective, “we want to be able the next day, frankly, to start these programs,” Messonnier said. “It’s a long road.”"
